[SHK] Nay but this dotage of our general 's
[SHK] O'erflows the measure those his goodly eyes
[SHK] That o'er the files and musters of the war
[SHK] Have glow 'd like plated Mars now bend now turn
[SHK] The office and devotion of their view
[SHK] Upon a tawny front his captain 's heart
[SHK] Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
[SHK] The buckles on his breast reneges all temper
[SHK] And is become the bellows and the fan
[SHK] To cool a gipsy 's lust
[SHK] Look where they come
[SHK] Take but good note and you shall see in him
[SHK] The triple pillar of the world transform 'd
[SHK] Into a strumpet 's fool behold and see
[SHK] If it be love indeed tell me how much
[SHK] There 's beggary in the love that can be reckon 'd
[SHK] I 'll set a bourn how far to be beloved
[SHK] Then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth
[SHK] News my good lord from Rome
[SHK] Grates me the sum
[SHK] Nay hear them Antony
[SHK] Fulvia perchance is angry or who knows
[SHK] If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
[SHK] His powerful mandate to you 'Do this or this
[SHK] Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that
[SHK] Perform 't or else we damn thee
[SHK] How my love
[SHK] Perchance nay and most like
[SHK] You must not stay here longer your dismission
[SHK] Is come from Caesar therefore hear it Antony
[SHK] Where 's Fulvia 's process Caesar 's I would say both
[SHK] Call in the messengers As I am Egypt 's queen
[SHK] Thou blushest Antony and that blood of thine
[SHK] Is Caesar 's homager else so thy cheek pays shame
[SHK] When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds The messengers
[SHK] Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch
[SHK] Of the ranged empire fall Here is my space
[SHK] Kingdoms are clay our dungy earth alike
[SHK] Feeds beast as man the nobleness of life
[SHK] Is to do thus when such a mutual pair
[SHK] And such a twain can do't in which I bind
[SHK] On pain of punishment the world to weet
[SHK] We stand up peerless
[SHK] Excellent falsehood
[SHK] Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her
[SHK] I 'll seem the fool I am not Antony
[SHK] Will be himself
[SHK] But stirr 'd by Cleopatra
[SHK] Now for the love of Love and her soft hours
[SHK] Let 's not confound the time with conference harsh
[SHK] There 's not a minute of our lives should stretch
[SHK] Without some pleasure now What sport tonight
[SHK] Hear the ambassadors
[SHK] Fie wrangling queen
[SHK] Whom every thing becomes to chide to laugh
[SHK] To weep whose every passion fully strives
[SHK] To make itself in thee fair and admired
[SHK] No messenger but thine and all alone
[SHK] To-night we 'll wander through the streets and note
[SHK] The qualities of people Come my queen
[SHK] Last night you did desire it speak not to us
[SHK] Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight
[SHK] Sir sometimes when he is not Antony
[SHK] He comes too short of that great property
[SHK] Which still should go with Antony
[SHK] I am full sorry
[SHK] That he approves the common liar who
[SHK] Thus speaks of him at Rome but I will hope
[SHK] Of better deeds to-morrow Rest you happy
[SHK] Lord Alexas sweet Alexas most any thing Alexas
[SHK] almost most absolute Alexas where 's the soothsayer
[SHK] that you praised so to the queen O that I knew
[SHK] this husband which you say must charge his horns
[SHK] with garlands
[SHK] Soothsayer
[SHK] Your will
[SHK] Is this the man Is't you sir that know things
[SHK] In nature 's infinite book of secrecy
[SHK] A little I can read
[SHK] Show him your hand
[SHK] Bring in the banquet quickly wine enough
[SHK] Cleopatra 's health to drink
[SHK] Good sir give me good fortune
[SHK] I make not but foresee
[SHK] Pray then foresee me one
[SHK] You shall be yet far fairer than you are
[SHK] He means in flesh
[SHK] No you shall paint when you are old
[SHK] Wrinkles forbid
[SHK] Vex not his prescience be attentive
[SHK] Hush
[SHK] You shall be more beloving than beloved
[SHK] I had rather heat my liver with drinking
[SHK] Nay hear him
[SHK] Good now some excellent fortune Let me be married
[SHK] to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all
[SHK] let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod of Jewry
[SHK] may do homage find me to marry me with Octavius
[SHK] Caesar and companion me with my mistress
[SHK] You shall outlive the lady whom you serve
[SHK] O excellent I love long life better than figs
[SHK] You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
[SHK] Than that which is to approach
[SHK] Then belike my children shall have no names
[SHK] prithee how many boys and wenches must I have
[SHK] If every of your wishes had a womb
[SHK] And fertile every wish a million
[SHK] Out fool I forgive thee for a witch
[SHK] You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes
[SHK] Nay come tell Iras hers
[SHK] We 'll know all our fortunes
[SHK] Mine and most of our fortunes to-night shall
[SHK] be -- drunk to bed
[SHK] There 's a palm presages chastity if nothing else
[SHK] E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine
[SHK] Go you wild bedfellow you can not soothsay
[SHK] Nay if an oily palm be not a fruitful
[SHK] prognostication I can not scratch mine ear Prithee
[SHK] tell her but a worky-day fortune
[SHK] Your fortunes are alike
[SHK] But how but how give me particulars
[SHK] I have said
[SHK] Am I not an inch of fortune better than she
[SHK] Well if you were but an inch of fortune better than
[SHK] I where would you choose it
[SHK] Not in my husband 's nose
[SHK] Our worser thoughts heavens mend Alexas -- come
[SHK] his fortune his fortune O let him marry a woman
[SHK] that can not go sweet Isis I beseech thee and let
[SHK] her die too and give him a worse and let worst
[SHK] follow worse till the worst of all follow him
[SHK] laughing to his grave fifty-fold a cuckold Good
[SHK] Isis hear me this prayer though thou deny me a
[SHK] matter of more weight good Isis I beseech thee
[SHK] Amen Dear goddess hear that prayer of the people
[SHK] for as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
[SHK] loose-wived so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
[SHK] foul knave uncuckolded therefore dear Isis keep
[SHK] decorum and fortune him accordingly
[SHK] Amen
[SHK] Lo now if it lay in their hands to make me a
[SHK] cuckold they would make themselves whores but
[SHK] they'ld do't
[SHK] Hush here comes Antony
[SHK] Not he the queen
[SHK] Saw you my lord
[SHK] No lady
[SHK] Was he not here
[SHK] No madam
[SHK] He was disposed to mirth but on the sudden
[SHK] A Roman thought hath struck him Enobarbus
[SHK] Madam
[SHK] Seek him and bring him hither
[SHK] Where 's Alexas
[SHK] Here at your service My lord approaches
[SHK] We will not look upon him go with us
[SHK] Fulvia thy wife first came into the field
[SHK] Against my brother Lucius
[SHK] Ay
[SHK] But soon that war had end and the time 's state
[SHK] Made friends of them joining their force 'gainst Caesar
[SHK] Whose better issue in the war from Italy
[SHK] Upon the first encounter drave them
[SHK] Well what worst
[SHK] The nature of bad news infects the teller
[SHK] When it concerns the fool or coward On
[SHK] Things that are past are done with me 'T is thus
[SHK] Who tells me true though in his tale lie death
[SHK] I hear him as he flatter 'd
[SHK] Labienus --
[SHK] This is stiff news -- hath with his Parthian force
[SHK] Extended Asia from Euphrates
[SHK] His conquering banner shook from Syria
[SHK] To Lydia and to Ionia Whilst --
[SHK] Antony thou wouldst say --
[SHK] O my lord
[SHK] Speak to me home mince not the general tongue
[SHK] Name Cleopatra as she is call 'd in Rome
[SHK] Rail thou in Fulvia 's phrase and taunt my faults
[SHK] With such full licence as both truth and malice
[SHK] Have power to utter O then we bring forth weeds
[SHK] When our quick minds lie still and our ills told us
[SHK] Is as our earing Fare thee well awhile
[SHK] At your noble pleasure
[SHK] From Sicyon ho the news Speak there
[SHK] The man from Sicyon -- is there such an one
[SHK] He stays upon your will
[SHK] Let him appear
[SHK] These strong Egyptian fetters I must break
[SHK] Or lose myself in dotage
[SHK] What are you
[SHK] Fulvia thy wife is dead
[SHK] Where died she
[SHK] In Sicyon
[SHK] Her length of sickness with what else more serious
[SHK] Importeth thee to know this bears
[SHK] Forbear me
[SHK] There 's a great spirit gone Thus did I desire it
[SHK] What our contempt doth often hurl from us
[SHK] We wish it ours again the present pleasure
[SHK] By revolution lowering does become
[SHK] The opposite of itself she 's good being gone
[SHK] The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on
[SHK] I must from this enchanting queen break off
[SHK] Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know
[SHK] My idleness doth hatch How now Enobarbus
[SHK] What 's your pleasure sir
[SHK] I must with haste from hence
[SHK] Why then we kill all our women
[SHK] we see how mortal an unkindness is to them
[SHK] if they suffer our departure death 's the word
[SHK] I must be gone
[SHK] Under a compelling occasion let women die it were
[SHK] pity to cast them away for nothing though between
[SHK] them and a great cause they should be esteemed
[SHK] nothing Cleopatra catching but the least noise of
[SHK] this dies instantly I have seen her die twenty
[SHK] times upon far poorer moment I do think there is
[SHK] mettle in death which commits some loving act upon
[SHK] her she hath such a celerity in dying
[SHK] She is cunning past man 's thought
[SHK] Alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but
[SHK] the finest part of pure love we can not call her
[SHK] winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater
[SHK] storms and tempests than almanacs can report this
[SHK] can not be cunning in her if it be she makes a
[SHK] shower of rain as well as Jove
[SHK] Would I had never seen her
[SHK] O sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
[SHK] of work which not to have been blest withal would
[SHK] have discredited your travel
[SHK] Fulvia is dead
[SHK] Sir
[SHK] Fulvia is dead
[SHK] Fulvia
[SHK] Dead
[SHK] Why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice When
[SHK] it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
[SHK] from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth
[SHK] comforting therein that when old robes are worn
[SHK] out there are members to make new If there were
[SHK] no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut
[SHK] and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned
[SHK] with consolation your old smock brings forth a new
[SHK] petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion
[SHK] that should water this sorrow
[SHK] The business she hath broached in the state
[SHK] Can not endure my absence
[SHK] And the business you have broached here can not be
[SHK] without you especially that of Cleopatra 's which
[SHK] wholly depends on your abode
[SHK] No more light answers Let our officers
[SHK] Have notice what we purpose I shall break
[SHK] The cause of our expedience to the queen
[SHK] And get her leave to part For not alone
[SHK] The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches
[SHK] Do strongly speak to us but the letters too
[SHK] Of many our contriving friends in Rome
[SHK] Petition us at home Sextus Pompeius
[SHK] Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands
[SHK] The empire of the sea our slippery people
[SHK] Whose love is never link 'd to the deserver
[SHK] Till his deserts are past begin to throw
[SHK] Pompey the Great and all his dignities
[SHK] Upon his son who high in name and power
[SHK] Higher than both in blood and life stands up
[SHK] For the main soldier whose quality going on
[SHK] The sides o the world may danger much is breeding
[SHK] Which like the courser 's hair hath yet but life
[SHK] And not a serpent 's poison Say our pleasure
[SHK] To such whose place is under us requires
[SHK] Our quick remove from hence
[SHK] I shall do't
[SHK] Where is he
[SHK] I did not see him since
[SHK] See where he is who 's with him what he does
[SHK] I did not send you if you find him sad
[SHK] Say I am dancing if in mirth report
[SHK] That I am sudden sick quick and return
[SHK] Madam methinks if you did love him dearly
[SHK] You do not hold the method to enforce
[SHK] The like from him
[SHK] What should I do I do not
[SHK] In each thing give him way cross him nothing
[SHK] Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him
[SHK] Tempt him not so too far I wish forbear
[SHK] In time we hate that which we often fear
[SHK] But here comes Antony
[SHK] I am sick and sullen
[SHK] I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose --
[SHK] Help me away dear Charmian I shall fall
[SHK] It can not be thus long the sides of nature
[SHK] Will not sustain it
[SHK] Now my dearest queen --
[SHK] Pray you stand further from me
[SHK] What 's the matter
[SHK] I know by that same eye there 's some good news
[SHK] What says the married woman You may go
[SHK] Would she had never given you leave to come
[SHK] Let her not say 't is I that keep you here
[SHK] I have no power upon you hers you are
[SHK] The gods best know --
[SHK] O never was there queen
[SHK] So mightily betray 'd yet at the first
[SHK] I saw the treasons planted
[SHK] Cleopatra --
[SHK] Why should I think you can be mine and true
[SHK] Though you in swearing shake the throned gods
[SHK] Who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness
[SHK] To be entangled with those mouth-made vows
[SHK] Which break themselves in swearing
[SHK] Most sweet queen --
[SHK] Nay pray you seek no colour for your going
[SHK] But bid farewell and go when you sued staying
[SHK] Then was the time for words no going then
[SHK] Eternity was in our lips and eyes
[SHK] Bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor
[SHK] But was a race of heaven they are so still
[SHK] Or thou the greatest soldier of the world
[SHK] Art turn 'd the greatest liar
[SHK] How now lady
[SHK] I would I had thy inches thou shouldst know
[SHK] There were a heart in Egypt
[SHK] Hear me queen
[SHK] The strong necessity of time commands
[SHK] Our services awhile but my full heart
[SHK] Remains in use with you Our Italy
[SHK] Shines o'er with civil swords Sextus Pompeius
[SHK] Makes his approaches to the port of Rome
[SHK] Equality of two domestic powers
[SHK] Breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength
[SHK] Are newly grown to love the condemn 'd Pompey
[SHK] Rich in his father 's honour creeps apace
[SHK] Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
[SHK] Upon the present state whose numbers threaten
[SHK] And quietness grown sick of rest would purge
[SHK] By any desperate change my more particular
[SHK] And that which most with you should safe my going
[SHK] Is Fulvia 's death
[SHK] Though age from folly could not give me freedom
[SHK] It does from childishness can Fulvia die
[SHK] She 's dead my queen
[SHK] Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
[SHK] The garboils she awaked at the last best
[SHK] See when and where she died
[SHK] O most false love
[SHK] Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
[SHK] With sorrowful water Now I see I see
[SHK] In Fulvia 's death how mine received shall be
[SHK] Quarrel no more but be prepared to know
[SHK] The purposes I bear which are or cease
[SHK] As you shall give the advice By the fire
[SHK] That quickens Nilus slime I go from hence
[SHK] Thy soldier servant making peace or war
[SHK] As thou affect'st
[SHK] Cut my lace Charmian come
[SHK] But let it be I am quickly ill and well
[SHK] So Antony loves
[SHK] My precious queen forbear
[SHK] And give true evidence to his love which stands
[SHK] An honourable trial
[SHK] So Fulvia told me
[SHK] I prithee turn aside and weep for her
[SHK] Then bid adieu to me and say the tears
[SHK] Belong to Egypt good now play one scene
[SHK] Of excellent dissembling and let it look
[SHK] Life perfect honour
[SHK] You 'll heat my blood no more
[SHK] You can do better yet but this is meetly
[SHK] Now by my sword --
[SHK] And target Still he mends
[SHK] But this is not the best Look prithee Charmian
[SHK] How this Herculean Roman does become
[SHK] The carriage of his chafe
[SHK] I 'll leave you lady
[SHK] Courteous lord one word
[SHK] Sir you and I must part but that 's not it
[SHK] Sir you and I have loved but there 's not it
[SHK] That you know well something it is I would
[SHK] O my oblivion is a very Antony
[SHK] And I am all forgotten
[SHK] But that your royalty
[SHK] Holds idleness your subject I should take you
[SHK] For idleness itself
[SHK] 'T is sweating labour
[SHK] To bear such idleness so near the heart
[SHK] As Cleopatra this But sir forgive me
[SHK] Since my becomings kill me when they do not
[SHK] Eye well to you your honour calls you hence
[SHK] Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
[SHK] And all the gods go with you upon your sword
[SHK] Sit laurel victory and smooth success
[SHK] Be strew 'd before your feet
[SHK] Let us go Come
[SHK] Our separation so abides and flies
[SHK] That thou residing here go'st yet with me
[SHK] And I hence fleeting here remain with thee Away
[SHK] You may see Lepidus and henceforth know
[SHK] It is not Caesar 's natural vice to hate
[SHK] Our great competitor from Alexandria
[SHK] This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
[SHK] The lamps of night in revel is not more man-like
[SHK] Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy
[SHK] More womanly than he hardly gave audience or
[SHK] Vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there
[SHK] A man who is the abstract of all faults
[SHK] That all men follow
[SHK] I must not think there are
[SHK] Evils enow to darken all his goodness
[SHK] His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
[SHK] More fiery by night 's blackness hereditary
[SHK] Rather than purchased what he can not change
[SHK] Than what he chooses
[SHK] You are too indulgent Let us grant it is not
[SHK] Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy
[SHK] To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
[SHK] And keep the turn of tippling with a slave
[SHK] To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
[SHK] With knaves that smell of sweat say this
[SHK] becomes him --
[SHK] As his composure must be rare indeed
[SHK] Whom these things can not blemish -- yet must Antony
[SHK] No way excuse his soils when we do bear
[SHK] So great weight in his lightness If he fill 'd
[SHK] His vacancy with his voluptuousness
[SHK] Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
[SHK] Call on him for't but to confound such time
[SHK] That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
[SHK] As his own state and ours -- 't is to be chid
[SHK] As we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
[SHK] Pawn their experience to their present pleasure
[SHK] And so rebel to judgment
[SHK] Here 's more news
[SHK] Thy biddings have been done and every hour
[SHK] Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report
[SHK] How 't is abroad Pompey is strong at sea
[SHK] And it appears he is beloved of those
[SHK] That only have fear 'd Caesar to the ports
[SHK] The discontents repair and men 's reports
[SHK] Give him much wrong 'd
[SHK] I should have known no less
[SHK] It hath been taught us from the primal state
[SHK] That he which is was wish 'd until he were
[SHK] And the ebb 'd man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love
[SHK] Comes dear 'd by being lack 'd This common body
[SHK] Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream
[SHK] Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
[SHK] To rot itself with motion
[SHK] Caesar I bring thee word
[SHK] Menecrates and Menas famous pirates
[SHK] Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
[SHK] With keels of every kind many hot inroads
[SHK] They make in Italy the borders maritime
[SHK] Lack blood to think o n't and flush youth revolt
[SHK] No vessel can peep forth but 't is as soon
[SHK] Taken as seen for Pompey 's name strikes more
[SHK] Than could his war resisted
[SHK] Antony
[SHK] Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once
[SHK] Wast beaten from Modena where thou slew'st
[SHK] Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel
[SHK] Did famine follow whom thou fought'st against
[SHK] Though daintily brought up with patience more
[SHK] Than savages could suffer thou didst drink
[SHK] The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
[SHK] Which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign
[SHK] The roughest berry on the rudest hedge
[SHK] Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
[SHK] The barks of trees thou browsed'st on the Alps
[SHK] It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
[SHK] Which some did die to look on and all this --
[SHK] It wounds thine honour that I speak it now --
[SHK] Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
[SHK] So much as lank 'd not
[SHK] 'T is pity of him
[SHK] Let his shames quickly
[SHK] Drive him to Rome 't is time we twain
[SHK] Did show ourselves i the field and to that end
[SHK] Assemble we immediate council Pompey
[SHK] Thrives in our idleness
[SHK] To-morrow Caesar
[SHK] I shall be furnish 'd to inform you rightly
[SHK] Both what by sea and land I can be able
[SHK] To front this present time
[SHK] Till which encounter
[SHK] It is my business too Farewell
[SHK] Farewell my lord what you shall know meantime
[SHK] Of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir
[SHK] To let me be partaker
[SHK] Doubt not sir
[SHK] I knew it for my bond
[SHK] Charmian
[SHK] Madam
[SHK] Ha ha
[SHK] Give me to drink mandragora
[SHK] Why madam
[SHK] That I might sleep out this great gap of time
[SHK] My Antony is away
[SHK] You think of him too much
[SHK] O 't is treason
[SHK] Madam I trust not so
[SHK] Thou eunuch Mardian
[SHK] What 's your highness pleasure
[SHK] Not now to hear thee sing I take no pleasure
[SHK] In aught an eunuch has 't is well for thee
[SHK] That being unseminar 'd thy freer thoughts
[SHK] May not fly forth of Egypt Hast thou affections
[SHK] Yes gracious madam
[SHK] Indeed
[SHK] Not in deed madam for I can do nothing
[SHK] But what indeed is honest to be done
[SHK] Yet have I fierce affections and think
[SHK] What Venus did with Mars
[SHK] O Charmian
[SHK] Where think'st thou he is now Stands he or sits he
[SHK] Or does he walk or is he on his horse
[SHK] O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony
[SHK] Do bravely horse for wot'st thou whom thou movest
[SHK] The demi-Atlas of this earth the arm
[SHK] And burgonet of men He 's speaking now
[SHK] Or murmuring 'Where 's my serpent of old Nile
[SHK] For so he calls me now I feed myself
[SHK] With most delicious poison Think on me
[SHK] That am with Phoebus amorous pinches black
[SHK] And wrinkled deep in time Broad-fronted Caesar
[SHK] When thou wast here above the ground I was
[SHK] A morsel for a monarch and great Pompey
[SHK] Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
[SHK] There would he anchor his aspect and die
[SHK] With looking on his life
[SHK] Sovereign of Egypt hail
[SHK] How much unlike art thou Mark Antony
[SHK] Yet coming from him that great medicine hath
[SHK] With his tinct gilded thee
[SHK] How goes it with my brave Mark Antony
[SHK] Last thing he did dear queen
[SHK] He kiss 'd -- the last of many doubled kisses --
[SHK] This orient pearl His speech sticks in my heart
[SHK] Mine ear must pluck it thence
[SHK] 'Good friend quoth he
[SHK] 'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
[SHK] This treasure of an oyster at whose foot
[SHK] To mend the petty present I will piece
[SHK] Her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east
[SHK] Say thou shall call her mistress So he nodded
[SHK] And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed
[SHK] Who neigh 'd so high that what I would have spoke
[SHK] Was beastly dumb 'd by him
[SHK] What was he sad or merry
[SHK] Like to the time o the year between the extremes
[SHK] Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
[SHK] O well-divided disposition Note him
[SHK] Note him good Charmian 't is the man but note him
[SHK] He was not sad for he would shine on those
[SHK] That make their looks by his he was not merry
[SHK] Which seem 'd to tell them his remembrance lay
[SHK] In Egypt with his joy but between both
[SHK] O heavenly mingle Be'st thou sad or merry
[SHK] The violence of either thee becomes
[SHK] So does it no man else Met'st thou my posts
[SHK] Ay madam twenty several messengers
[SHK] Why do you send so thick
[SHK] Who 's born that day
[SHK] When I forget to send to Antony
[SHK] Shall die a beggar Ink and paper Charmian
[SHK] Welcome my good Alexas Did I Charmian
[SHK] Ever love Caesar so
[SHK] O that brave Caesar
[SHK] Be choked with such another emphasis
[SHK] Say the brave Antony
[SHK] The valiant Caesar
[SHK] By Isis I will give thee bloody teeth
[SHK] If thou with Caesar paragon again
[SHK] My man of men
[SHK] By your most gracious pardon
[SHK] I sing but after you
[SHK] My salad days
[SHK] When I was green in judgment cold in blood
[SHK] To say as I said then But come away
[SHK] Get me ink and paper
[SHK] He shall have every day a several greeting
[SHK] Or I 'll unpeople Egypt
[SHK] If the great gods be just they shall assist
[SHK] The deeds of justest men
[SHK] Know worthy Pompey
[SHK] That what they do delay they not deny
[SHK] Whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
[SHK] The thing we sue for
[SHK] We ignorant of ourselves
[SHK] Beg often our own harms which the wise powers
[SHK] Deny us for our good so find we profit
[SHK] By losing of our prayers
[SHK] I shall do well
[SHK] The people love me and the sea is mine
[SHK] My powers are crescent and my auguring hope
[SHK] Says it will come to the full Mark Antony
[SHK] In Egypt sits at dinner and will make
[SHK] No wars without doors Caesar gets money where
[SHK] He loses hearts Lepidus flatters both
[SHK] Of both is flatter 'd but he neither loves
[SHK] Nor either cares for him
[SHK] Caesar and Lepidus
[SHK] Are in the field a mighty strength they carry
[SHK] Where have you this 't is false
[SHK] From Silvius sir
[SHK] He dreams I know they are in Rome together
[SHK] Looking for Antony But all the charms of love
[SHK] Salt Cleopatra soften thy waned lip
[SHK] Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
[SHK] Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
[SHK] Keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks
[SHK] Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite
[SHK] That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
[SHK] Even till a Lethe 'd dulness
[SHK] How now Varrius
[SHK] This is most certain that I shall deliver
[SHK] Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
[SHK] Expected since he went from Egypt 't is
[SHK] A space for further travel
[SHK] I could have given less matter
[SHK] A better ear Menas I did not think
[SHK] This amorous surfeiter would have donn 'd his helm
[SHK] For such a petty war his soldiership
[SHK] Is twice the other twain but let us rear
[SHK] The higher our opinion that our stirring
[SHK] Can from the lap of Egypt 's widow pluck
[SHK] The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony
[SHK] I can not hope
[SHK] Caesar and Antony shall well greet together
[SHK] His wife that 's dead did trespasses to Caesar
[SHK] His brother warr 'd upon him although I think
[SHK] Not moved by Antony
[SHK] I know not Menas
[SHK] How lesser enmities may give way to greater
[SHK] Were't not that we stand up against them all
[SHK] 'Twere pregnant they should square between
[SHK] themselves
[SHK] For they have entertained cause enough
[SHK] To draw their swords but how the fear of us
[SHK] May cement their divisions and bind up
[SHK] The petty difference we yet not know
[SHK] Be't as our gods will have't It only stands
[SHK] Our lives upon to use our strongest hands
[SHK] Come Menas
[SHK] Good Enobarbus 't is a worthy deed
[SHK] And shall become you well to entreat your captain
[SHK] To soft and gentle speech
[SHK] I shall entreat him
[SHK] To answer like himself if Caesar move him
[SHK] Let Antony look over Caesar 's head
[SHK] And speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter
[SHK] Were I the wearer of Antonius beard
[SHK] I would not shave't to-day
[SHK] 'T is not a time
[SHK] For private stomaching
[SHK] Every time
[SHK] Serves for the matter that is then born i n't
[SHK] But small to greater matters must give way
[SHK] Not if the small come first
[SHK] Your speech is passion
[SHK] But pray you stir no embers up Here comes
[SHK] The noble Antony
[SHK] And yonder Caesar
[SHK] If we compose well here to Parthia
[SHK] Hark Ventidius
[SHK] I do not know
[SHK] Mecaenas ask Agrippa
[SHK] Noble friends
[SHK] That which combined us was most great and let not
[SHK] A leaner action rend us What 's amiss
[SHK] May it be gently heard when we debate
[SHK] Our trivial difference loud we do commit
[SHK] Murder in healing wounds then noble partners
[SHK] The rather for I earnestly beseech
[SHK] Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
[SHK] Nor curstness grow to the matter
[SHK] 'T is spoken well
[SHK] Were we before our armies and to fight
[SHK] I should do thus
[SHK] Welcome to Rome
[SHK] Thank you
[SHK] Sit
[SHK] Sit sir
[SHK] Nay then
[SHK] I learn you take things ill which are not so
[SHK] Or being concern you not
[SHK] I must be laugh 'd at
[SHK] If or for nothing or a little I
[SHK] Should say myself offended and with you
[SHK] Chiefly i the world more laugh 'd at that I should
[SHK] Once name you derogately when to sound your name
[SHK] It not concern 'd me
[SHK] My being in Egypt Caesar
[SHK] What was't to you
[SHK] No more than my residing here at Rome
[SHK] Might be to you in Egypt yet if you there
[SHK] Did practise on my state your being in Egypt
[SHK] Might be my question
[SHK] How intend you practised
[SHK] You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
[SHK] By what did here befal me Your wife and brother
[SHK] Made wars upon me and their contestation
[SHK] Was theme for you you were the word of war
[SHK] You do mistake your business my brother never
[SHK] Did urge me in his act I did inquire it
[SHK] And have my learning from some true reports
[SHK] That drew their swords with you Did he not rather
[SHK] Discredit my authority with yours
[SHK] And make the wars alike against my stomach
[SHK] Having alike your cause Of this my letters
[SHK] Before did satisfy you If you 'll patch a quarrel
[SHK] As matter whole you have not to make it with
[SHK] It must not be with this
[SHK] You praise yourself
[SHK] By laying defects of judgment to me but
[SHK] You patch 'd up your excuses
[SHK] Not so not so
[SHK] I know you could not lack I am certain o n't
[SHK] Very necessity of this thought that I
[SHK] Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought
[SHK] Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
[SHK] Which fronted mine own peace As for my wife
[SHK] I would you had her spirit in such another
[SHK] The third o the world is yours which with a snaffle
[SHK] You may pace easy but not such a wife
[SHK] Would we had all such wives that the men might go
[SHK] to wars with the women
[SHK] So much uncurbable her garboils Caesar
[SHK] Made out of her impatience which not wanted
[SHK] Shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant
[SHK] Did you too much disquiet for that you must
[SHK] But say I could not help it
[SHK] I wrote to you
[SHK] When rioting in Alexandria you
[SHK] Did pocket up my letters and with taunts
[SHK] Did gibe my missive out of audience
[SHK] Sir
[SHK] He fell upon me ere admitted then
[SHK] Three kings I had newly feasted and did want
[SHK] Of what I was i the morning but next day
[SHK] I told him of myself which was as much
[SHK] As to have ask 'd him pardon Let this fellow
[SHK] Be nothing of our strife if we contend
[SHK] Out of our question wipe him
[SHK] You have broken
[SHK] The article of your oath which you shall never
[SHK] Have tongue to charge me with
[SHK] Soft Caesar
[SHK] No
[SHK] Lepidus let him speak
[SHK] The honour is sacred which he talks on now
[SHK] Supposing that I lack 'd it But on Caesar
[SHK] The article of my oath
[SHK] To lend me arms and aid when I required them
[SHK] The which you both denied
[SHK] Neglected rather
[SHK] And then when poison 'd hours had bound me up
[SHK] From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may
[SHK] I 'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty
[SHK] Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
[SHK] Work without it Truth is that Fulvia
[SHK] To have me out of Egypt made wars here
[SHK] For which myself the ignorant motive do
[SHK] So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
[SHK] To stoop in such a case
[SHK] 'T is noble spoken
[SHK] If it might please you to enforce no further
[SHK] The griefs between ye to forget them quite
[SHK] Were to remember that the present need
[SHK] Speaks to atone you
[SHK] Worthily spoken Mecaenas
[SHK] Or if you borrow one another 's love for the
[SHK] instant you may when you hear no more words of
[SHK] Pompey return it again you shall have time to
[SHK] wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
[SHK] Thou art a soldier only speak no more
[SHK] That truth should be silent I had almost forgot
[SHK] You wrong this presence therefore speak no more
[SHK] Go to then your considerate stone
[SHK] I do not much dislike the matter but
[SHK] The manner of his speech for't can not be
[SHK] We shall remain in friendship our conditions
[SHK] So differing in their acts Yet if I knew
[SHK] What hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
[SHK] O the world I would pursue it
[SHK] Give me leave Caesar --
[SHK] Speak Agrippa
[SHK] Thou hast a sister by the mother 's side
[SHK] Admired Octavia great Mark Antony
[SHK] Is now a widower
[SHK] Say not so Agrippa
[SHK] If Cleopatra heard you your reproof
[SHK] Were well deserved of rashness
[SHK] I am not married Caesar let me hear
[SHK] Agrippa further speak
[SHK] To hold you in perpetual amity
[SHK] To make you brothers and to knit your hearts
[SHK] With an unslipping knot take Antony
[SHK] Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
[SHK] No worse a husband than the best of men
[SHK] Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
[SHK] That which none else can utter By this marriage
[SHK] All little jealousies which now seem great
[SHK] And all great fears which now import their dangers
[SHK] Would then be nothing truths would be tales
[SHK] Where now half tales be truths her love to both
[SHK] Would each to other and all loves to both
[SHK] Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke
[SHK] For 't is a studied not a present thought
[SHK] By duty ruminated
[SHK] Will Caesar speak
[SHK] Not till he hears how Antony is touch 'd
[SHK] With what is spoke already
[SHK] What power is in Agrippa
[SHK] If I would say 'Agrippa be it so
[SHK] To make this good
[SHK] The power of Caesar and
[SHK] His power unto Octavia
[SHK] May I never
[SHK] To this good purpose that so fairly shows
[SHK] Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand
[SHK] Further this act of grace and from this hour
[SHK] The heart of brothers govern in our loves
[SHK] And sway our great designs
[SHK] There is my hand
[SHK] A sister I bequeath you whom no brother
[SHK] Did ever love so dearly let her live
[SHK] To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
[SHK] Fly off our loves again
[SHK] Happily amen
[SHK] I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey
[SHK] For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
[SHK] Of late upon me I must thank him only
[SHK] Lest my remembrance suffer ill report
[SHK] At heel of that defy him
[SHK] Time calls upon 's
[SHK] Of us must Pompey presently be sought
[SHK] Or else he seeks out us
[SHK] Where lies he
[SHK] About the mount Misenum
[SHK] What is his strength by land
[SHK] Great and increasing but by sea
[SHK] He is an absolute master
[SHK] So is the fame
[SHK] Would we had spoke together Haste we for it
[SHK] Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
[SHK] The business we have talk 'd of
[SHK] With most gladness
[SHK] And do invite you to my sister 's view
[SHK] Whither straight I 'll lead you
[SHK] Let us Lepidus
[SHK] Not lack your company
[SHK] Noble Antony
[SHK] Not sickness should detain me
[SHK] Welcome from Egypt sir
[SHK] Half the heart of Caesar worthy Mecaenas My
[SHK] honourable friend Agrippa
[SHK] Good Enobarbus
[SHK] We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
[SHK] digested You stayed well by 't in Egypt
[SHK] Ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and
[SHK] made the night light with drinking
[SHK] Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast and
[SHK] but twelve persons there is this true
[SHK] This was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more
[SHK] monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
[SHK] She 's a most triumphant lady if report be square to
[SHK] her
[SHK] When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up
[SHK] his heart upon the river of Cydnus
[SHK] There she appeared indeed or my reporter devised
[SHK] well for her
[SHK] I will tell you
[SHK] The barge she sat in like a burnish 'd throne
[SHK] Burn 'd on the water the poop was beaten gold
[SHK] Purple the sails and so perfumed that
[SHK] The winds were love-sick with them the oars were silver
[SHK] Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
[SHK] The water which they beat to follow faster
[SHK] As amorous of their strokes For her own person
[SHK] It beggar 'd all description she did lie
[SHK] In her pavilion -- cloth-of-gold of tissue --
[SHK] O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
[SHK] The fancy outwork nature on each side her
[SHK] Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids
[SHK] With divers-colour 'd fans whose wind did seem
[SHK] To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
[SHK] And what they undid did
[SHK] O rare for Antony
[SHK] Her gentlewomen like the Nereides
[SHK] So many mermaids tended her i the eyes
[SHK] And made their bends adornings at the helm
[SHK] A seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
[SHK] Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
[SHK] That yarely frame the office From the barge
[SHK] A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
[SHK] Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast
[SHK] Her people out upon her and Antony
[SHK] Enthroned i the market-place did sit alone
[SHK] Whistling to the air which but for vacancy
[SHK] Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
[SHK] And made a gap in nature
[SHK] Rare Egyptian
[SHK] Upon her landing Antony sent to her
[SHK] Invited her to supper she replied
[SHK] It should be better he became her guest
[SHK] Which she entreated our courteous Antony
[SHK] Whom ne'er the word of 'No woman heard speak
[SHK] Being barber 'd ten times o'er goes to the feast
[SHK] And for his ordinary pays his heart
[SHK] For what his eyes eat only
[SHK] Royal wench
[SHK] She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed
[SHK] He plough 'd her and she cropp 'd
[SHK] I saw her once
[SHK] Hop forty paces through the public street
[SHK] And having lost her breath she spoke and panted
[SHK] That she did make defect perfection
[SHK] And breathless power breathe forth
[SHK] Now Antony must leave her utterly
[SHK] Never he will not
[SHK] Age can not wither her nor custom stale
[SHK] Her infinite variety other women cloy
[SHK] The appetites they feed but she makes hungry
[SHK] Where most she satisfies for vilest things
[SHK] Become themselves in her that the holy priests
[SHK] Bless her when she is riggish
[SHK] If beauty wisdom modesty can settle
[SHK] The heart of Antony Octavia is
[SHK] A blessed lottery to him
[SHK] Let us go
[SHK] Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest
[SHK] Whilst you abide here
[SHK] Humbly sir I thank you
[SHK] The world and my great office will sometimes
[SHK] Divide me from your bosom
[SHK] All which time
[SHK] Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
[SHK] To them for you
[SHK] Good night sir My Octavia
[SHK] Read not my blemishes in the world 's report
[SHK] I have not kept my square but that to come
[SHK] Shall all be done by the rule Good night dear lady
[SHK] Good night sir
[SHK] Good night
[SHK] Now sirrah you do wish yourself in Egypt
[SHK] Would I had never come from thence nor you Thither
[SHK] If you can your reason
[SHK] I see it in
[SHK] My motion have it not in my tongue but yet
[SHK] Hie you to Egypt again
[SHK] Say to me
[SHK] Whose fortunes shall rise higher Caesar 's or mine
[SHK] Caesar 's
[SHK] Therefore O Antony stay not by his side
[SHK] Thy demon that 's thy spirit which keeps thee is
[SHK] Noble courageous high unmatchable
[SHK] Where Caesar 's is not but near him thy angel
[SHK] Becomes a fear as being o'erpower 'd therefore
[SHK] Make space enough between you
[SHK] Speak this no more
[SHK] To none but thee no more but when to thee
[SHK] If thou dost play with him at any game
[SHK] Thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck
[SHK] He beats thee 'gainst the odds thy lustre thickens
[SHK] When he shines by I say again thy spirit
[SHK] Is all afraid to govern thee near him
[SHK] But he away 't is noble
[SHK] Get thee gone
[SHK] Say to Ventidius I would speak with him
[SHK] He shall to Parthia Be it art or hap
[SHK] He hath spoken true the very dice obey him
[SHK] And in our sports my better cunning faints
[SHK] Under his chance if we draw lots he speeds
[SHK] His cocks do win the battle still of mine
[SHK] When it is all to nought and his quails ever
[SHK] Beat mine inhoop 'd at odds I will to Egypt
[SHK] And though I make this marriage for my peace
[SHK] I the east my pleasure lies
[SHK] O come Ventidius
[SHK] You must to Parthia your commission 's ready
[SHK] Follow me and receive't
[SHK] Trouble yourselves no further pray you hasten
[SHK] Your generals after
[SHK] Sir Mark Antony
[SHK] Will e'en but kiss Octavia and we 'll follow
[SHK] Till I shall see you in your soldier 's dress
[SHK] Which will become you both farewell
[SHK] We shall
[SHK] As I conceive the journey be at the Mount
[SHK] Before you Lepidus
[SHK] Your way is shorter
[SHK] My purposes do draw me much about
[SHK] You 'll win two days upon me
[SHK] Sir good success
[SHK] Farewell
[SHK] Give me some music music moody food
[SHK] Of us that trade in love
[SHK] The music ho
[SHK] Let it alone let 's to billiards come Charmian
[SHK] My arm is sore best play with Mardian
[SHK] As well a woman with an eunuch play 'd
[SHK] As with a woman Come you 'll play with me sir
[SHK] As well as I can madam
[SHK] And when good will is show 'd though't come
[SHK] too short
[SHK] The actor may plead pardon I 'll none now
[SHK] Give me mine angle we 'll to the river there
[SHK] My music playing far off I will betray
[SHK] Tawny-finn 'd fishes my bended hook shall pierce
[SHK] Their slimy jaws and as I draw them up
[SHK] I 'll think them every one an Antony
[SHK] And say 'Ah ha you 're caught
[SHK] 'T was merry when
[SHK] You wager 'd on your angling when your diver
[SHK] Did hang a salt-fish on his hook which he
[SHK] With fervency drew up
[SHK] That time -- O times --
[SHK] I laugh 'd him out of patience and that night
[SHK] I laugh 'd him into patience and next morn
[SHK] Ere the ninth hour I drunk him to his bed
[SHK] Then put my tires and mantles on him whilst
[SHK] I wore his sword Philippan
[SHK] O from Italy
[SHK] Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears
[SHK] That long time have been barren
[SHK] Madam madam --
[SHK] Antonius dead -- If thou say so villain
[SHK] Thou kill'st thy mistress but well and free
[SHK] If thou so yield him there is gold and here
[SHK] My bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings
[SHK] Have lipp 'd and trembled kissing
[SHK] First madam he is well
[SHK] Why there 's more gold
[SHK] But sirrah mark we use
[SHK] To say the dead are well bring it to that
[SHK] The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
[SHK] Down thy ill-uttering throat
[SHK] Good madam hear me
[SHK] Well go to I will
[SHK] But there 's no goodness in thy face if Antony
[SHK] Be free and healthful -- so tart a favour
[SHK] To trumpet such good tidings If not well
[SHK] Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown 'd with snakes
[SHK] Not like a formal man
[SHK] Will't please you hear me
[SHK] I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st
[SHK] Yet if thou say Antony lives is well
[SHK] Or friends with Caesar or not captive to him
[SHK] I 'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail
[SHK] Rich pearls upon thee
[SHK] Madam he 's well
[SHK] Well said
[SHK] And friends with Caesar
[SHK] Thou'rt an honest man
[SHK] Caesar and he are greater friends than ever
[SHK] Make thee a fortune from me
[SHK] But yet madam --
[SHK] I do not like 'But yet it does allay
[SHK] The good precedence fie upon 'But yet
[SHK] 'But yet is as a gaoler to bring forth
[SHK] Some monstrous malefactor Prithee friend
[SHK] Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear
[SHK] The good and bad together he 's friends with Caesar
[SHK] In state of health thou say'st and thou say'st free
[SHK] Free madam no I made no such report
[SHK] He 's bound unto Octavia
[SHK] For what good turn
[SHK] For the best turn i the bed
[SHK] I am pale Charmian
[SHK] Madam he 's married to Octavia
[SHK] The most infectious pestilence upon thee
[SHK] Good madam patience
[SHK] What say you Hence
[SHK] Horrible villain or I 'll spurn thine eyes
[SHK] Like balls before me I 'll unhair thy head
[SHK] Thou shalt be whipp 'd with wire and stew 'd in brine
[SHK] Smarting in lingering pickle
[SHK] Gracious madam
[SHK] I that do bring the news made not the match
[SHK] Say 't is not so a province I will give thee
[SHK] And make thy fortunes proud the blow thou hadst
[SHK] Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage
[SHK] And I will boot thee with what gift beside
[SHK] Thy modesty can beg
[SHK] He 's married madam
[SHK] Rogue thou hast lived too long
[SHK] Nay then I 'll run
[SHK] What mean you madam I have made no fault
[SHK] Good madam keep yourself within yourself
[SHK] The man is innocent
[SHK] Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt
[SHK] Melt Egypt into Nile and kindly creatures
[SHK] Turn all to serpents Call the slave again
[SHK] Though I am mad I will not bite him call
[SHK] He is afeard to come
[SHK] I will not hurt him
[SHK] These hands do lack nobility that they strike
[SHK] A meaner than myself since I myself
[SHK] Have given myself the cause
[SHK] Come hither sir
[SHK] Though it be honest it is never good
[SHK] To bring bad news give to a gracious message
[SHK] An host of tongues but let ill tidings tell
[SHK] Themselves when they be felt
[SHK] I have done my duty
[SHK] Is he married
[SHK] I can not hate thee worser than I do
[SHK] If thou again say 'Yes
[SHK] He 's married madam
[SHK] The gods confound thee dost thou hold there still
[SHK] Should I lie madam
[SHK] O I would thou didst
[SHK] So half my Egypt were submerged and made
[SHK] A cistern for scaled snakes Go get thee hence
[SHK] Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face to me
[SHK] Thou wouldst appear most ugly He is married
[SHK] I crave your highness pardon
[SHK] He is married
[SHK] Take no offence that I would not offend you
[SHK] To punish me for what you make me do
[SHK] Seems much unequal he 's married to Octavia
[SHK] O that his fault should make a knave of thee
[SHK] That art not what thou'rt sure of Get thee hence
[SHK] The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
[SHK] Are all too dear for me lie they upon thy hand
[SHK] And be undone by 'em
[SHK] Good your highness patience
[SHK] In praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar
[SHK] Many times madam
[SHK] I am paid for't now
[SHK] Lead me from hence
[SHK] I faint O Iras Charmian 't is no matter
[SHK] Go to the fellow good Alexas bid him
[SHK] Report the feature of Octavia her years
[SHK] Her inclination let him not leave out
[SHK] The colour of her hair bring me word quickly
[SHK] Let him for ever go -- let him not -- Charmian
[SHK] Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon
[SHK] The other way 's a Mars Bid you Alexas
[SHK] Bring me word how tall she is Pity me Charmian
[SHK] But do not speak to me Lead me to my chamber
[SHK] Your hostages I have so have you mine
[SHK] And we shall talk before we fight
[SHK] Most meet
[SHK] That first we come to words and therefore have we
[SHK] Our written purposes before us sent
[SHK] Which if thou hast consider 'd let us know
[SHK] If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
[SHK] And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
[SHK] That else must perish here
[SHK] To you all three
[SHK] The senators alone of this great world
[SHK] Chief factors for the gods I do not know
[SHK] Wherefore my father should revengers want
[SHK] Having a son and friends since Julius Caesar
[SHK] Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted
[SHK] There saw you labouring for him What was't
[SHK] That moved pale Cassius to conspire and what
[SHK] Made the all-honour 'd honest Roman Brutus
[SHK] With the arm 'd rest courtiers and beauteous freedom
[SHK] To drench the Capitol but that they would
[SHK] Have one man but a man And that is it
[SHK] Hath made me rig my navy at whose burthen
[SHK] The anger 'd ocean foams with which I meant
[SHK] To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
[SHK] Cast on my noble father
[SHK] Take your time
[SHK] Thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails
[SHK] We 'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st
[SHK] How much we do o'er-count thee
[SHK] At land indeed
[SHK] Thou dost o'er-count me of my father 's house
[SHK] But since the cuckoo builds not for himself
[SHK] Remain i n't as thou mayst
[SHK] Be pleased to tell us --
[SHK] For this is from the present -- how you take
[SHK] The offers we have sent you
[SHK] There 's the point
[SHK] Which do not be entreated to but weigh
[SHK] What it is worth embraced
[SHK] And what may follow
[SHK] To try a larger fortune
[SHK] You have made me offer
[SHK] Of Sicily Sardinia and I must
[SHK] Rid all the sea of pirates then to send
[SHK] Measures of wheat to Rome this 'greed upon
[SHK] To part with unhack 'd edges and bear back
[SHK] Our targes undinted
[SHK] That 's our offer
[SHK] Know then
[SHK] I came before you here a man prepared
[SHK] To take this offer but Mark Antony
[SHK] Put me to some impatience though I lose
[SHK] The praise of it by telling you must know
[SHK] When Caesar and your brother were at blows
[SHK] Your mother came to Sicily and did find
[SHK] Her welcome friendly
[SHK] I have heard it Pompey
[SHK] And am well studied for a liberal thanks
[SHK] Which I do owe you
[SHK] Let me have your hand
[SHK] I did not think sir to have met you here
[SHK] The beds i the east are soft and thanks to you
[SHK] That call 'd me timelier than my purpose hither
[SHK] For I have gain 'd by 't
[SHK] Since I saw you last
[SHK] There is a change upon you
[SHK] Well I know not
[SHK] What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face
[SHK] But in my bosom shall she never come
[SHK] To make my heart her vassal
[SHK] Well met here
[SHK] I hope so Lepidus Thus we are agreed
[SHK] I crave our composition may be written
[SHK] And seal 'd between us
[SHK] That 's the next to do
[SHK] We 'll feast each other ere we part and let 's
[SHK] Draw lots who shall begin
[SHK] That will I Pompey
[SHK] No Antony take the lot but first
[SHK] Or last your fine Egyptian cookery
[SHK] Shall have the fame I have heard that Julius Caesar
[SHK] Grew fat with feasting there
[SHK] You have heard much
[SHK] I have fair meanings sir
[SHK] And fair words to them
[SHK] Then so much have I heard
[SHK] And I have heard Apollodorus carried --
[SHK] No more of that he did so
[SHK] What I pray you
[SHK] A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress
[SHK] I know thee now how farest thou soldier
[SHK] Well
[SHK] And well am like to do for I perceive
[SHK] Four feasts are toward
[SHK] Let me shake thy hand
[SHK] I never hated thee I have seen thee fight
[SHK] When I have envied thy behavior
[SHK] Sir
[SHK] I never loved you much but I ha praised ye
[SHK] When you have well deserved ten times as much
[SHK] As I have said you did
[SHK] Enjoy thy plainness
[SHK] It nothing ill becomes thee
[SHK] Aboard my galley I invite you all
[SHK] Will you lead lords
[SHK] Show us the way sir
[SHK] Come
[SHK] made this treaty. -- You and I have known sir
[SHK] At sea I think
[SHK] We have sir
[SHK] You have done well by water
[SHK] And you by land
[SHK] I will praise any man that will praise me though it
[SHK] can not be denied what I have done by land
[SHK] Nor what I have done by water
[SHK] Yes something you can deny for your own
[SHK] safety you have been a great thief by sea
[SHK] And you by land
[SHK] There I deny my land service But give me your
[SHK] hand Menas if our eyes had authority here they
[SHK] might take two thieves kissing
[SHK] All men 's faces are true whatsome'er their hands are
[SHK] But there is never a fair woman has a true face
[SHK] No slander they steal hearts
[SHK] We came hither to fight with you
[SHK] For my part I am sorry it is turned to a drinking
[SHK] Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
[SHK] If he do sure he can not weep't back again
[SHK] You 've said sir We looked not for Mark Antony
[SHK] here pray you is he married to Cleopatra
[SHK] Caesar 's sister is called Octavia
[SHK] True sir she was the wife of Caius Marcellus
[SHK] But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius
[SHK] Pray ye sir
[SHK] 'T is true
[SHK] Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together
[SHK] If I were bound to divine of this unity I would
[SHK] not prophesy so
[SHK] I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
[SHK] marriage than the love of the parties
[SHK] I think so too But you shall find the band that
[SHK] seems to tie their friendship together will be the
[SHK] very strangler of their amity Octavia is of a
[SHK] holy cold and still conversation
[SHK] Who would not have his wife so
[SHK] Not he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony
[SHK] He will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the
[SHK] sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar and as
[SHK] I said before that which is the strength of their
[SHK] amity shall prove the immediate author of their
[SHK] variance Antony will use his affection where it is
[SHK] he married but his occasion here
[SHK] And thus it may be Come sir will you aboard
[SHK] I have a health for you
[SHK] I shall take it sir we have used our throats in Egypt
[SHK] Come let 's away
[SHK] Here they 'll be man Some o their plants are
[SHK] ill-rooted already the least wind i the world
[SHK] will blow them down
[SHK] Lepidus is high-coloured
[SHK] They have made him drink alms-drink
[SHK] As they pinch one another by the disposition he
[SHK] cries out 'No more reconciles them to his
[SHK] entreaty and himself to the drink
[SHK] But it raises the greater war between him and
[SHK] his discretion
[SHK] Why this is to have a name in great men 's
[SHK] fellowship I had as lief have a reed that will do
[SHK] me no service as a partisan I could not heave
[SHK] To be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen
[SHK] to move i n't are the holes where eyes should be
[SHK] which pitifully disaster the cheeks
[SHK] the flow o the Nile
[SHK] By certain scales i the pyramid they know
[SHK] By the height the lowness or the mean if dearth
[SHK] Or foison follow the higher Nilus swells
[SHK] The more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman
[SHK] Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain
[SHK] And shortly comes to harvest
[SHK] You 've strange serpents there
[SHK] Ay Lepidus
[SHK] Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
[SHK] operation of your sun so is your crocodile
[SHK] They are so
[SHK] Sit -- and some wine A health to Lepidus
[SHK] I am not so well as I should be but I 'll ne'er out
[SHK] Not till you have slept I fear me you 'll be in till then
[SHK] Nay certainly I have heard the Ptolemies
[SHK] pyramises are very goodly things without
[SHK] contradiction I have heard that
[SHK] what is't
[SHK] thee captain
[SHK] And hear me speak a word
[SHK] This wine for Lepidus
[SHK] What manner o thing is your crocodile
[SHK] It is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad
[SHK] as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is
[SHK] and moves with its own organs it lives by that
[SHK] which nourisheth it and the elements once out of
[SHK] it it transmigrates
[SHK] What colour is it of
[SHK] Of it own colour too
[SHK] 'T is a strange serpent
[SHK] 'T is so And the tears of it are wet
[SHK] Will this description satisfy him
[SHK] With the health that Pompey gives him else he is a
[SHK] very epicure
[SHK] that away
[SHK] Do as I bid you Where 's this cup I call 'd for
[SHK] wilt hear me
[SHK] Rise from thy stool
[SHK] The matter
[SHK] I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes
[SHK] Thou hast served me with much faith What 's else to say
[SHK] Be jolly lords
[SHK] These quick-sands Lepidus
[SHK] Keep off them for you sink
[SHK] Wilt thou be lord of all the world
[SHK] What say'st thou
[SHK] Wilt thou be lord of the whole world That 's twice
[SHK] How should that be
[SHK] But entertain it
[SHK] And though thou think me poor I am the man
[SHK] Will give thee all the world
[SHK] Hast thou drunk well
[SHK] Now Pompey I have kept me from the cup
[SHK] Thou art if thou darest be the earthly Jove
[SHK] Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
[SHK] Is thine if thou wilt ha't
[SHK] Show me which way
[SHK] These three world-sharers these competitors
[SHK] Are in thy vessel let me cut the cable
[SHK] And when we are put off fall to their throats
[SHK] All there is thine
[SHK] Ah this thou shouldst have done
[SHK] And not have spoke o n't In me 't is villany
[SHK] In thee't had been good service Thou must know
[SHK] 'T is not my profit that does lead mine honour
[SHK] Mine honour it Repent that e'er thy tongue
[SHK] Hath so betray 'd thine act being done unknown
[SHK] I should have found it afterwards well done
[SHK] But must condemn it now Desist and drink
[SHK] I 'll never follow thy pall 'd fortunes more
[SHK] Who seeks and will not take when once 't is offer 'd
[SHK] Shall never find it more
[SHK] This health to Lepidus
[SHK] Bear him ashore I 'll pledge it for him Pompey
[SHK] Here 's to thee Menas
[SHK] Enobarbus welcome
[SHK] Fill till the cup be hid
[SHK] There 's a strong fellow Menas
[SHK] Why
[SHK] A bears the third part of the world man see'st
[SHK] not
[SHK] The third part then is drunk would it were all
[SHK] That it might go on wheels
[SHK] Drink thou increase the reels
[SHK] Come
[SHK] This is not yet an Alexandrian feast
[SHK] It ripens towards it Strike the vessels ho
[SHK] Here is to Caesar
[SHK] I could well forbear't
[SHK] It 's monstrous labour when I wash my brain
[SHK] And it grows fouler
[SHK] Be a child o the time
[SHK] Possess it I 'll make answer
[SHK] But I had rather fast from all four days
[SHK] Than drink so much in one
[SHK] Ha my brave emperor
[SHK] Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
[SHK] And celebrate our drink
[SHK] Let 's ha't good soldier
[SHK] Come let 's all take hands
[SHK] Till that the conquering wine hath steep 'd our sense
[SHK] In soft and delicate Lethe
[SHK] All take hands
[SHK] Make battery to our ears with the loud music
[SHK] The while I 'll place you then the boy shall sing
[SHK] The holding every man shall bear as loud
[SHK] As his strong sides can volley
[SHK] Come thou monarch of the vine
[SHK] Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne
[SHK] In thy fats our cares be drown 'd
[SHK] With thy grapes our hairs be crown 'd
[SHK] Cup us till the world go round
[SHK] Cup us till the world go round
[SHK] What would you more Pompey good night Good brother
[SHK] Let me request you off our graver business
[SHK] Frowns at this levity Gentle lords let 's part
[SHK] You see we have burnt our cheeks strong Enobarb
[SHK] Is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue
[SHK] Splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost
[SHK] Antick 'd us all What needs more words Good night
[SHK] Good Antony your hand
[SHK] I 'll try you on the shore
[SHK] And shall sir give 's your hand
[SHK] O Antony

[SHK] Noble Ventidius
[SHK] Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
[SHK] The fugitive Parthians follow spur through Media
[SHK] Mesopotamia and the shelters whither
[SHK] The routed fly so thy grand captain Antony
[SHK] Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
[SHK] Put garlands on thy head
[SHK] O Silius Silius
[SHK] I have done enough a lower place note well
[SHK] May make too great an act for learn this Silius
[SHK] Better to leave undone than by our deed
[SHK] Acquire too high a fame when him we serve 's away
[SHK] Caesar and Antony have ever won
[SHK] More in their officer than person Sossius
[SHK] One of my place in Syria his lieutenant
[SHK] For quick accumulation of renown
[SHK] Which he achieved by the minute lost his favour
[SHK] Who does i the wars more than his captain can
[SHK] Becomes his captain 's captain and ambition
[SHK] The soldier 's virtue rather makes choice of loss
[SHK] Than gain which darkens him
[SHK] I could do more to do Antonius good
[SHK] But 'twould offend him and in his offence
[SHK] Should my performance perish
[SHK] Thou hast Ventidius
[SHK] that
[SHK] Without the which a soldier and his sword
[SHK] Grants scarce distinction Thou wilt write to Antony
[SHK] I 'll humbly signify what in his name
[SHK] That magical word of war we have effected
[SHK] How with his banners and his well-paid ranks
[SHK] The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
[SHK] We have jaded out o the field

[SHK] We shall appear before him On there pass along
[SHK] What are the brothers parted
[SHK] They have dispatch 'd with Pompey he is gone
[SHK] The other three are sealing Octavia weeps
[SHK] To part from Rome Caesar is sad and Lepidus
[SHK] Since Pompey 's feast as Menas says is troubled
[SHK] With the green sickness
[SHK] 'T is a noble Lepidus
[SHK] A very fine one O how he loves Caesar
[SHK] Nay but how dearly he adores Mark Antony
[SHK] Caesar Why he 's the Jupiter of men
[SHK] What 's Antony The god of Jupiter
[SHK] Spake you of Caesar How the non-pareil
[SHK] O Antony O thou Arabian bird
[SHK] Would you praise Caesar say 'Caesar go no further
[SHK] Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises
[SHK] But he loves Caesar best yet he loves Antony
[SHK] Ho hearts tongues figures scribes bards
[SHK] poets can not
[SHK] Think speak cast write sing number ho
[SHK] His love to Antony But as for Caesar
[SHK] Kneel down kneel down and wonder
[SHK] Both he loves
[SHK] They are his shards and he their beetle
[SHK] So
[SHK] This is to horse Adieu noble Agrippa
[SHK] Good fortune worthy soldier and farewell
[SHK] No further sir
[SHK] You take from me a great part of myself
[SHK] Use me well in 't Sister prove such a wife
[SHK] As my thoughts make thee and as my farthest band
[SHK] Shall pass on thy approof Most noble Antony
[SHK] Let not the piece of virtue which is set
[SHK] Betwixt us as the cement of our love
[SHK] To keep it builded be the ram to batter
[SHK] The fortress of it for better might we
[SHK] Have loved without this mean if on both parts
[SHK] This be not cherish 'd
[SHK] Make me not offended
[SHK] In your distrust
[SHK] I have said
[SHK] You shall not find
[SHK] Though you be therein curious the least cause
[SHK] For what you seem to fear so the gods keep you
[SHK] And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends
[SHK] We will here part
[SHK] Farewell my dearest sister fare thee well
[SHK] The elements be kind to thee and make
[SHK] Thy spirits all of comfort fare thee well
[SHK] My noble brother
[SHK] The April 's in her eyes it is love 's spring
[SHK] And these the showers to bring it on Be cheerful
[SHK] Sir look well to my husband 's house and --
[SHK] What Octavia
[SHK] I 'll tell you in your ear
[SHK] Her tongue will not obey her heart nor can
[SHK] Her heart inform her tongue -- the swan 's
[SHK] down-feather
[SHK] That stands upon the swell at full of tide
[SHK] And neither way inclines
[SHK] were he a horse
[SHK] So is he being a man
[SHK] When Antony found Julius Caesar dead
[SHK] He cried almost to roaring and he wept
[SHK] When at Philippi he found Brutus slain
[SHK] troubled with a rheum
[SHK] What willingly he did confound he wail 'd
[SHK] Believe't till I wept too
[SHK] No sweet Octavia
[SHK] You shall hear from me still the time shall not
[SHK] Out-go my thinking on you
[SHK] Come sir come
[SHK] I 'll wrestle with you in my strength of love
[SHK] Look here I have you thus I let you go
[SHK] And give you to the gods
[SHK] Adieu be happy
[SHK] Let all the number of the stars give light
[SHK] To thy fair way
[SHK] Farewell farewell
[SHK] Farewell
[SHK] Where is the fellow
[SHK] Half afeard to come
[SHK] Go to go to
[SHK] Come hither sir
[SHK] Good majesty
[SHK] Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
[SHK] But when you are well pleased
[SHK] That Herod 's head
[SHK] I 'll have but how when Antony is gone
[SHK] Through whom I might command it Come thou near
[SHK] Most gracious majesty --
[SHK] Didst thou behold Octavia
[SHK] Ay dread queen
[SHK] Where
[SHK] Madam in Rome
[SHK] I look 'd her in the face and saw her led
[SHK] Between her brother and Mark Antony
[SHK] Is she as tall as me
[SHK] She is not madam
[SHK] Didst hear her speak is she shrill-tongued or low
[SHK] Madam I heard her speak she is low-voiced
[SHK] That 's not so good he can not like her long
[SHK] Like her O Isis 't is impossible
[SHK] I think so Charmian dull of tongue and dwarfish
[SHK] What majesty is in her gait Remember
[SHK] If e'er thou look'dst on majesty
[SHK] She creeps
[SHK] Her motion and her station are as one
[SHK] She shows a body rather than a life
[SHK] A statue than a breather
[SHK] Is this certain
[SHK] Or I have no observance
[SHK] Three in Egypt
[SHK] Can not make better note
[SHK] He 's very knowing
[SHK] I do perceive't there 's nothing in her yet
[SHK] The fellow has good judgment
[SHK] Excellent
[SHK] Guess at her years I prithee
[SHK] Madam
[SHK] She was a widow --
[SHK] Widow Charmian hark
[SHK] And I do think she 's thirty
[SHK] Bear'st thou her face in mind is't long or round
[SHK] Round even to faultiness
[SHK] For the most part too they are foolish that are so
[SHK] Her hair what colour
[SHK] Brown madam and her forehead
[SHK] As low as she would wish it
[SHK] There 's gold for thee
[SHK] Thou must not take my former sharpness ill
[SHK] I will employ thee back again I find thee
[SHK] Most fit for business go make thee ready
[SHK] Our letters are prepared
[SHK] A proper man
[SHK] Indeed he is so I repent me much
[SHK] That so I harried him Why methinks by him
[SHK] This creature 's no such thing
[SHK] Nothing madam
[SHK] The man hath seen some majesty and should know
[SHK] Hath he seen majesty Isis else defend
[SHK] And serving you so long
[SHK] I have one thing more to ask him yet good Charmian
[SHK] But 't is no matter thou shalt bring him to me
[SHK] Where I will write All may be well enough
[SHK] I warrant you madam
[SHK] Nay nay Octavia not only that --
[SHK] That were excusable that and thousands more
[SHK] Of semblable import -- but he hath waged
[SHK] New wars 'gainst Pompey made his will and read it
[SHK] To public ear
[SHK] Spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not
[SHK] But pay me terms of honour cold and sickly
[SHK] He vented them most narrow measure lent me
[SHK] When the best hint was given him he not took't
[SHK] Or did it from his teeth
[SHK] O my good lord
[SHK] Believe not all or if you must believe
[SHK] Stomach not all A more unhappy lady
[SHK] If this division chance ne'er stood between
[SHK] Praying for both parts
[SHK] The good gods me presently
[SHK] When I shall pray O bless my lord and husband
[SHK] Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
[SHK] O bless my brother Husband win win brother
[SHK] Prays and destroys the prayer no midway
[SHK] 'Twixt these extremes at all
[SHK] Gentle Octavia
[SHK] Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
[SHK] Best to preserve it if I lose mine honour
[SHK] I lose myself better I were not yours
[SHK] Than yours so branchless But as you requested
[SHK] Yourself shall go between 's the mean time lady
[SHK] I 'll raise the preparation of a war
[SHK] Shall stain your brother make your soonest haste
[SHK] So your desires are yours
[SHK] Thanks to my lord
[SHK] The Jove of power make me most weak most weak
[SHK] Your reconciler Wars 'twixt you twain would be
[SHK] As if the world should cleave and that slain men
[SHK] Should solder up the rift
[SHK] When it appears to you where this begins
[SHK] Turn your displeasure that way for our faults
[SHK] Can never be so equal that your love
[SHK] Can equally move with them Provide your going
[SHK] Choose your own company and command what cost
[SHK] Your heart has mind to
[SHK] How now friend Eros
[SHK] There 's strange news come sir
[SHK] What man

[SHK] him partake in the glory of the action and not
[SHK] resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly
[SHK] wrote to Pompey upon his own appeal seizes him so
[SHK] the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine
[SHK] Then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more
[SHK] And throw between them all the food thou hast
[SHK] They 'll grind the one the other Where 's Antony
[SHK] He 's walking in the garden -- thus and spurns
[SHK] The rush that lies before him cries 'Fool Lepidus
[SHK] And threats the throat of that his officer
[SHK] That murder 'd Pompey
[SHK] Our great navy 's rigg 'd
[SHK] For Italy and Caesar More Domitius
[SHK] My lord desires you presently my news

[SHK] Sextus Pompeius spoil 'd we had not rated him
[SHK] His part o the isle then does he say he lent me
[SHK] Some shipping unrestored lastly he frets
[SHK] That Lepidus of the triumvirate
[SHK] Should be deposed and being that we detain
[SHK] All his revenue
[SHK] Sir this should be answer 'd
[SHK] 'T is done already and the messenger gone
[SHK] I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel
[SHK] That he his high authority abused
[SHK] And did deserve his change for what I have conquer 'd
[SHK] I grant him part but then in his Armenia
[SHK] And other of his conquer 'd kingdoms I
[SHK] Demand the like

[SHK] Longing for what it had not nay the dust
[SHK] Should have ascended to the roof of heaven
[SHK] Raised by your populous troops but you are come
[SHK] A market-maid to Rome and have prevented
[SHK] The ostentation of our love which left unshown
[SHK] Is often left unloved we should have met you
[SHK] By sea and land supplying every stage
[SHK] With an augmented greeting
[SHK] Good my lord
[SHK] To come thus was I not constrain 'd but did
[SHK] On my free will My lord Mark Antony
[SHK] Hearing that you prepared for war acquainted
[SHK] My grieved ear withal whereon I begg 'd
[SHK] His pardon for return
[SHK] Which soon he granted
[SHK] Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him

[SHK] Till we perceived both how you were wrong led
[SHK] And we in negligent danger Cheer your heart

[SHK] O'er your content these strong necessities
[SHK] But let determined things to destiny
[SHK] Hold unbewail 'd their way Welcome to Rome
[SHK] Nothing more dear to me You are abused
[SHK] Beyond the mark of thought and the high gods
[SHK] To do you justice make them ministers
[SHK] Of us and those that love you Best of comfort
[SHK] And ever welcome to us
[SHK] Welcome lady
[SHK] Welcome dear madam
[SHK] Each heart in Rome does love and pity you
[SHK] Only the adulterous Antony most large
[SHK] In his abominations turns you off
[SHK] And gives his potent regiment to a trull
[SHK] That noises it against us
[SHK] Is it so sir
[SHK] Most certain Sister welcome pray you
[SHK] Be ever known to patience my dear'st sister
[SHK] I will be even with thee doubt it not
[SHK] But why why why
[SHK] Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars
[SHK] And say'st it is not fit
[SHK] Well is it is it
[SHK] If not denounced against us why should not we
[SHK] Be there in person
[SHK] If we should serve with horse and mares together
[SHK] The horse were merely lost the mares would bear
[SHK] A soldier and his horse
[SHK] What is't you say
[SHK] Your presence needs must puzzle Antony
[SHK] Take from his heart take from his brain
[SHK] from 's time
[SHK] What should not then be spared He is already
[SHK] Traduced for levity and 't is said in Rome
[SHK] That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
[SHK] Manage this war
[SHK] Sink Rome and their tongues rot
[SHK] That speak against us A charge we bear i the war
[SHK] And as the president of my kingdom will
[SHK] Appear there for a man Speak not against it
[SHK] I will not stay behind
[SHK] Nay I have done
[SHK] Here comes the emperor
[SHK] Is it not strange Canidius
[SHK] That from Tarentum and Brundusium
[SHK] He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea
[SHK] And take in Toryne You have heard o n't sweet
[SHK] Celerity is never more admired
[SHK] Than by the negligent
[SHK] A good rebuke
[SHK] Which might have well becomed the best of men
[SHK] To taunt at slackness Canidius we
[SHK] Will fight with him by sea
[SHK] By sea what else
[SHK] Why will my lord do so
[SHK] For that he dares us to't
[SHK] So hath my lord dared him to single fight
[SHK] Ay and to wage this battle at Pharsalia
[SHK] Where Caesar fought with Pompey but these offers
[SHK] Which serve not for his vantage be shakes off
[SHK] And so should you
[SHK] Your ships are not well mann 'd
[SHK] Your mariners are muleters reapers people
[SHK] Ingross 'd by swift impress in Caesar 's fleet
[SHK] Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought
[SHK] Their ships are yare yours heavy no disgrace
[SHK] Shall fall you for refusing him at sea
[SHK] Being prepared for land
[SHK] By sea by sea
[SHK] Most worthy sir you therein throw away
[SHK] The absolute soldiership you have by land
[SHK] Distract your army which doth most consist
[SHK] Of war-mark 'd footmen leave unexecuted
[SHK] Your own renowned knowledge quite forego
[SHK] The way which promises assurance and
[SHK] Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
[SHK] From firm security
[SHK] I 'll fight at sea
[SHK] I have sixty sails Caesar none better
[SHK] Our overplus of shipping will we burn
[SHK] And with the rest full-mann 'd from the head of Actium
[SHK] Beat the approaching Caesar But if we fail
[SHK] We then can do't at land
[SHK] Thy business
[SHK] The news is true my lord he is descried
[SHK] Caesar has taken Toryne
[SHK] Can he be there in person 't is impossible
[SHK] Strange that power should be Canidius
[SHK] Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land
[SHK] And our twelve thousand horse We 'll to our ship
[SHK] Away my Thetis
[SHK] How now worthy soldier
[SHK] O noble emperor do not fight by sea
[SHK] Trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt
[SHK] This sword and these my wounds Let the Egyptians
[SHK] And the Phoenicians go a-ducking we
[SHK] Have used to conquer standing on the earth
[SHK] And fighting foot to foot
[SHK] Well well away
[SHK] By Hercules I think I am i the right
[SHK] Soldier thou art but his whole action grows
[SHK] Not in the power o n't so our leader 's led
[SHK] And we are women 's men
[SHK] You keep by land
[SHK] The legions and the horse whole do you not
[SHK] Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius
[SHK] Publicola and Caelius are for sea
[SHK] But we keep whole by land This speed of Caesar 's
[SHK] Carries beyond belief
[SHK] While he was yet in Rome
[SHK] His power went out in such distractions as
[SHK] Beguiled all spies
[SHK] Who 's his lieutenant hear you
[SHK] They say one Taurus
[SHK] Well I know the man
[SHK] The emperor calls Canidius
[SHK] With news the time 's with labour and throes forth
[SHK] Each minute some
[SHK] Taurus
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] Strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle
[SHK] Till we have done at sea Do not exceed
[SHK] The prescript of this scroll our fortune lies
[SHK] Upon this jump
[SHK] Set we our squadrons on yond side o the hill
[SHK] In eye of Caesar 's battle from which place
[SHK] We may the number of the ships behold
[SHK] And so proceed accordingly
[SHK] Naught naught all naught I can behold no longer
[SHK] The Antoniad the Egyptian admiral
[SHK] With all their sixty fly and turn the rudder
[SHK] To see't mine eyes are blasted
[SHK] Gods and goddesses
[SHK] All the whole synod of them
[SHK] What 's thy passion
[SHK] The greater cantle of the world is lost
[SHK] With very ignorance we have kiss 'd away
[SHK] Kingdoms and provinces
[SHK] How appears the fight
[SHK] On our side like the token 'd pestilence
[SHK] Where death is sure Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt --
[SHK] Whom leprosy o'ertake -- i the midst o the fight
[SHK] When vantage like a pair of twins appear 'd
[SHK] Both as the same or rather ours the elder
[SHK] The breese upon her like a cow in June
[SHK] Hoists sails and flies
[SHK] That I beheld
[SHK] Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
[SHK] Endure a further view
[SHK] She once being loof 'd
[SHK] The noble ruin of her magic Antony
[SHK] Claps on his sea-wing and like a doting mallard
[SHK] Leaving the fight in height flies after her
[SHK] I never saw an action of such shame
[SHK] Experience manhood honour ne'er before
[SHK] Did violate so itself
[SHK] Alack alack
[SHK] Our fortune on the sea is out of breath
[SHK] And sinks most lamentably Had our general
[SHK] Been what he knew himself it had gone well
[SHK] O he has given example for our flight
[SHK] Most grossly by his own
[SHK] Ay are you thereabouts
[SHK] Why then good night indeed
[SHK] Toward Peloponnesus are they fled
[SHK] 'T is easy to't and there I will attend
[SHK] What further comes
[SHK] To Caesar will I render
[SHK] My legions and my horse six kings already
[SHK] Show me the way of yielding
[SHK] I 'll yet follow
[SHK] The wounded chance of Antony though my reason
[SHK] Sits in the wind against me
[SHK] Hark the land bids me tread no more upo n't
[SHK] It is ashamed to bear me Friends come hither
[SHK] I am so lated in the world that I
[SHK] Have lost my way for ever I have a ship
[SHK] Laden with gold take that divide it fly
[SHK] And make your peace with Caesar
[SHK] Fly not we
[SHK] I have fled myself and have instructed cowards
[SHK] To run and show their shoulders Friends be gone
[SHK] I have myself resolved upon a course
[SHK] Which has no need of you be gone
[SHK] My treasure 's in the harbour take it O
[SHK] I follow 'd that I blush to look upon
[SHK] My very hairs do mutiny for the white
[SHK] Reprove the brown for rashness and they them
[SHK] For fear and doting Friends be gone you shall
[SHK] Have letters from me to some friends that will
[SHK] Sweep your way for you Pray you look not sad
[SHK] Nor make replies of loathness take the hint
[SHK] Which my despair proclaims let that be left
[SHK] Which leaves itself to the sea-side straightway
[SHK] I will possess you of that ship and treasure
[SHK] Leave me I pray a little pray you now
[SHK] Nay do so for indeed I have lost command
[SHK] Therefore I pray you I 'll see you by and by
[SHK] Nay gentle madam to him comfort him
[SHK] Do most dear queen
[SHK] Do why what else
[SHK] Let me sit down O Juno
[SHK] No no no no no
[SHK] See you here sir
[SHK] O fie fie fie
[SHK] Madam
[SHK] Madam O good empress
[SHK] Sir sir --
[SHK] Yes my lord yes he at Philippi kept
[SHK] His sword e'en like a dancer while I struck
[SHK] The lean and wrinkled Cassius and 't was I
[SHK] That the mad Brutus ended he alone
[SHK] Dealt on lieutenantry and no practise had
[SHK] In the brave squares of war yet now -- No matter
[SHK] Ah stand by
[SHK] The queen my lord the queen
[SHK] Go to him madam speak to him
[SHK] He is unqualitied with very shame
[SHK] Well then sustain him O
[SHK] Most noble sir arise the queen approaches
[SHK] Her head 's declined and death will seize her but
[SHK] Your comfort makes the rescue
[SHK] I have offended reputation
[SHK] A most unnoble swerving
[SHK] Sir the queen
[SHK] O whither hast thou led me Egypt See
[SHK] How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
[SHK] By looking back what I have left behind
[SHK] 'Stroy 'd in dishonour
[SHK] O my lord my lord
[SHK] Forgive my fearful sails I little thought
[SHK] You would have follow 'd
[SHK] Egypt thou knew'st too well
[SHK] My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings
[SHK] And thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit
[SHK] Thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that
[SHK] Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
[SHK] Command me
[SHK] O my pardon
[SHK] Now I must
[SHK] To the young man send humble treaties dodge
[SHK] And palter in the shifts of lowness who
[SHK] With half the bulk o the world play 'd as I pleased
[SHK] Making and marring fortunes You did know
[SHK] How much you were my conqueror and that
[SHK] My sword made weak by my affection would
[SHK] Obey it on all cause
[SHK] Pardon pardon
[SHK] Fall not a tear I say one of them rates
[SHK] All that is won and lost give me a kiss
[SHK] Even this repays me We sent our schoolmaster
[SHK] Is he come back Love I am full of lead
[SHK] Some wine within there and our viands Fortune knows
[SHK] We scorn her most when most she offers blows
[SHK] Let him appear that 's come from Antony
[SHK] Know you him
[SHK] Caesar 't is his schoolmaster
[SHK] An argument that he is pluck 'd when hither
[SHK] He sends so poor a pinion off his wing
[SHK] Which had superfluous kings for messengers
[SHK] Not many moons gone by
[SHK] Approach and speak
[SHK] Such as I am I come from Antony
[SHK] I was of late as petty to his ends
[SHK] As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
[SHK] To his grand sea
[SHK] Be't so declare thine office
[SHK] Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and
[SHK] Requires to live in Egypt which not granted
[SHK] He lessens his requests and to thee sues
[SHK] To let him breathe between the heavens and earth
[SHK] A private man in Athens this for him
[SHK] Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness
[SHK] Submits her to thy might and of thee craves
[SHK] The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs
[SHK] Now hazarded to thy grace
[SHK] For Antony
[SHK] I have no ears to his request The queen
[SHK] Of audience nor desire shall fail so she
[SHK] From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend
[SHK] Or take his life there this if she perform
[SHK] She shall not sue unheard So to them both
[SHK] Fortune pursue thee
[SHK] Bring him through the bands
[SHK] From Antony win Cleopatra promise
[SHK] And in our name what she requires add more
[SHK] From thine invention offers women are not
[SHK] In their best fortunes strong but want will perjure
[SHK] The ne'er touch 'd vestal try thy cunning Thyreus
[SHK] Make thine own edict for thy pains which we
[SHK] Will answer as a law
[SHK] Caesar I go
[SHK] Observe how Antony becomes his flaw
[SHK] And what thou think'st his very action speaks
[SHK] In every power that moves
[SHK] Caesar I shall
[SHK] What shall we do Enobarbus
[SHK] Think and die
[SHK] Is Antony or we in fault for this
[SHK] Antony only that would make his will
[SHK] Lord of his reason What though you fled
[SHK] From that great face of war whose several ranges
[SHK] Frighted each other why should he follow
[SHK] The itch of his affection should not then
[SHK] Have nick 'd his captainship at such a point
[SHK] When half to half the world opposed he being
[SHK] The meered question 't was a shame no less
[SHK] Than was his loss to course your flying flags
[SHK] And leave his navy gazing
[SHK] Prithee peace
[SHK] Is that his answer
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] The queen shall then have courtesy so she
[SHK] Will yield us up
[SHK] He says so
[SHK] Let her know't
[SHK] To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head
[SHK] And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
[SHK] With principalities
[SHK] That head my lord
[SHK] To him again tell him he wears the rose
[SHK] Of youth upon him from which the world should note
[SHK] Something particular his coin ships legions
[SHK] May be a coward 's whose ministers would prevail
[SHK] Under the service of a child as soon
[SHK] As i the command of Caesar I dare him therefore
[SHK] To lay his gay comparisons apart
[SHK] And answer me declined sword against sword
[SHK] Ourselves alone I 'll write it follow me
[SHK] Unstate his happiness and be staged to the show
[SHK] Against a sworder I see men 's judgments are
[SHK] A parcel of their fortunes and things outward
[SHK] Do draw the inward quality after them
[SHK] To suffer all alike That he should dream
[SHK] Knowing all measures the full Caesar will
[SHK] Answer his emptiness Caesar thou hast subdued
[SHK] His judgment too
[SHK] A messenger from CAESAR
[SHK] What no more ceremony See my women
[SHK] Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
[SHK] That kneel 'd unto the buds Admit him sir
[SHK] The loyalty well held to fools does make
[SHK] Our faith mere folly yet he that can endure
[SHK] To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
[SHK] Does conquer him that did his master conquer
[SHK] And earns a place i the story
[SHK] Caesar 's will
[SHK] Hear it apart
[SHK] None but friends say boldly
[SHK] So haply are they friends to Antony
[SHK] He needs as many sir as Caesar has
[SHK] Or needs not us If Caesar please our master
[SHK] Will leap to be his friend for us you know
[SHK] Whose he is we are and that is Caesar 's
[SHK] So
[SHK] Thus then thou most renown 'd Caesar entreats
[SHK] Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
[SHK] Further than he is Caesar
[SHK] Go on right royal
[SHK] He knows that you embrace not Antony
[SHK] As you did love but as you fear 'd him
[SHK] O
[SHK] The scars upon your honour therefore he
[SHK] Does pity as constrained blemishes
[SHK] Not as deserved
[SHK] He is a god and knows
[SHK] What is most right mine honour was not yielded
[SHK] But conquer 'd merely
[SHK] I will ask Antony Sir sir thou art so leaky
[SHK] That we must leave thee to thy sinking for
[SHK] Thy dearest quit thee
[SHK] Shall I say to Caesar
[SHK] What you require of him for he partly begs
[SHK] To be desired to give It much would please him
[SHK] That of his fortunes you should make a staff
[SHK] To lean upon but it would warm his spirits
[SHK] To hear from me you had left Antony
[SHK] And put yourself under his shrowd
[SHK] The universal landlord
[SHK] What 's your name
[SHK] My name is Thyreus
[SHK] Most kind messenger
[SHK] Say to great Caesar this in deputation
[SHK] I kiss his conquering hand tell him I am prompt
[SHK] To lay my crown at 's feet and there to kneel
[SHK] Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
[SHK] The doom of Egypt
[SHK] 'T is your noblest course
[SHK] Wisdom and fortune combating together
[SHK] If that the former dare but what it can
[SHK] No chance may shake it Give me grace to lay
[SHK] My duty on your hand
[SHK] Your Caesar 's father oft
[SHK] When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in
[SHK] Bestow 'd his lips on that unworthy place
[SHK] As it rain 'd kisses
[SHK] Favours by Jove that thunders
[SHK] What art thou fellow
[SHK] One that but performs
[SHK] The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest
[SHK] To have command obey 'd
[SHK] Approach there Ah you kite Now gods
[SHK] and devils
[SHK] Authority melts from me of late when I cried 'Ho
[SHK] Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth
[SHK] And cry 'Your will Have you no ears I am
[SHK] Antony yet
[SHK] Take hence this Jack and whip him
[SHK] Than with an old one dying
[SHK] Moon and stars
[SHK] Whip him Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
[SHK] That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them
[SHK] So saucy with the hand of she here -- what 's her name
[SHK] Since she was Cleopatra Whip him fellows
[SHK] Till like a boy you see him cringe his face
[SHK] And whine aloud for mercy take him hence
[SHK] Mark Antony
[SHK] Tug him away being whipp 'd
[SHK] Bring him again this Jack of Caesar 's shall
[SHK] Bear us an errand to him
[SHK] You were half blasted ere I knew you ha
[SHK] Have I my pillow left unpress 'd in Rome
[SHK] Forborne the getting of a lawful race
[SHK] And by a gem of women to be abused
[SHK] By one that looks on feeders
[SHK] Good my lord --
[SHK] You have been a boggler ever
[SHK] But when we in our viciousness grow hard --
[SHK] O misery o n't -- the wise gods seel our eyes
[SHK] In our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
[SHK] Adore our errors laugh at 's while we strut
[SHK] To our confusion
[SHK] O is't come to this
[SHK] I found you as a morsel cold upon
[SHK] Dead Caesar 's trencher nay you were a fragment
[SHK] Of Cneius Pompey 's besides what hotter hours
[SHK] Unregister 'd in vulgar fame you have
[SHK] Luxuriously pick 'd out for I am sure
[SHK] Though you can guess what temperance should be
[SHK] You know not what it is
[SHK] Wherefore is this
[SHK] To let a fellow that will take rewards
[SHK] And say 'God quit you be familiar with
[SHK] My playfellow your hand this kingly seal
[SHK] And plighter of high hearts O that I were
[SHK] Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
[SHK] The horned herd for I have savage cause
[SHK] And to proclaim it civilly were like
[SHK] A halter 'd neck which does the hangman thank
[SHK] For being yare about him
[SHK] Is he whipp 'd
[SHK] Soundly my lord
[SHK] Cried he and begg 'd a pardon
[SHK] He did ask favour
[SHK] If that thy father live let him repent
[SHK] Thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
[SHK] To follow Caesar in his triumph since
[SHK] Thou hast been whipp 'd for following him henceforth
[SHK] The white hand of a lady fever thee
[SHK] Shake thou to look on 't Get thee back to Caesar
[SHK] Tell him thy entertainment look thou say
[SHK] He makes me angry with him for he seems
[SHK] Proud and disdainful harping on what I am
[SHK] Not what he knew I was he makes me angry
[SHK] And at this time most easy 't is to do't
[SHK] When my good stars that were my former guides
[SHK] Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
[SHK] Into the abysm of hell If he mislike
[SHK] My speech and what is done tell him he has
[SHK] Hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
[SHK] He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
[SHK] As he shall like to quit me urge it thou
[SHK] Hence with thy stripes begone
[SHK] Have you done yet
[SHK] Alack our terrene moon
[SHK] Is now eclipsed and it portends alone
[SHK] The fall of Antony
[SHK] I must stay his time
[SHK] To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes
[SHK] With one that ties his points
[SHK] Not know me yet
[SHK] Cold-hearted toward me
[SHK] Ah dear if I be so
[SHK] From my cold heart let heaven engender hail
[SHK] And poison it in the source and the first stone
[SHK] Drop in my neck as it determines so
[SHK] Dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite
[SHK] Till by degrees the memory of my womb
[SHK] Together with my brave Egyptians all
[SHK] By the discandying of this pelleted storm
[SHK] Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile
[SHK] Have buried them for prey
[SHK] I am satisfied
[SHK] Caesar sits down in Alexandria where
[SHK] I will oppose his fate Our force by land
[SHK] Hath nobly held our sever 'd navy too
[SHK] Have knit again and fleet threatening most sea-like
[SHK] Where hast thou been my heart Dost thou hear lady
[SHK] If from the field I shall return once more
[SHK] To kiss these lips I will appear in blood
[SHK] I and my sword will earn our chronicle
[SHK] There 's hope i n't yet
[SHK] That 's my brave lord
[SHK] I will be treble-sinew 'd hearted breathed
[SHK] And fight maliciously for when mine hours
[SHK] Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives
[SHK] Of me for jests but now I 'll set my teeth
[SHK] And send to darkness all that stop me Come
[SHK] Let 's have one other gaudy night call to me
[SHK] All my sad captains fill our bowls once more
[SHK] Let 's mock the midnight bell
[SHK] It is my birth-day
[SHK] I had thought to have held it poor but since my lord
[SHK] Is Antony again I will be Cleopatra
[SHK] We will yet do well
[SHK] Call all his noble captains to my lord
[SHK] Do so we 'll speak to them and to-night I 'll force
[SHK] The wine peep through their scars Come on my queen
[SHK] There 's sap i n't yet The next time I do fight
[SHK] I 'll make death love me for I will contend
[SHK] Even with his pestilent scythe
[SHK] Now he 'll outstare the lightning To be furious
[SHK] Is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood
[SHK] The dove will peck the estridge and I see still
[SHK] A diminution in our captain 's brain
[SHK] Restores his heart when valour preys on reason
[SHK] It eats the sword it fights with I will seek
[SHK] Some way to leave him
[SHK] He calls me boy and chides as he had power
[SHK] To beat me out of Egypt my messenger
[SHK] He hath whipp 'd with rods dares me to personal combat
[SHK] Caesar to Antony let the old ruffian know
[SHK] I have many other ways to die meantime
[SHK] Laugh at his challenge
[SHK] Caesar must think
[SHK] When one so great begins to rage he 's hunted
[SHK] Even to falling Give him no breath but now
[SHK] Make boot of his distraction never anger
[SHK] Made good guard for itself
[SHK] Let our best heads
[SHK] Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
[SHK] We mean to fight within our files there are
[SHK] Of those that served Mark Antony but late
[SHK] Enough to fetch him in See it done
[SHK] And feast the army we have store to do't
[SHK] And they have earn 'd the waste Poor Antony
[SHK] He will not fight with me Domitius
[SHK] No
[SHK] Why should he not
[SHK] He thinks being twenty times of better fortune
[SHK] He is twenty men to one
[SHK] To-morrow soldier
[SHK] By sea and land I 'll fight or I will live
[SHK] Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
[SHK] Shall make it live again Woo't thou fight well
[SHK] I 'll strike and cry 'Take all
[SHK] Well said come on
[SHK] Call forth my household servants let 's to-night
[SHK] Be bounteous at our meal
[SHK] Give me thy hand
[SHK] Thou hast been rightly honest -- so hast thou --
[SHK] Thou -- and thou -- and thou -- you have served me well
[SHK] And kings have been your fellows
[SHK] tricks which sorrow shoots
[SHK] Out of the mind
[SHK] And thou art honest too
[SHK] I wish I could be made so many men
[SHK] And all of you clapp 'd up together in
[SHK] An Antony that I might do you service
[SHK] So good as you have done
[SHK] The gods forbid
[SHK] Well my good fellows wait on me to-night
[SHK] Scant not my cups and make as much of me
[SHK] As when mine empire was your fellow too
[SHK] And suffer 'd my command
[SHK] Tend me to-night
[SHK] May be it is the period of your duty
[SHK] Haply you shall not see me more or if
[SHK] A mangled shadow perchance to-morrow
[SHK] You 'll serve another master I look on you
[SHK] As one that takes his leave Mine honest friends
[SHK] I turn you not away but like a master
[SHK] Married to your good service stay till death
[SHK] Tend me to-night two hours I ask no more
[SHK] And the gods yield you for't
[SHK] What mean you sir
[SHK] To give them this discomfort Look they weep
[SHK] And I an ass am onion-eyed for shame
[SHK] Transform us not to women
[SHK] Ho ho ho
[SHK] Now the witch take me if I meant it thus
[SHK] Grace grow where those drops fall
[SHK] My hearty friends
[SHK] You take me in too dolorous a sense
[SHK] For I spake to you for your comfort did desire you
[SHK] To burn this night with torches know my hearts
[SHK] I hope well of to-morrow and will lead you
[SHK] Where rather I 'll expect victorious life
[SHK] Than death and honour Let 's to supper come
[SHK] And drown consideration
[SHK] Brother good night to-morrow is the day
[SHK] It will determine one way fare you well
[SHK] Heard you of nothing strange about the streets
[SHK] Nothing What news

[SHK] Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail 'd
[SHK] To make me fight at land
[SHK] Hadst thou done so

[SHK] Go forth Agrippa and begin the fight
[SHK] Our will is Antony be took alive
[SHK] Make it so known
[SHK] Caesar I shall
[SHK] The time of universal peace is near
[SHK] Prove this a prosperous day the three-nook 'd world
[SHK] Shall bear the olive freely
[SHK] Antony
[SHK] Is come into the field
[SHK] Go charge Agrippa
[SHK] Plant those that have revolted in the van
[SHK] That Antony may seem to spend his fury
[SHK] Upon himself
[SHK] Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
[SHK] Affairs of Antony there did persuade
[SHK] Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
[SHK] And leave his master Antony for this pains
[SHK] Caesar hath hang 'd him Canidius and the rest
[SHK] That fell away have entertainment but
[SHK] No honourable trust I have done ill
[SHK] Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
[SHK] That I will joy no more
[SHK] Enobarbus Antony
[SHK] Hath after thee sent all thy treasure with
[SHK] His bounty overplus the messenger
[SHK] Came on my guard and at thy tent is now
[SHK] Unloading of his mules
[SHK] I give it you
[SHK] Mock not Enobarbus
[SHK] I tell you true best you safed the bringer
[SHK] Out of the host I must attend mine office
[SHK] Or would have done't myself Your emperor
[SHK] Continues still a Jove
[SHK] I am alone the villain of the earth
[SHK] And feel I am so most O Antony
[SHK] Thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid
[SHK] My better service when my turpitude
[SHK] Thou dost so crown with gold This blows my heart
[SHK] If swift thought break it not a swifter mean
[SHK] Shall outstrike thought but thought will do't I feel
[SHK] I fight against thee No I will go seek
[SHK] Some ditch wherein to die the foul'st best fits
[SHK] My latter part of life
[SHK] Retire we have engaged ourselves too far
[SHK] Caesar himself has work and our oppression
[SHK] Exceeds what we expected
[SHK] O my brave emperor this is fought indeed
[SHK] Had we done so at first we had droven them home
[SHK] With clouts about their heads
[SHK] Thou bleed'st apace
[SHK] I had a wound here that was like a T
[SHK] But now 't is made an H
[SHK] They do retire
[SHK] We 'll beat 'em into bench-holes I have yet
[SHK] Room for six scotches more
[SHK] They are beaten sir and our advantage serves
[SHK] For a fair victory
[SHK] Let us score their backs
[SHK] And snatch 'em up as we take hares behind
[SHK] 'T is sport to maul a runner

[SHK] Once for thy spritely comfort and ten-fold
[SHK] For thy good valour Come thee on
[SHK] I 'll halt after

[SHK] And let the queen know of our gests To-morrow
[SHK] Before the sun shall see 's we 'll spill the blood
[SHK] That has to-day escaped I thank you all

[SHK] Each man 's like mine you have shown all Hectors

[SHK] Tell them your feats whilst they with joyful tears
[SHK] Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
[SHK] The honour 'd gashes whole
[SHK] Give me thy hand
[SHK] To this great fairy I 'll commend thy acts
[SHK] Make her thanks bless thee
[SHK] O thou day o the world
[SHK] Chain mine arm 'd neck leap thou attire and all
[SHK] Through proof of harness to my heart and there
[SHK] Ride on the pants triumphing
[SHK] Lord of lords
[SHK] O infinite virtue comest thou smiling from
[SHK] The world 's great snare uncaught
[SHK] My nightingale
[SHK] We have beat them to their beds What girl
[SHK] though grey
[SHK] Do something mingle with our younger brown yet ha we
[SHK] A brain that nourishes our nerves and can
[SHK] Get goal for goal of youth Behold this man
[SHK] Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand
[SHK] Kiss it my warrior he hath fought to-day
[SHK] As if a god in hate of mankind had
[SHK] Destroy 'd in such a shape
[SHK] I 'll give thee friend
[SHK] An armour all of gold it was a king 's
[SHK] He has deserved it were it carbuncled
[SHK] Like holy Phoebus car Give me thy hand
[SHK] Through Alexandria make a jolly march
[SHK] Bear our hack 'd targets like the men that owe them
[SHK] Had our great palace the capacity
[SHK] To camp this host we all would sup together
[SHK] And drink carouses to the next day 's fate
[SHK] Which promises royal peril Trumpeters
[SHK] With brazen din blast you the city 's ear
[SHK] Make mingle with rattling tabourines
[SHK] That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
[SHK] Applauding our approach
[SHK] If we be not relieved within this hour
[SHK] We must return to the court of guard the night
[SHK] Is shiny and they say we shall embattle
[SHK] By the second hour i the morn
[SHK] This last day was
[SHK] A shrewd one to 's
[SHK] O bear me witness night --
[SHK] What man is this
[SHK] Stand close and list him
[SHK] Be witness to me O thou blessed moon
[SHK] When men revolted shall upon record
[SHK] Bear hateful memory poor Enobarbus did
[SHK] Before thy face repent
[SHK] Enobarbus
[SHK] Peace
[SHK] Hark further
[SHK] O sovereign mistress of true melancholy
[SHK] The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me
[SHK] That life a very rebel to my will
[SHK] May hang no longer on me throw my heart
[SHK] Against the flint and hardness of my fault
[SHK] Which being dried with grief will break to powder
[SHK] And finish all foul thoughts O Antony
[SHK] Nobler than my revolt is infamous
[SHK] Forgive me in thine own particular
[SHK] But let the world rank me in register
[SHK] A master-leaver and a fugitive
[SHK] O Antony O Antony
[SHK] Let 's speak To him
[SHK] Let 's hear him for the things he speaks
[SHK] May concern Caesar
[SHK] Let 's do so But he sleeps
[SHK] Swoons rather for so bad a prayer as his
[SHK] Was never yet for sleep
[SHK] Go we to him
[SHK] Awake sir awake speak to us
[SHK] Hear you sir
[SHK] The hand of death hath raught him
[SHK] Hark the drums
[SHK] Demurely wake the sleepers Let us bear him
[SHK] To the court of guard he is of note our hour
[SHK] Is fully out
[SHK] Come on then
[SHK] He may recover yet
[SHK] Their preparation is to-day by sea
[SHK] We please them not by land
[SHK] For both my lord
[SHK] I would they'ld fight i the fire or i the air
[SHK] We'ld fight there too But this it is our foot
[SHK] Upon the hills adjoining to the city
[SHK] Shall stay with us order for sea is given
[SHK] They have put forth the haven
[SHK] Where their appointment we may best discover
[SHK] And look on their endeavour
[SHK] But being charged we will be still by land
[SHK] Which as I take't we shall for his best force
[SHK] Is forth to man his galleys To the vales
[SHK] And hold our best advantage
[SHK] Yet they are not join 'd where yond pine
[SHK] does stand
[SHK] I shall discover all I 'll bring thee word
[SHK] Straight how 't is like to go
[SHK] Swallows have built
[SHK] In Cleopatra 's sails their nests the augurers
[SHK] Say they know not they can not tell look grimly
[SHK] And dare not speak their knowledge Antony
[SHK] Is valiant and dejected and by starts
[SHK] His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
[SHK] Of what he has and has not
[SHK] All is lost
[SHK] This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me
[SHK] My fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder
[SHK] They cast their caps up and carouse together
[SHK] Like friends long lost Triple-turn 'd whore
[SHK] 't is thou
[SHK] Hast sold me to this novice and my heart
[SHK] Makes only wars on thee Bid them all fly
[SHK] For when I am revenged upon my charm
[SHK] I have done all Bid them all fly begone
[SHK] O sun thy uprise shall I see no more
[SHK] Fortune and Antony part here even here
[SHK] Do we shake hands All come to this The hearts
[SHK] That spaniel 'd me at heels to whom I gave
[SHK] Their wishes do discandy melt their sweets
[SHK] On blossoming Caesar and this pine is bark 'd
[SHK] That overtopp 'd them all Betray 'd I am
[SHK] O this false soul of Egypt this grave charm --
[SHK] Whose eye beck 'd forth my wars and call 'd them home
[SHK] Whose bosom was my crownet my chief end --
[SHK] Like a right gipsy hath at fast and loose
[SHK] Beguiled me to the very heart of loss
[SHK] What Eros Eros
[SHK] Ah thou spell Avaunt
[SHK] Why is my lord enraged against his love
[SHK] Vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving
[SHK] And blemish Caesar 's triumph Let him take thee
[SHK] And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians
[SHK] Follow his chariot like the greatest spot
[SHK] Of all thy sex most monster-like be shown
[SHK] For poor'st diminutives for doits and let
[SHK] Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
[SHK] With her prepared nails
[SHK] 'T is well thou'rt gone
[SHK] If it be well to live but better 'twere
[SHK] Thou fell'st into my fury for one death
[SHK] Might have prevented many Eros ho
[SHK] The shirt of Nessus is upon me teach me
[SHK] Alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage
[SHK] Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o the moon
[SHK] And with those hands that grasp 'd the heaviest club
[SHK] Subdue my worthiest self The witch shall die
[SHK] To the young Roman boy she hath sold me and I fall
[SHK] Under this plot she dies for't Eros ho
[SHK] Help me my women O he is more mad
[SHK] Than Telamon for his shield the boar of Thessaly
[SHK] Was never so emboss 'd
[SHK] To the monument
[SHK] There lock yourself and send him word you are dead
[SHK] The soul and body rive not more in parting
[SHK] Than greatness going off
[SHK] To the monument
[SHK] Mardian go tell him I have slain myself
[SHK] Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony
[SHK] And word it prithee piteously hence Mardian
[SHK] And bring me how he takes my death
[SHK] To the monument
[SHK] Eros thou yet behold'st me
[SHK] Ay noble lord
[SHK] Sometimes we see a cloud that 's dragonish
[SHK] A vapour sometime like a bear or lion
[SHK] A tower 'd citadel a pendent rock
[SHK] A forked mountain or blue promontory
[SHK] With trees upo n't that nod unto the world
[SHK] And mock our eyes with air thou hast seen
[SHK] these signs
[SHK] They are black vesper 's pageants
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] That which is now a horse even with a thought
[SHK] The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct
[SHK] As water is in water
[SHK] It does my lord
[SHK] My good knave Eros now thy captain is
[SHK] Even such a body here I am Antony
[SHK] Yet can not hold this visible shape my knave
[SHK] I made these wars for Egypt and the queen --
[SHK] Whose heart I thought I had for she had mine
[SHK] Which whilst it was mine had annex 'd unto't
[SHK] A million more now lost -- she Eros has
[SHK] Pack 'd cards with Caesar and false-play 'd my glory
[SHK] Unto an enemy 's triumph
[SHK] Nay weep not gentle Eros there is left us
[SHK] Ourselves to end ourselves
[SHK] O thy vile lady
[SHK] She has robb 'd me of my sword
[SHK] No Antony
[SHK] My mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled
[SHK] With thine entirely
[SHK] Hence saucy eunuch peace
[SHK] She hath betray 'd me and shall die the death
[SHK] Death of one person can be paid but once
[SHK] And that she has discharged what thou wouldst do
[SHK] Is done unto thy hand the last she spake
[SHK] Was 'Antony most noble Antony
[SHK] Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
[SHK] The name of Antony it was divided
[SHK] Between her heart and lips she render 'd life
[SHK] Thy name so buried in her
[SHK] Dead then
[SHK] Dead
[SHK] Unarm Eros the long day 's task is done
[SHK] And we must sleep
[SHK] That thou depart'st hence safe
[SHK] Does pay thy labour richly go
[SHK] Off pluck off
[SHK] The seven-fold shield of Ajax can not keep
[SHK] The battery from my heart O cleave my sides
[SHK] Heart once be stronger than thy continent
[SHK] Crack thy frail case Apace Eros apace
[SHK] No more a soldier bruised pieces go
[SHK] You have been nobly borne From me awhile
[SHK] I will o'ertake thee Cleopatra and
[SHK] Weep for my pardon So it must be for now
[SHK] All length is torture since the torch is out
[SHK] Lie down and stray no farther now all labour
[SHK] Mars what it does yea very force entangles
[SHK] Itself with strength seal then and all is done
[SHK] Eros -- I come my queen -- Eros -- Stay for me
[SHK] Where souls do couch on flowers we 'll hand in hand
[SHK] And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze
[SHK] Dido and her AEneas shall want troops
[SHK] And all the haunt be ours Come Eros Eros
[SHK] What would my lord
[SHK] Since Cleopatra died
[SHK] I have lived in such dishonour that the gods
[SHK] Detest my baseness I that with my sword
[SHK] Quarter 'd the world and o'er green Neptune 's back
[SHK] With ships made cities condemn myself to lack
[SHK] The courage of a woman less noble mind
[SHK] Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
[SHK] I am conqueror of myself Thou art sworn Eros
[SHK] That when the exigent should come which now
[SHK] Is come indeed when I should see behind me
[SHK] The inevitable prosecution of
[SHK] Disgrace and horror that on my command
[SHK] Thou then wouldst kill me do't the time is come
[SHK] Thou strikest not me 't is Caesar thou defeat'st
[SHK] Put colour in thy cheek
[SHK] The gods withhold me
[SHK] Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts
[SHK] Though enemy lost aim and could not
[SHK] Eros
[SHK] Wouldst thou be window 'd in great Rome and see
[SHK] Thy master thus with pleach 'd arms bending down
[SHK] His corrigible neck his face subdued
[SHK] To penetrative shame whilst the wheel 'd seat
[SHK] Of fortunate Caesar drawn before him branded
[SHK] His baseness that ensued
[SHK] I would not see't
[SHK] Come then for with a wound I must be cured
[SHK] Draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn
[SHK] Most useful for thy country
[SHK] O sir pardon me
[SHK] When I did make thee free sworest thou not then
[SHK] To do this when I bade thee Do it at once
[SHK] Or thy precedent services are all
[SHK] But accidents unpurposed Draw and come
[SHK] Turn from me then that noble countenance
[SHK] Wherein the worship of the whole world lies
[SHK] Lo thee
[SHK] My sword is drawn
[SHK] Then let it do at once
[SHK] The thing why thou hast drawn it
[SHK] My dear master
[SHK] My captain and my emperor let me say
[SHK] Before I strike this bloody stroke farewell
[SHK] 'T is said man and farewell
[SHK] Farewell great chief Shall I strike now
[SHK] Now Eros
[SHK] Why there then thus I do escape the sorrow
[SHK] Of Antony 's death
[SHK] Thrice-nobler than myself
[SHK] Thou teachest me O valiant Eros what
[SHK] I should and thou couldst not My queen and Eros
[SHK] Have by their brave instruction got upon me
[SHK] A nobleness in record but I will be
[SHK] A bridegroom in my death and run into't
[SHK] As to a lover 's bed Come then and Eros
[SHK] Thy master dies thy scholar to do thus
[SHK] I learn 'd of thee How not dead not dead
[SHK] The guard ho O dispatch me
[SHK] What 's the noise
[SHK] I have done my work in friends O make an end
[SHK] Of what I have begun
[SHK] The star is fall'n
[SHK] And time is at his period
[SHK] Alas and woe
[SHK] Let him that loves me strike me dead
[SHK] Not I
[SHK] Nor I
[SHK] Nor any one
[SHK] Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly
[SHK] This sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings
[SHK] Shall enter me with him
[SHK] Where 's Antony
[SHK] There Diomed there
[SHK] Lives he
[SHK] Wilt thou not answer man
[SHK] Art thou there Diomed Draw thy sword and give me
[SHK] Sufficing strokes for death
[SHK] Most absolute lord
[SHK] My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee
[SHK] When did she send thee
[SHK] Now my lord
[SHK] Where is she
[SHK] Lock 'd in her monument She had a prophesying fear
[SHK] Of what hath come to pass for when she saw --
[SHK] Which never shall be found -- you did suspect
[SHK] She had disposed with Caesar and that your rage
[SHK] Would not be purged she sent you word she was dead
[SHK] But fearing since how it might work hath sent
[SHK] Me to proclaim the truth and I am come
[SHK] I dread too late
[SHK] Too late good Diomed call my guard I prithee
[SHK] What ho the emperor 's guard The guard what ho
[SHK] Come your lord calls
[SHK] Bear me good friends where Cleopatra bides
[SHK] 'T is the last service that I shall command you
[SHK] Woe woe are we sir you may not live to wear
[SHK] All your true followers out
[SHK] Most heavy day
[SHK] Nay good my fellows do not please sharp fate
[SHK] To grace it with your sorrows bid that welcome
[SHK] Which comes to punish us and we punish it
[SHK] Seeming to bear it lightly Take me up
[SHK] I have led you oft carry me now good friends
[SHK] And have my thanks for all
[SHK] O Charmian I will never go from hence
[SHK] Be comforted dear madam
[SHK] No I will not
[SHK] All strange and terrible events are welcome
[SHK] But comforts we despise our size of sorrow
[SHK] Proportion 'd to our cause must be as great
[SHK] As that which makes it
[SHK] How now is he dead
[SHK] His death 's upon him but not dead
[SHK] Look out o the other side your monument
[SHK] His guard have brought him thither
[SHK] O sun
[SHK] Burn the great sphere thou movest in
[SHK] darkling stand
[SHK] The varying shore o the world O Antony
[SHK] Antony Antony Help Charmian help Iras help
[SHK] Help friends below let 's draw him hither
[SHK] Peace
[SHK] Not Caesar 's valour hath o'erthrown Antony
[SHK] But Antony 's hath triumph 'd on itself
[SHK] So it should be that none but Antony
[SHK] Should conquer Antony but woe 't is so
[SHK] I am dying Egypt dying only
[SHK] I here importune death awhile until
[SHK] Of many thousand kisses the poor last
[SHK] I lay up thy lips
[SHK] I dare not dear --
[SHK] Dear my lord pardon -- I dare not
[SHK] Lest I be taken not the imperious show
[SHK] Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
[SHK] Be brooch 'd with me if knife drugs
[SHK] serpents have
[SHK] Edge sting or operation I am safe
[SHK] Your wife Octavia with her modest eyes
[SHK] And still conclusion shall acquire no honour
[SHK] Demuring upon me But come come Antony --
[SHK] Help me my women -- we must draw thee up
[SHK] Assist good friends
[SHK] O quick or I am gone
[SHK] Here 's sport indeed How heavy weighs my lord
[SHK] Our strength is all gone into heaviness
[SHK] That makes the weight had I great Juno 's power
[SHK] The strong-wing 'd Mercury should fetch thee up
[SHK] And set thee by Jove 's side Yet come a little --
[SHK] Wishes were ever fools -- O come come come
[SHK] And welcome welcome die where thou hast lived
[SHK] Quicken with kissing had my lips that power
[SHK] Thus would I wear them out
[SHK] A heavy sight
[SHK] I am dying Egypt dying
[SHK] Give me some wine and let me speak a little
[SHK] No let me speak and let me rail so high
[SHK] That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel
[SHK] Provoked by my offence
[SHK] One word sweet queen
[SHK] Of Caesar seek your honour with your safety O
[SHK] They do not go together
[SHK] Gentle hear me
[SHK] None about Caesar trust but Proculeius
[SHK] My resolution and my hands I 'll trust
[SHK] None about Caesar
[SHK] The miserable change now at my end
[SHK] Lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts
[SHK] In feeding them with those my former fortunes
[SHK] Wherein I lived the greatest prince o the world
[SHK] The noblest and do now not basely die
[SHK] Not cowardly put off my helmet to
[SHK] My countryman -- a Roman by a Roman
[SHK] Valiantly vanquish 'd Now my spirit is going
[SHK] I can no more
[SHK] Noblest of men woo't die
[SHK] Hast thou no care of me shall I abide
[SHK] In this dull world which in thy absence is
[SHK] No better than a sty O see my women
[SHK] The crown o the earth doth melt My lord
[SHK] O wither 'd is the garland of the war
[SHK] The soldier 's pole is fall'n young boys and girls
[SHK] Are level now with men the odds is gone
[SHK] And there is nothing left remarkable
[SHK] Beneath the visiting moon
[SHK] O quietness lady
[SHK] She is dead too our sovereign
[SHK] Lady
[SHK] Madam
[SHK] O madam madam madam
[SHK] Royal Egypt Empress
[SHK] Peace peace Iras
[SHK] No more but e'en a woman and commanded
[SHK] By such poor passion as the maid that milks
[SHK] And does the meanest chares It were for me
[SHK] To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
[SHK] To tell them that this world did equal theirs
[SHK] Till they had stol'n our jewel All 's but naught
[SHK] Patience is scottish and impatience does
[SHK] Become a dog that 's mad then is it sin
[SHK] To rush into the secret house of death
[SHK] Ere death dare come to us How do you women
[SHK] What what good cheer Why how now Charmian
[SHK] My noble girls Ah women women look
[SHK] Our lamp is spent it 's out Good sirs take heart
[SHK] We 'll bury him and then what 's brave
[SHK] what 's noble
[SHK] Let 's do it after the high Roman fashion
[SHK] And make death proud to take us Come away
[SHK] This case of that huge spirit now is cold
[SHK] Ah women women come we have no friend
[SHK] But resolution and the briefest end
[SHK] Go to him Dolabella bid him yield
[SHK] Being so frustrate tell him he mocks
[SHK] The pauses that he makes
[SHK] Caesar I shall
[SHK] Wherefore is that and what art thou that darest
[SHK] Appear thus to us
[SHK] I am call 'd Dercetas
[SHK] Mark Antony I served who best was worthy
[SHK] Best to be served whilst he stood up and spoke
[SHK] He was my master and I wore my life
[SHK] To spend upon his haters If thou please
[SHK] To take me to thee as I was to him
[SHK] I 'll be to Caesar if thou pleasest not
[SHK] I yield thee up my life
[SHK] What is't thou say'st
[SHK] I say O Caesar Antony is dead
[SHK] The breaking of so great a thing should make
[SHK] A greater crack the round world
[SHK] Should have shook lions into civil streets
[SHK] And citizens to their dens the death of Antony
[SHK] Is not a single doom in the name lay
[SHK] A moiety of the world
[SHK] He is dead Caesar
[SHK] Not by a public minister of justice
[SHK] Nor by a hired knife but that self hand
[SHK] Which writ his honour in the acts it did
[SHK] Hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
[SHK] Splitted the heart This is his sword
[SHK] I robb 'd his wound of it behold it stain 'd
[SHK] With his most noble blood
[SHK] Look you sad friends
[SHK] The gods rebuke me but it is tidings
[SHK] To wash the eyes of kings
[SHK] And strange it is
[SHK] That nature must compel us to lament
[SHK] Our most persisted deeds
[SHK] His taints and honours
[SHK] Waged equal with him
[SHK] A rarer spirit never
[SHK] Did steer humanity but you gods will give us
[SHK] Some faults to make us men Caesar is touch 'd
[SHK] When such a spacious mirror 's set before him
[SHK] He needs must see himself
[SHK] O Antony
[SHK] I have follow 'd thee to this but we do lance
[SHK] Diseases in our bodies I must perforce
[SHK] Have shown to thee such a declining day
[SHK] Or look on thine we could not stall together
[SHK] In the whole world but yet let me lament
[SHK] With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
[SHK] That thou my brother my competitor
[SHK] In top of all design my mate in empire
[SHK] Friend and companion in the front of war
[SHK] The arm of mine own body and the heart
[SHK] Where mine his thoughts did kindle -- that our stars
[SHK] Unreconciliable should divide
[SHK] Our equalness to this Hear me good friends --
[SHK] But I will tell you at some meeter season
[SHK] The business of this man looks out of him
[SHK] We 'll hear him what he says Whence are you
[SHK] A poor Egyptian yet The queen my mistress
[SHK] Confined in all she has her monument
[SHK] Of thy intents desires instruction
[SHK] That she preparedly may frame herself
[SHK] To the way she 's forced to
[SHK] Bid her have good heart
[SHK] She soon shall know of us by some of ours
[SHK] How honourable and how kindly we
[SHK] Determine for her for Caesar can not live
[SHK] To be ungentle
[SHK] So the gods preserve thee
[SHK] Come hither Proculeius Go and say
[SHK] We purpose her no shame give her what comforts
[SHK] The quality of her passion shall require
[SHK] Lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke
[SHK] She do defeat us for her life in Rome
[SHK] Would be eternal in our triumph go
[SHK] And with your speediest bring us what she says
[SHK] And how you find of her
[SHK] Caesar I shall
[SHK] Gallus go you along
[SHK] Where 's Dolabella
[SHK] To second Proculeius
[SHK] Dolabella
[SHK] Let him alone for I remember now
[SHK] How he 's employ 'd he shall in time be ready
[SHK] Go with me to my tent where you shall see
[SHK] How hardly I was drawn into this war
[SHK] How calm and gentle I proceeded still
[SHK] In all my writings go with me and see
[SHK] What I can show in this
[SHK] My desolation does begin to make
[SHK] A better life 'T is paltry to be Caesar
[SHK] Not being Fortune he 's but Fortune 's knave
[SHK] A minister of her will and it is great
[SHK] To do that thing that ends all other deeds
[SHK] Which shackles accidents and bolts up change
[SHK] Which sleeps and never palates more the dug
[SHK] The beggar 's nurse and Caesar 's
[SHK] Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt
[SHK] And bids thee study on what fair demands
[SHK] Thou mean'st to have him grant thee
[SHK] What 's thy name
[SHK] My name is Proculeius
[SHK] Antony
[SHK] Did tell me of you bade me trust you but
[SHK] I do not greatly care to be deceived
[SHK] That have no use for trusting If your master
[SHK] Would have a queen his beggar you must tell him
[SHK] That majesty to keep decorum must
[SHK] No less beg than a kingdom if he please
[SHK] To give me conquer 'd Egypt for my son
[SHK] He gives me so much of mine own as I
[SHK] Will kneel to him with thanks
[SHK] Be of good cheer
[SHK] You 're fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing
[SHK] Make your full reference freely to my lord
[SHK] Who is so full of grace that it flows over
[SHK] On all that need let me report to him
[SHK] Your sweet dependency and you shall find
[SHK] A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
[SHK] Where he for grace is kneel 'd to
[SHK] Pray you tell him
[SHK] I am his fortune 's vassal and I send him
[SHK] The greatness he has got I hourly learn
[SHK] A doctrine of obedience and would gladly
[SHK] Look him i the face
[SHK] This I 'll report dear lady
[SHK] Have comfort for I know your plight is pitied
[SHK] Of him that caused it
[SHK] You see how easily she may be surprised
[SHK] Guard her till Caesar come
[SHK] Royal queen
[SHK] O Cleopatra thou art taken queen
[SHK] Quick quick good hands
[SHK] Hold worthy lady hold
[SHK] Do not yourself such wrong who are in this
[SHK] Relieved but not betray 'd
[SHK] What of death too
[SHK] That rids our dogs of languish
[SHK] Cleopatra
[SHK] Do not abuse my master 's bounty by
[SHK] The undoing of yourself let the world see
[SHK] His nobleness well acted which your death
[SHK] Will never let come forth
[SHK] Where art thou death
[SHK] Come hither come come come and take a queen
[SHK] Worthy many babes and beggars
[SHK] O temperance lady
[SHK] Sir I will eat no meat I 'll not drink sir
[SHK] If idle talk will once be necessary
[SHK] I 'll not sleep neither this mortal house I 'll ruin
[SHK] Do Caesar what he can Know sir that I
[SHK] Will not wait pinion 'd at your master 's court
[SHK] Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
[SHK] Of dull Octavia Shall they hoist me up
[SHK] And show me to the shouting varletry
[SHK] Of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt
[SHK] Be gentle grave unto me rather on Nilus mud
[SHK] Lay me stark naked and let the water-flies
[SHK] Blow me into abhorring rather make
[SHK] My country 's high pyramides my gibbet
[SHK] And hang me up in chains
[SHK] You do extend
[SHK] These thoughts of horror further than you shall
[SHK] Find cause in Caesar
[SHK] Proculeius
[SHK] What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows
[SHK] And he hath sent for thee for the queen
[SHK] I 'll take her to my guard
[SHK] So Dolabella
[SHK] It shall content me best be gentle to her
[SHK] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please
[SHK] If you 'll employ me to him
[SHK] Say I would die
[SHK] Most noble empress you have heard of me
[SHK] I can not tell
[SHK] Assuredly you know me
[SHK] No matter sir what I have heard or known
[SHK] You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
[SHK] Is't not your trick
[SHK] I understand not madam
[SHK] I dream 'd there was an Emperor Antony
[SHK] O such another sleep that I might see
[SHK] But such another man
[SHK] If it might please ye --
[SHK] His face was as the heavens and therein stuck
[SHK] A sun and moon which kept their course
[SHK] and lighted
[SHK] The little O the earth
[SHK] Most sovereign creature --
[SHK] His legs bestrid the ocean his rear 'd arm
[SHK] Crested the world his voice was propertied
[SHK] As all the tuned spheres and that to friends
[SHK] But when he meant to quail and shake the orb
[SHK] He was as rattling thunder For his bounty
[SHK] There was no winter i n't an autumn 't was
[SHK] That grew the more by reaping his delights
[SHK] Were dolphin-like they show 'd his back above
[SHK] The element they lived in in his livery
[SHK] Walk 'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were
[SHK] As plates dropp 'd from his pocket
[SHK] Cleopatra
[SHK] Think you there was or might be such a man
[SHK] As this I dream 'd of
[SHK] Gentle madam no
[SHK] You lie up to the hearing of the gods
[SHK] But if there be or ever were one such
[SHK] It 's past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff
[SHK] To vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine
[SHK] And Antony were nature 's piece 'gainst fancy
[SHK] Condemning shadows quite
[SHK] Hear me good madam
[SHK] Your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
[SHK] As answering to the weight would I might never
[SHK] O'ertake pursued success but I do feel
[SHK] By the rebound of yours a grief that smites
[SHK] My very heart at root
[SHK] I thank you sir
[SHK] Know you what Caesar means to do with me
[SHK] I am loath to tell you what I would you knew
[SHK] Nay pray you sir --
[SHK] Though he be honourable --
[SHK] He 'll lead me then in triumph
[SHK] Madam he will I know't
[SHK] Which is the Queen of Egypt
[SHK] It is the emperor madam
[SHK] Arise you shall not kneel
[SHK] I pray you rise rise Egypt
[SHK] Sir the gods
[SHK] Will have it thus my master and my lord
[SHK] I must obey
[SHK] Take to you no hard thoughts
[SHK] The record of what injuries you did us
[SHK] Though written in our flesh we shall remember
[SHK] As things but done by chance
[SHK] Sole sir o the world
[SHK] I can not project mine own cause so well
[SHK] To make it clear but do confess I have
[SHK] Been laden with like frailties which before
[SHK] Have often shamed our sex
[SHK] Cleopatra know
[SHK] We will extenuate rather than enforce
[SHK] If you apply yourself to our intents
[SHK] Which towards you are most gentle you shall find
[SHK] A benefit in this change but if you seek
[SHK] To lay on me a cruelty by taking
[SHK] Antony 's course you shall bereave yourself
[SHK] Of my good purposes and put your children
[SHK] To that destruction which I 'll guard them from
[SHK] If thereon you rely I 'll take my leave
[SHK] And may through all the world 't is yours and we
[SHK] Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
[SHK] Hang in what place you please Here my good lord
[SHK] You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra
[SHK] This is the brief of money plate and jewels
[SHK] I am possess 'd of 't is exactly valued
[SHK] Not petty things admitted Where 's Seleucus
[SHK] Here madam
[SHK] This is my treasurer let him speak my lord
[SHK] Upon his peril that I have reserved
[SHK] To myself nothing Speak the truth Seleucus
[SHK] Madam
[SHK] I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
[SHK] Speak that which is not
[SHK] What have I kept back
[SHK] Enough to purchase what you have made known
[SHK] Nay blush not Cleopatra I approve
[SHK] Your wisdom in the deed
[SHK] See Caesar O behold
[SHK] How pomp is follow 'd mine will now be yours
[SHK] And should we shift estates yours would be mine
[SHK] The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
[SHK] Even make me wild O slave of no more trust
[SHK] Than love that 's hired What goest thou back thou shalt
[SHK] Go back I warrant thee but I 'll catch thine eyes
[SHK] Though they had wings slave soulless villain dog
[SHK] O rarely base
[SHK] Good queen let us entreat you
[SHK] O Caesar what a wounding shame is this
[SHK] That thou vouchsafing here to visit me
[SHK] Doing the honour of thy lordliness
[SHK] To one so meek that mine own servant should
[SHK] Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
[SHK] Addition of his envy Say good Caesar
[SHK] That I some lady trifles have reserved
[SHK] Immoment toys things of such dignity
[SHK] As we greet modern friends withal and say
[SHK] Some nobler token I have kept apart
[SHK] For Livia and Octavia to induce
[SHK] Their mediation must I be unfolded
[SHK] With one that I have bred The gods it smites me
[SHK] Beneath the fall I have
[SHK] Prithee go hence
[SHK] Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
[SHK] Through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man
[SHK] Thou wouldst have mercy on me
[SHK] Forbear Seleucus
[SHK] Be it known that we the greatest are misthought
[SHK] For things that others do and when we fall
[SHK] We answer others merits in our name
[SHK] Are therefore to be pitied
[SHK] Cleopatra
[SHK] Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged
[SHK] Put we i the roll of conquest still be't yours
[SHK] Bestow it at your pleasure and believe
[SHK] Caesar 's no merchant to make prize with you
[SHK] Of things that merchants sold Therefore be cheer 'd
[SHK] Make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen
[SHK] For we intend so to dispose you as
[SHK] Yourself shall give us counsel Feed and sleep
[SHK] Our care and pity is so much upon you
[SHK] That we remain your friend and so adieu
[SHK] My master and my lord
[SHK] Not so Adieu
[SHK] He words me girls he words me that I should not
[SHK] Be noble to myself but hark thee Charmian
[SHK] Finish good lady the bright day is done
[SHK] And we are for the dark
[SHK] Hie thee again
[SHK] I have spoke already and it is provided
[SHK] Go put it to the haste
[SHK] Madam I will
[SHK] Where is the queen
[SHK] Behold sir
[SHK] Dolabella
[SHK] Madam as thereto sworn by your command
[SHK] Which my love makes religion to obey
[SHK] I tell you this Caesar through Syria
[SHK] Intends his journey and within three days
[SHK] You with your children will he send before
[SHK] Make your best use of this I have perform 'd
[SHK] Your pleasure and my promise
[SHK] Dolabella
[SHK] I shall remain your debtor
[SHK] I your servant
[SHK] Adieu good queen I must attend on Caesar
[SHK] Farewell and thanks
[SHK] Now Iras what think'st thou
[SHK] Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown
[SHK] In Rome as well as I mechanic slaves
[SHK] With greasy aprons rules and hammers shall
[SHK] Uplift us to the view in their thick breaths
[SHK] Rank of gross diet shall be enclouded
[SHK] And forced to drink their vapour
[SHK] The gods forbid
[SHK] Nay 't is most certain Iras saucy lictors
[SHK] Will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers
[SHK] Ballad us out o tune the quick comedians
[SHK] Extemporally will stage us and present
[SHK] Our Alexandrian revels Antony
[SHK] Shall be brought drunken forth and I shall see
[SHK] Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
[SHK] I the posture of a whore
[SHK] O the good gods
[SHK] Nay that 's certain
[SHK] I 'll never see 't for I am sure my nails
[SHK] Are stronger than mine eyes
[SHK] Why that 's the way
[SHK] To fool their preparation and to conquer
[SHK] Their most absurd intents
[SHK] Now Charmian
[SHK] Show me my women like a queen go fetch
[SHK] My best attires I am again for Cydnus
[SHK] To meet Mark Antony sirrah Iras go
[SHK] Now noble Charmian we 'll dispatch indeed
[SHK] And when thou hast done this chare I 'll give thee leave
[SHK] To play till doomsday Bring our crown and all
[SHK] Wherefore 's this noise
[SHK] Here is a rural fellow
[SHK] That will not be denied your highness presence
[SHK] He brings you figs
[SHK] Let him come in
[SHK] What poor an instrument
[SHK] May do a noble deed he brings me liberty
[SHK] My resolution 's placed and I have nothing
[SHK] Of woman in me now from head to foot
[SHK] I am marble-constant now the fleeting moon
[SHK] No planet is of mine
[SHK] This is the man
[SHK] Avoid and leave him
[SHK] Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
[SHK] That kills and pains not
[SHK] Truly I have him but I would not be the party
[SHK] that should desire you to touch him for his biting
[SHK] is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or
[SHK] never recover
[SHK] Rememberest thou any that have died o n't
[SHK] Very many men and women too I heard of one of
[SHK] them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman
[SHK] but something given to lie as a woman should not
[SHK] do but in the way of honesty how she died of the
[SHK] biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes
[SHK] a very good report o the worm but he that will
[SHK] believe all that they say shall never be saved by
[SHK] half that they do but this is most fallible the
[SHK] worm 's an odd worm
[SHK] Get thee hence farewell
[SHK] I wish you all joy of the worm
[SHK] Farewell
[SHK] You must think this look you that the worm will
[SHK] do his kind
[SHK] Ay ay farewell
[SHK] Look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the
[SHK] keeping of wise people for indeed there is no
[SHK] goodness in worm
[SHK] Take thou no care it shall be heeded
[SHK] Very good Give it nothing I pray you for it is
[SHK] not worth the feeding
[SHK] Will it eat me
[SHK] You must not think I am so simple but I know the
[SHK] devil himself will not eat a woman I know that a
[SHK] woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her
[SHK] not But truly these same whoreson devils do the
[SHK] gods great harm in their women for in every ten
[SHK] that they make the devils mar five
[SHK] Well get thee gone farewell
[SHK] Yes forsooth I wish you joy o the worm
[SHK] Give me my robe put on my crown I have
[SHK] Immortal longings in me now no more
[SHK] The juice of Egypt 's grape shall moist this lip
[SHK] Yare yare good Iras quick Methinks I hear
[SHK] Antony call I see him rouse himself
[SHK] To praise my noble act I hear him mock
[SHK] The luck of Caesar which the gods give men
[SHK] To excuse their after wrath husband I come
[SHK] Now to that name my courage prove my title
[SHK] I am fire and air my other elements
[SHK] I give to baser life So have you done
[SHK] Come then and take the last warmth of my lips
[SHK] Farewell kind Charmian Iras long farewell
[SHK] Have I the aspic in my lips Dost fall
[SHK] If thou and nature can so gently part
[SHK] The stroke of death is as a lover 's pinch
[SHK] Which hurts and is desired Dost thou lie still
[SHK] If thus thou vanishest thou tell'st the world
[SHK] It is not worth leave-taking
[SHK] Dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say
[SHK] The gods themselves do weep
[SHK] This proves me base
[SHK] If she first meet the curled Antony
[SHK] He 'll make demand of her and spend that kiss
[SHK] Which is my heaven to have Come thou
[SHK] mortal wretch
[SHK] With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
[SHK] Of life at once untie poor venomous fool
[SHK] Be angry and dispatch O couldst thou speak
[SHK] That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
[SHK] Unpolicied
[SHK] O eastern star
[SHK] Peace peace
[SHK] Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
[SHK] That sucks the nurse asleep
[SHK] O break O break
[SHK] As sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle --
[SHK] O Antony -- Nay I will take thee too
[SHK] What should I stay --
[SHK] In this vile world So fare thee well
[SHK] Now boast thee death in thy possession lies
[SHK] A lass unparallel 'd Downy windows close
[SHK] And golden Phoebus never be beheld
[SHK] Of eyes again so royal Your crown 's awry
[SHK] I 'll mend it and then play
[SHK] Where is the queen
[SHK] Speak softly wake her not
[SHK] Caesar hath sent --
[SHK] Too slow a messenger
[SHK] O come apace dispatch I partly feel thee
[SHK] Approach ho All 's not well Caesar 's beguiled
[SHK] There 's Dolabella sent from Caesar call him
[SHK] What work is here Charmian is this well done
[SHK] It is well done and fitting for a princess
[SHK] Descended of so many royal kings
[SHK] Ah soldier
[SHK] How goes it here
[SHK] All dead
[SHK] Caesar thy thoughts
[SHK] Touch their effects in this thyself art coming
[SHK] To see perform 'd the dreaded act which thou
[SHK] So sought'st to hinder
[SHK] O sir you are too sure an augurer
[SHK] That you did fear is done
[SHK] Bravest at the last
[SHK] She levell 'd at our purposes and being royal
[SHK] Took her own way The manner of their deaths
[SHK] I do not see them bleed
[SHK] Who was last with them
[SHK] A simple countryman that brought her figs
[SHK] This was his basket
[SHK] Poison 'd then
[SHK] O Caesar
[SHK] This Charmian lived but now she stood and spake
[SHK] I found her trimming up the diadem
[SHK] On her dead mistress tremblingly she stood
[SHK] And on the sudden dropp 'd
[SHK] O noble weakness
[SHK] If they had swallow 'd poison 'twould appear
[SHK] By external swelling but she looks like sleep
[SHK] As she would catch another Antony
[SHK] In her strong toil of grace
[SHK] Here on her breast
[SHK] There is a vent of blood and something blown
[SHK] The like is on her arm
[SHK] This is an aspic 's trail and these fig-leaves
[SHK] Have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves
[SHK] Upon the caves of Nile
[SHK] Most probable
[SHK] That so she died for her physician tells me
[SHK] She hath pursued conclusions infinite
[SHK] Of easy ways to die Take up her bed
[SHK] And bear her women from the monument
[SHK] She shall be buried by her Antony
[SHK] No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
[SHK] A pair so famous High events as these
[SHK] Strike those that make them and their story is
[SHK] No less in pity than his glory which
[SHK] Brought them to be lamented Our army shall
[SHK] In solemn show attend this funeral
[SHK] And then to Rome Come Dolabella see
[SHK] High order in this great solemnity
[SHK] Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour
[SHK] Draws on apace four happy days bring in
[SHK] Another moon but O methinks how slow
[SHK] This old moon wanes she lingers my desires
[SHK] Like to a step-dame or a dowager
[SHK] Long withering out a young man revenue
[SHK] Four days will quickly steep themselves in night
[SHK] Four nights will quickly dream away the time
[SHK] And then the moon like to a silver bow
[SHK] New-bent in heaven shall behold the night
[SHK] Of our solemnities
[SHK] Go Philostrate
[SHK] Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments
[SHK] Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
[SHK] Turn melancholy forth to funerals
[SHK] The pale companion is not for our pomp
[SHK] Hippolyta I woo 'd thee with my sword
[SHK] And won thy love doing thee injuries
[SHK] But I will wed thee in another key
[SHK] With pomp with triumph and with revelling
[SHK] Happy be Theseus our renowned duke
[SHK] Thanks good Egeus what 's the news with thee
[SHK] Full of vexation come I with complaint
[SHK] Against my child my daughter Hermia
[SHK] Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord
[SHK] This man hath my consent to marry her
[SHK] Stand forth Lysander and my gracious duke
[SHK] This man hath bewitch 'd the bosom of my child
[SHK] Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes
[SHK] And interchanged love-tokens with my child
[SHK] Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
[SHK] With feigning voice verses of feigning love
[SHK] And stolen the impression of her fantasy
[SHK] With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
[SHK] Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
[SHK] Of strong prevailment in unharden 'd youth
[SHK] With cunning hast thou filch 'd my daughter 's heart
[SHK] Turn 'd her obedience which is due to me
[SHK] To stubborn harshness and my gracious duke
[SHK] Be it so she will not here before your grace
[SHK] Consent to marry with Demetrius
[SHK] I beg the ancient privilege of Athens
[SHK] As she is mine I may dispose of her
[SHK] Which shall be either to this gentleman
[SHK] Or to her death according to our law
[SHK] Immediately provided in that case
[SHK] What say you Hermia be advised fair maid
[SHK] To you your father should be as a god
[SHK] One that composed your beauties yea and one
[SHK] To whom you are but as a form in wax
[SHK] By him imprinted and within his power
[SHK] To leave the figure or disfigure it
[SHK] Demetrius is a worthy gentleman
[SHK] So is Lysander
[SHK] In himself he is
[SHK] But in this kind wanting your father 's voice
[SHK] The other must be held the worthier
[SHK] I would my father look 'd but with my eyes
[SHK] Rather your eyes must with his judgment look
[SHK] I do entreat your grace to pardon me
[SHK] I know not by what power I am made bold
[SHK] Nor how it may concern my modesty
[SHK] In such a presence here to plead my thoughts
[SHK] But I beseech your grace that I may know
[SHK] The worst that may befall me in this case
[SHK] If I refuse to wed Demetrius
[SHK] Either to die the death or to abjure
[SHK] For ever the society of men
[SHK] Therefore fair Hermia question your desires
[SHK] Know of your youth examine well your blood
[SHK] Whether if you yield not to your father 's choice
[SHK] You can endure the livery of a nun
[SHK] For aye to be in shady cloister mew 'd
[SHK] To live a barren sister all your life
[SHK] Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
[SHK] Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood
[SHK] To undergo such maiden pilgrimage
[SHK] But earthlier happy is the rose distill 'd
[SHK] Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
[SHK] Grows lives and dies in single blessedness
[SHK] So will I grow so live so die my lord
[SHK] Ere I will my virgin patent up
[SHK] Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
[SHK] My soul consents not to give sovereignty
[SHK] Take time to pause and by the nest new moon --
[SHK] The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
[SHK] For everlasting bond of fellowship --
[SHK] Upon that day either prepare to die
[SHK] For disobedience to your father 's will
[SHK] Or else to wed Demetrius as he would
[SHK] Or on Diana 's altar to protest
[SHK] For aye austerity and single life
[SHK] Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield
[SHK] Thy crazed title to my certain right
[SHK] You have her father 's love Demetrius
[SHK] Let me have Hermia 's do you marry him
[SHK] Scornful Lysander true he hath my love
[SHK] And what is mine my love shall render him
[SHK] And she is mine and all my right of her
[SHK] I do estate unto Demetrius
[SHK] I am my lord as well derived as he
[SHK] As well possess 'd my love is more than his
[SHK] My fortunes every way as fairly rank 'd
[SHK] If not with vantage as Demetrius
[SHK] And which is more than all these boasts can be
[SHK] I am beloved of beauteous Hermia
[SHK] Why should not I then prosecute my right
[SHK] Demetrius I 'll avouch it to his head
[SHK] Made love to Nedar 's daughter Helena
[SHK] And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
[SHK] Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
[SHK] Upon this spotted and inconstant man
[SHK] I must confess that I have heard so much
[SHK] And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
[SHK] But being over-full of self-affairs
[SHK] My mind did lose it But Demetrius come
[SHK] And come Egeus you shall go with me
[SHK] I have some private schooling for you both
[SHK] For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself
[SHK] To fit your fancies to your father 's will
[SHK] Or else the law of Athens yields you up --
[SHK] Which by no means we may extenuate --
[SHK] To death or to a vow of single life
[SHK] Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love
[SHK] Demetrius and Egeus go along
[SHK] I must employ you in some business
[SHK] Against our nuptial and confer with you
[SHK] Of something nearly that concerns yourselves
[SHK] With duty and desire we follow you
[SHK] How now my love why is your cheek so pale
[SHK] How chance the roses there do fade so fast
[SHK] Belike for want of rain which I could well
[SHK] Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
[SHK] Ay me for aught that I could ever read
[SHK] Could ever hear by tale or history
[SHK] The course of true love never did run smooth
[SHK] But either it was different in blood --
[SHK] O cross too high to be enthrall 'd to low
[SHK] Or else misgraffed in respect of years --
[SHK] O spite too old to be engaged to young
[SHK] Or else it stood upon the choice of friends --
[SHK] O hell to choose love by another 's eyes
[SHK] Or if there were a sympathy in choice
[SHK] War death or sickness did lay siege to it
[SHK] Making it momentany as a sound
[SHK] Swift as a shadow short as any dream
[SHK] Brief as the lightning in the collied night
[SHK] That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
[SHK] And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold
[SHK] The jaws of darkness do devour it up
[SHK] So quick bright things come to confusion
[SHK] If then true lovers have been ever cross 'd
[SHK] It stands as an edict in destiny
[SHK] Then let us teach our trial patience
[SHK] Because it is a customary cross
[SHK] As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
[SHK] Wishes and tears poor fancy 's followers
[SHK] A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia
[SHK] I have a widow aunt a dowager
[SHK] Of great revenue and she hath no child
[SHK] From Athens is her house remote seven leagues
[SHK] And she respects me as her only son
[SHK] There gentle Hermia may I marry thee
[SHK] And to that place the sharp Athenian law
[SHK] Can not pursue us If thou lovest me then
[SHK] Steal forth thy father 's house to-morrow night
[SHK] And in the wood a league without the town
[SHK] Where I did meet thee once with Helena
[SHK] To do observance to a morn of May
[SHK] There will I stay for thee
[SHK] My good Lysander
[SHK] I swear to thee by Cupid 's strongest bow
[SHK] By his best arrow with the golden head
[SHK] By the simplicity of Venus doves
[SHK] By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
[SHK] And by that fire which burn 'd the Carthage queen
[SHK] When the false Troyan under sail was seen
[SHK] By all the vows that ever men have broke
[SHK] In number more than ever women spoke
[SHK] In that same place thou hast appointed me
[SHK] To-morrow truly will I meet with thee
[SHK] Keep promise love Look here comes Helena
[SHK] God speed fair Helena whither away
[SHK] Call you me fair that fair again unsay
[SHK] Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair
[SHK] Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue 's sweet air
[SHK] More tuneable than lark to shepherd 's ear
[SHK] When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
[SHK] Sickness is catching O were favour so
[SHK] Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go
[SHK] My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
[SHK] My tongue should catch your tongue 's sweet melody
[SHK] Were the world mine Demetrius being bated
[SHK] The rest I 'd give to be to you translated
[SHK] O teach me how you look and with what art
[SHK] You sway the motion of Demetrius heart
[SHK] I frown upon him yet he loves me still
[SHK] O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
[SHK] I give him curses yet he gives me love
[SHK] O that my prayers could such affection move
[SHK] The more I hate the more he follows me
[SHK] The more I love the more he hateth me
[SHK] His folly Helena is no fault of mine
[SHK] None but your beauty would that fault were mine
[SHK] Take comfort he no more shall see my face
[SHK] Lysander and myself will fly this place
[SHK] Before the time I did Lysander see
[SHK] Seem 'd Athens as a paradise to me
[SHK] O then what graces in my love do dwell
[SHK] That he hath turn 'd a heaven unto a hell
[SHK] Helen to you our minds we will unfold
[SHK] To-morrow night when Phoebe doth behold
[SHK] Her silver visage in the watery glass
[SHK] Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
[SHK] A time that lovers flights doth still conceal
[SHK] Through Athens gates have we devised to steal
[SHK] And in the wood where often you and I
[SHK] Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie
[SHK] Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
[SHK] There my Lysander and myself shall meet
[SHK] And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
[SHK] To seek new friends and stranger companies
[SHK] Farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
[SHK] And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius
[SHK] Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight
[SHK] From lovers food till morrow deep midnight
[SHK] I will my Hermia
[SHK] Helena adieu
[SHK] As you on him Demetrius dote on you
[SHK] How happy some o'er other some can be
[SHK] Through Athens I am thought as fair as she
[SHK] But what of that Demetrius thinks not so
[SHK] He will not know what all but he do know
[SHK] And as he errs doting on Hermia 's eyes
[SHK] So I admiring of his qualities
[SHK] Things base and vile folding no quantity
[SHK] Love can transpose to form and dignity
[SHK] Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
[SHK] And therefore is wing 'd Cupid painted blind
[SHK] Nor hath Love 's mind of any judgement taste
[SHK] Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
[SHK] And therefore is Love said to be a child
[SHK] Because in choice he is so oft beguiled
[SHK] As waggish boys in game themselves forswear
[SHK] So the boy Love is perjured every where
[SHK] For ere Demetrius look 'd on Hermia 's eyne
[SHK] He hail 'd down oaths that he was only mine
[SHK] And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
[SHK] So he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt
[SHK] I will go tell him of fair Hermia 's flight
[SHK] Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
[SHK] Pursue her and for this intelligence
[SHK] If I have thanks it is a dear expense
[SHK] But herein mean I to enrich my pain
[SHK] To have his sight thither and back again
[SHK] Is all our company here
[SHK] You were best to call them generally man by man
[SHK] according to the scrip
[SHK] Here is the scroll of every man 's name which is
[SHK] thought fit through all Athens to play in our
[SHK] interlude before the duke and the duchess on his
[SHK] wedding-day at night
[SHK] First good Peter Quince say what the play treats
[SHK] on then read the names of the actors and so grow
[SHK] to a point
[SHK] Marry our play is The most lamentable comedy and
[SHK] most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby
[SHK] A very good piece of work I assure you and a
[SHK] merry Now good Peter Quince call forth your
[SHK] actors by the scroll Masters spread yourselves
[SHK] Answer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaver
[SHK] Ready Name what part I am for and proceed
[SHK] You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus
[SHK] What is Pyramus a lover or a tyrant
[SHK] A lover that kills himself most gallant for love
[SHK] That will ask some tears in the true performing of
[SHK] it if I do it let the audience look to their
[SHK] eyes I will move storms I will condole in some
[SHK] measure To the rest yet my chief humour is for a
[SHK] tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part to
[SHK] tear a cat in to make all split
[SHK] The raging rocks
[SHK] And shivering shocks
[SHK] Shall break the locks
[SHK] Of prison gates
[SHK] And Phibbus car
[SHK] Shall shine from far
[SHK] And make and mar
[SHK] The foolish Fates
[SHK] This was lofty Now name the rest of the players
[SHK] This is Ercles vein a tyrant 's vein a lover is
[SHK] more condoling
[SHK] Francis Flute the bellows-mender
[SHK] Here Peter Quince
[SHK] Flute you must take Thisby on you
[SHK] What is Thisby a wandering knight
[SHK] It is the lady that Pyramus must love
[SHK] Nay faith let me not play a woman I have a beard coming
[SHK] That 's all one you shall play it in a mask and
[SHK] you may speak as small as you will
[SHK] An I may hide my face let me play Thisby too I 'll
[SHK] speak in a monstrous little voice 'Thisne
[SHK] Thisne 'Ah Pyramus lover dear thy Thisby dear
[SHK] and lady dear
[SHK] No no you must play Pyramus and Flute you Thisby
[SHK] Well proceed
[SHK] Robin Starveling the tailor
[SHK] Here Peter Quince
[SHK] Robin Starveling you must play Thisby 's mother
[SHK] Tom Snout the tinker
[SHK] Here Peter Quince
[SHK] You Pyramus father myself Thisby 's father
[SHK] Snug the joiner you the lion 's part and I
[SHK] hope here is a play fitted
[SHK] Have you the lion 's part written pray you if it
[SHK] be give it me for I am slow of study
[SHK] You may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring
[SHK] Let me play the lion too I will roar that I will
[SHK] do any man 's heart good to hear me I will roar
[SHK] that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again
[SHK] let him roar again
[SHK] An you should do it too terribly you would fright
[SHK] the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek
[SHK] and that were enough to hang us all
[SHK] That would hang us every mother 's son
[SHK] I grant you friends if that you should fright the
[SHK] ladies out of their wits they would have no more
[SHK] discretion but to hang us but I will aggravate my
[SHK] voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
[SHK] sucking dove I will roar you an 'twere any
[SHK] nightingale
[SHK] You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a
[SHK] sweet-faced man a proper man as one shall see in a
[SHK] summer 's day a most lovely gentleman-like man
[SHK] therefore you must needs play Pyramus
[SHK] Well I will undertake it What beard were I best
[SHK] to play it in
[SHK] Why what you will
[SHK] I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
[SHK] beard your orange-tawny beard your purple-in-grain
[SHK] beard or your French-crown-colour beard your
[SHK] perfect yellow
[SHK] Some of your French crowns have no hair at all and
[SHK] then you will play bare-faced But masters here
[SHK] are your parts and I am to entreat you request
[SHK] you and desire you to con them by to-morrow night
[SHK] and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the
[SHK] town by moonlight there will we rehearse for if
[SHK] we meet in the city we shall be dogged with
[SHK] company and our devices known In the meantime I
[SHK] will draw a bill of properties such as our play
[SHK] wants I pray you fail me not
[SHK] We will meet and there we may rehearse most
[SHK] obscenely and courageously Take pains be perfect adieu
[SHK] At the duke 's oak we meet
[SHK] Enough hold or cut bow-strings
[SHK] How now spirit whither wander you
[SHK] Over hill over dale
[SHK] Thorough bush thorough brier
[SHK] Over park over pale
[SHK] Thorough flood thorough fire
[SHK] I do wander everywhere
[SHK] Swifter than the moon 's sphere
[SHK] And I serve the fairy queen
[SHK] To dew her orbs upon the green
[SHK] The cowslips tall her pensioners be
[SHK] In their gold coats spots you see
[SHK] Those be rubies fairy favours
[SHK] In those freckles live their savours
[SHK] I must go seek some dewdrops here
[SHK] And hang a pearl in every cowslip 's ear
[SHK] Farewell thou lob of spirits I 'll be gone
[SHK] Our queen and all our elves come here anon
[SHK] The king doth keep his revels here to-night
[SHK] Take heed the queen come not within his sight
[SHK] For Oberon is passing fell and wrath
[SHK] Because that she as her attendant hath
[SHK] A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king
[SHK] She never had so sweet a changeling
[SHK] And jealous Oberon would have the child
[SHK] Knight of his train to trace the forests wild
[SHK] But she perforce withholds the loved boy
[SHK] Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
[SHK] And now they never meet in grove or green
[SHK] By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
[SHK] But they do square that all their elves for fear
[SHK] Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there
[SHK] Either I mistake your shape and making quite
[SHK] Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
[SHK] Call 'd Robin Goodfellow are not you he
[SHK] That frights the maidens of the villagery
[SHK] Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
[SHK] And bootless make the breathless housewife churn
[SHK] And sometime make the drink to bear no barm
[SHK] Mislead night-wanderers laughing at their harm
[SHK] Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck
[SHK] You do their work and they shall have good luck
[SHK] Are not you he
[SHK] Thou speak'st aright
[SHK] I am that merry wanderer of the night
[SHK] I jest to Oberon and make him smile
[SHK] When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile
[SHK] Neighing in likeness of a filly foal
[SHK] And sometime lurk I in a gossip 's bowl
[SHK] In very likeness of a roasted crab
[SHK] And when she drinks against her lips I bob
[SHK] And on her wither 'd dewlap pour the ale
[SHK] The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
[SHK] Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me
[SHK] Then slip I from her bum down topples she
[SHK] And 'tailor cries and falls into a cough
[SHK] And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
[SHK] And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
[SHK] A merrier hour was never wasted there
[SHK] But room fairy here comes Oberon
[SHK] And here my mistress Would that he were gone
[SHK] Ill met by moonlight proud Titania
[SHK] What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence
[SHK] I have forsworn his bed and company
[SHK] Tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord
[SHK] Then I must be thy lady but I know
[SHK] When thou hast stolen away from fairy land
[SHK] And in the shape of Corin sat all day
[SHK] Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
[SHK] To amorous Phillida Why art thou here
[SHK] Come from the farthest Steppe of India
[SHK] But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
[SHK] Your buskin 'd mistress and your warrior love
[SHK] To Theseus must be wedded and you come
[SHK] To give their bed joy and prosperity
[SHK] How canst thou thus for shame Titania
[SHK] Glance at my credit with Hippolyta
[SHK] Knowing I know thy love to Theseus
[SHK] Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
[SHK] From Perigenia whom he ravished
[SHK] And make him with fair AEgle break his faith
[SHK] With Ariadne and Antiopa
[SHK] These are the forgeries of jealousy
[SHK] And never since the middle summer 's spring
[SHK] Met we on hill in dale forest or mead
[SHK] By paved fountain or by rushy brook
[SHK] Or in the beached margent of the sea
[SHK] To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
[SHK] But with thy brawls thou hast disturb 'd our sport
[SHK] Therefore the winds piping to us in vain
[SHK] As in revenge have suck 'd up from the sea
[SHK] Contagious fogs which falling in the land
[SHK] Have every pelting river made so proud
[SHK] That they have overborne their continents
[SHK] The ox hath therefore stretch 'd his yoke in vain
[SHK] The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
[SHK] Hath rotted ere his youth attain 'd a beard
[SHK] The fold stands empty in the drowned field
[SHK] And crows are fatted with the murrion flock
[SHK] The nine men 's morris is fill 'd up with mud
[SHK] And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
[SHK] For lack of tread are undistinguishable
[SHK] The human mortals want their winter here
[SHK] No night is now with hymn or carol blest
[SHK] Therefore the moon the governess of floods
[SHK] Pale in her anger washes all the air
[SHK] That rheumatic diseases do abound
[SHK] And thorough this distemperature we see
[SHK] The seasons alter hoary-headed frosts
[SHK] Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
[SHK] And on old Hiems thin and icy crown
[SHK] An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
[SHK] Is as in mockery set the spring the summer
[SHK] The childing autumn angry winter change
[SHK] Their wonted liveries and the mazed world
[SHK] By their increase now knows not which is which
[SHK] And this same progeny of evils comes
[SHK] From our debate from our dissension
[SHK] We are their parents and original
[SHK] Do you amend it then it lies in you
[SHK] Why should Titania cross her Oberon
[SHK] I do but beg a little changeling boy
[SHK] To be my henchman
[SHK] Set your heart at rest
[SHK] The fairy land buys not the child of me
[SHK] His mother was a votaress of my order
[SHK] And in the spiced Indian air by night
[SHK] Full often hath she gossip 'd by my side
[SHK] And sat with me on Neptune 's yellow sands
[SHK] Marking the embarked traders on the flood
[SHK] When we have laugh 'd to see the sails conceive
[SHK] And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind
[SHK] Which she with pretty and with swimming gait
[SHK] Following -- her womb then rich with my young squire --
[SHK] Would imitate and sail upon the land
[SHK] To fetch me trifles and return again
[SHK] As from a voyage rich with merchandise
[SHK] But she being mortal of that boy did die
[SHK] And for her sake do I rear up her boy
[SHK] And for her sake I will not part with him
[SHK] How long within this wood intend you stay
[SHK] Perchance till after Theseus wedding-day
[SHK] If you will patiently dance in our round
[SHK] And see our moonlight revels go with us
[SHK] If not shun me and I will spare your haunts
[SHK] Give me that boy and I will go with thee
[SHK] Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away
[SHK] We shall chide downright if I longer stay
[SHK] Well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
[SHK] Till I torment thee for this injury
[SHK] My gentle Puck come hither Thou rememberest
[SHK] Since once I sat upon a promontory
[SHK] And heard a mermaid on a dolphin 's back
[SHK] Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
[SHK] That the rude sea grew civil at her song
[SHK] And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
[SHK] To hear the sea-maid 's music
[SHK] I remember
[SHK] That very time I saw but thou couldst not
[SHK] Flying between the cold moon and the earth
[SHK] Cupid all arm 'd a certain aim he took
[SHK] At a fair vestal throned by the west
[SHK] And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow
[SHK] As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
[SHK] But I might see young Cupid 's fiery shaft
[SHK] Quench 'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon
[SHK] And the imperial votaress passed on
[SHK] In maiden meditation fancy-free
[SHK] Yet mark 'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell
[SHK] It fell upon a little western flower
[SHK] Before milk-white now purple with love 's wound
[SHK] And maidens call it love-in-idleness
[SHK] Fetch me that flower the herb I shew 'd thee once
[SHK] The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
[SHK] Will make or man or woman madly dote
[SHK] Upon the next live creature that it sees
[SHK] Fetch me this herb and be thou here again
[SHK] Ere the leviathan can swim a league
[SHK] I 'll put a girdle round about the earth
[SHK] In forty minutes
[SHK] Having once this juice
[SHK] I 'll watch Titania when she is asleep
[SHK] And drop the liquor of it in her eyes
[SHK] The next thing then she waking looks upon
[SHK] Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
[SHK] On meddling monkey or on busy ape
[SHK] She shall pursue it with the soul of love
[SHK] And ere I take this charm from off her sight
[SHK] As I can take it with another herb
[SHK] I 'll make her render up her page to me
[SHK] But who comes here I am invisible
[SHK] And I will overhear their conference
[SHK] I love thee not therefore pursue me not
[SHK] Where is Lysander and fair Hermia
[SHK] The one I 'll slay the other slayeth me
[SHK] Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood
[SHK] And here am I and wode within this wood
[SHK] Because I can not meet my Hermia
[SHK] Hence get thee gone and follow me no more
[SHK] You draw me you hard-hearted adamant
[SHK] But yet you draw not iron for my heart
[SHK] Is true as steel leave you your power to draw
[SHK] And I shall have no power to follow you
[SHK] Do I entice you do I speak you fair
[SHK] Or rather do I not in plainest truth
[SHK] Tell you I do not nor I can not love you
[SHK] And even for that do I love you the more
[SHK] I am your spaniel and Demetrius
[SHK] The more you beat me I will fawn on you
[SHK] Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
[SHK] Neglect me lose me only give me leave
[SHK] Unworthy as I am to follow you
[SHK] What worser place can I beg in your love --
[SHK] And yet a place of high respect with me --
[SHK] Than to be used as you use your dog
[SHK] Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
[SHK] For I am sick when I do look on thee
[SHK] And I am sick when I look not on you
[SHK] You do impeach your modesty too much
[SHK] To leave the city and commit yourself
[SHK] Into the hands of one that loves you not
[SHK] To trust the opportunity of night
[SHK] And the ill counsel of a desert place
[SHK] With the rich worth of your virginity
[SHK] Your virtue is my privilege for that
[SHK] It is not night when I do see your face
[SHK] Therefore I think I am not in the night
[SHK] Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
[SHK] For you in my respect are all the world
[SHK] Then how can it be said I am alone
[SHK] When all the world is here to look on me
[SHK] I 'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
[SHK] And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
[SHK] The wildest hath not such a heart as you
[SHK] Run when you will the story shall be changed
[SHK] Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase
[SHK] The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
[SHK] Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
[SHK] When cowardice pursues and valour flies
[SHK] I will not stay thy questions let me go
[SHK] Or if thou follow me do not believe
[SHK] But I shall do thee mischief in the wood
[SHK] Ay in the temple in the town the field
[SHK] You do me mischief Fie Demetrius
[SHK] Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
[SHK] We can not fight for love as men may do
[SHK] We should be wood and were not made to woo
[SHK] I 'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
[SHK] To die upon the hand I love so well
[SHK] Fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
[SHK] Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
[SHK] Hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer
[SHK] Ay there it is
[SHK] I pray thee give it me
[SHK] I know a bank where the wild thyme blows
[SHK] Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
[SHK] Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine
[SHK] With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine
[SHK] There sleeps Titania sometime of the night
[SHK] Lull 'd in these flowers with dances and delight
[SHK] And there the snake throws her enamell 'd skin
[SHK] Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
[SHK] And with the juice of this I 'll streak her eyes
[SHK] And make her full of hateful fantasies
[SHK] Take thou some of it and seek through this grove
[SHK] A sweet Athenian lady is in love
[SHK] With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
[SHK] But do it when the next thing he espies
[SHK] May be the lady thou shalt know the man
[SHK] By the Athenian garments he hath on
[SHK] Effect it with some care that he may prove
[SHK] More fond on her than she upon her love
[SHK] And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
[SHK] Fear not my lord your servant shall do so
[SHK] Come now a roundel and a fairy song
[SHK] Then for the third part of a minute hence
[SHK] Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds
[SHK] Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings
[SHK] To make my small elves coats and some keep back
[SHK] The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
[SHK] At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep
[SHK] Then to your offices and let me rest
[SHK] You spotted snakes with double tongue
[SHK] Thorny hedgehogs be not seen
[SHK] Newts and blind-worms do no wrong
[SHK] Come not near our fairy queen
[SHK] Philomel with melody
[SHK] Sing in our sweet lullaby
[SHK] Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
[SHK] Never harm
[SHK] Nor spell nor charm
[SHK] Come our lovely lady nigh
[SHK] So good night with lullaby
[SHK] Weaving spiders come not here
[SHK] Hence you long-legg 'd spinners hence
[SHK] Beetles black approach not near
[SHK] Worm nor snail do no offence
[SHK] Philomel with melody c
[SHK] Hence away now all is well
[SHK] One aloof stand sentinel
[SHK] What thou seest when thou dost wake
[SHK] Do it for thy true-love take
[SHK] Love and languish for his sake
[SHK] Be it ounce or cat or bear
[SHK] Pard or boar with bristled hair
[SHK] In thy eye that shall appear
[SHK] When thou wakest it is thy dear
[SHK] Wake when some vile thing is near
[SHK] Fair love you faint with wandering in the wood
[SHK] And to speak troth I have forgot our way
[SHK] We 'll rest us Hermia if you think it good
[SHK] And tarry for the comfort of the day
[SHK] Be it so Lysander find you out a bed
[SHK] For I upon this bank will rest my head
[SHK] One turf shall serve as pillow for us both
[SHK] One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
[SHK] Nay good Lysander for my sake my dear
[SHK] Lie further off yet do not lie so near
[SHK] O take the sense sweet of my innocence
[SHK] Love takes the meaning in love 's conference
[SHK] I mean that my heart unto yours is knit
[SHK] So that but one heart we can make of it
[SHK] Two bosoms interchained with an oath
[SHK] So then two bosoms and a single troth
[SHK] Then by your side no bed-room me deny
[SHK] For lying so Hermia I do not lie
[SHK] Lysander riddles very prettily
[SHK] Now much beshrew my manners and my pride
[SHK] If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
[SHK] But gentle friend for love and courtesy
[SHK] Lie further off in human modesty
[SHK] Such separation as may well be said
[SHK] Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
[SHK] So far be distant and good night sweet friend
[SHK] Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
[SHK] Amen amen to that fair prayer say I
[SHK] And then end life when I end loyalty
[SHK] Here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
[SHK] With half that wish the wisher 's eyes be press 'd
[SHK] Through the forest have I gone
[SHK] But Athenian found I none
[SHK] On whose eyes I might approve
[SHK] This flower 's force in stirring love
[SHK] Night and silence. -- Who is here
[SHK] Weeds of Athens he doth wear
[SHK] This is he my master said
[SHK] Despised the Athenian maid
[SHK] And here the maiden sleeping sound
[SHK] On the dank and dirty ground
[SHK] Pretty soul she durst not lie
[SHK] Near this lack-love this kill-courtesy
[SHK] Churl upon thy eyes I throw
[SHK] All the power this charm doth owe
[SHK] When thou wakest let love forbid
[SHK] Sleep his seat on thy eyelid
[SHK] So awake when I am gone
[SHK] For I must now to Oberon
[SHK] Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
[SHK] I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
[SHK] O wilt thou darkling leave me do not so
[SHK] Stay on thy peril I alone will go
[SHK] O I am out of breath in this fond chase
[SHK] The more my prayer the lesser is my grace
[SHK] Happy is Hermia wheresoe'er she lies
[SHK] For she hath blessed and attractive eyes
[SHK] How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears
[SHK] If so my eyes are oftener wash 'd than hers
[SHK] No no I am as ugly as a bear
[SHK] For beasts that meet me run away for fear
[SHK] Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
[SHK] Do as a monster fly my presence thus
[SHK] What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
[SHK] Made me compare with Hermia 's sphery eyne
[SHK] But who is here Lysander on the ground
[SHK] Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound
[SHK] Lysander if you live good sir awake
[SHK] Transparent Helena Nature shows art
[SHK] That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
[SHK] Where is Demetrius O how fit a word
[SHK] Is that vile name to perish on my sword
[SHK] Do not say so Lysander say not so
[SHK] What though he love your Hermia Lord what though
[SHK] Yet Hermia still loves you then be content
[SHK] Content with Hermia No I do repent
[SHK] The tedious minutes I with her have spent
[SHK] Not Hermia but Helena I love
[SHK] Who will not change a raven for a dove
[SHK] The will of man is by his reason sway 'd
[SHK] And reason says you are the worthier maid
[SHK] Things growing are not ripe until their season
[SHK] So I being young till now ripe not to reason
[SHK] And touching now the point of human skill
[SHK] Reason becomes the marshal to my will
[SHK] And leads me to your eyes where I o'erlook
[SHK] Love 's stories written in love 's richest book
[SHK] Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born
[SHK] When at your hands did I deserve this scorn
[SHK] Is't not enough is't not enough young man
[SHK] That I did never no nor never can
[SHK] Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius eye
[SHK] But you must flout my insufficiency
[SHK] Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
[SHK] In such disdainful manner me to woo
[SHK] But fare you well perforce I must confess
[SHK] I thought you lord of more true gentleness
[SHK] O that a lady of one man refused
[SHK] Should of another therefore be abused
[SHK] She sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there
[SHK] And never mayst thou come Lysander near
[SHK] For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
[SHK] The deepest loathing to the stomach brings
[SHK] Or as tie heresies that men do leave
[SHK] Are hated most of those they did deceive
[SHK] So thou my surfeit and my heresy
[SHK] Of all be hated but the most of me
[SHK] And all my powers address your love and might
[SHK] To honour Helen and to be her knight
[SHK] To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
[SHK] Ay me for pity what a dream was here
[SHK] Lysander look how I do quake with fear
[SHK] Methought a serpent eat my heart away
[SHK] And you sat smiling at his cruel pray
[SHK] Lysander what removed Lysander lord
[SHK] What out of hearing gone no sound no word
[SHK] Alack where are you speak an if you hear
[SHK] Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear
[SHK] No then I well perceive you all not nigh
[SHK] Either death or you I 'll find immediately
[SHK] Are we all met
[SHK] Pat pat and here 's a marvellous convenient place
[SHK] for our rehearsal This green plot shall be our
[SHK] stage this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house and we
[SHK] will do it in action as we will do it before the duke
[SHK] Peter Quince --
[SHK] What sayest thou bully Bottom
[SHK] There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
[SHK] Thisby that will never please First Pyramus must
[SHK] draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies
[SHK] can not abide How answer you that
[SHK] By r lakin a parlous fear
[SHK] I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
[SHK] Not a whit I have a device to make all well
[SHK] Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to
[SHK] say we will do no harm with our swords and that
[SHK] Pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more
[SHK] better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not
[SHK] Pyramus but Bottom the weaver this will put them
[SHK] out of fear
[SHK] Well we will have such a prologue and it shall be
[SHK] written in eight and six
[SHK] No make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
[SHK] Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
[SHK] I fear it I promise you
[SHK] Masters you ought to consider with yourselves to
[SHK] bring in -- God shield us -- a lion among ladies is a
[SHK] most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful
[SHK] wild-fowl than your lion living and we ought to
[SHK] look to 't
[SHK] Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
[SHK] Nay you must name his name and half his face must
[SHK] be seen through the lion 's neck and he himself
[SHK] must speak through saying thus or to the same
[SHK] defect -- 'Ladies -- or 'Fair-ladies -- I would wish
[SHK] You -- or I would request you -- or I would
[SHK] entreat you -- not to fear not to tremble my life
[SHK] for yours If you think I come hither as a lion it
[SHK] were pity of my life no I am no such thing I am a
[SHK] man as other men are and there indeed let him name
[SHK] his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner
[SHK] Well it shall be so But there is two hard things
[SHK] that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for
[SHK] you know Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight
[SHK] Doth the moon shine that night we play our play
[SHK] A calendar a calendar look in the almanac find
[SHK] out moonshine find out moonshine
[SHK] Yes it doth shine that night
[SHK] Why then may you leave a casement of the great
[SHK] chamber window where we play open and the moon
[SHK] may shine in at the casement
[SHK] Ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
[SHK] and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to
[SHK] present the person of Moonshine Then there is
[SHK] another thing we must have a wall in the great
[SHK] chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did
[SHK] talk through the chink of a wall
[SHK] You can never bring in a wall What say you Bottom
[SHK] Some man or other must present Wall and let him
[SHK] have some plaster or some loam or some rough-cast
[SHK] about him to signify wall and let him hold his
[SHK] fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus
[SHK] and Thisby whisper
[SHK] If that may be then all is well Come sit down
[SHK] every mother 's son and rehearse your parts
[SHK] Pyramus you begin when you have spoken your
[SHK] speech enter into that brake and so every one
[SHK] according to his cue
[SHK] What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here
[SHK] So near the cradle of the fairy queen
[SHK] What a play toward I 'll be an auditor
[SHK] An actor too perhaps if I see cause
[SHK] Speak Pyramus Thisby stand forth
[SHK] Thisby the flowers of odious savours sweet --
[SHK] Odours odours
[SHK] -- odours savours sweet
[SHK] So hath thy breath my dearest Thisby dear
[SHK] But hark a voice stay thou but here awhile
[SHK] And by and by I will to thee appear
[SHK] A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here
[SHK] Must I speak now
[SHK] Ay marry must you for you must understand he goes
[SHK] but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again
[SHK] Most radiant Pyramus most lily-white of hue
[SHK] Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier
[SHK] Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew
[SHK] As true as truest horse that yet would never tire
[SHK] I 'll meet thee Pyramus at Ninny 's tomb
[SHK] 'Ninus tomb man why you must not speak that
[SHK] yet that you answer to Pyramus you speak all your
[SHK] part at once cues and all Pyramus enter your cue
[SHK] is past it is 'never tire
[SHK] O -- As true as truest horse that yet would
[SHK] never tire
[SHK] If I were fair Thisby I were only thine
[SHK] O monstrous O strange we are haunted Pray
[SHK] masters fly masters Help
[SHK] I 'll follow you I 'll lead you about a round
[SHK] Through bog through bush through brake through brier
[SHK] Sometime a horse I 'll be sometime a hound
[SHK] A hog a headless bear sometime a fire
[SHK] And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn
[SHK] Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
[SHK] Why do they run away this is a knavery of them to
[SHK] make me afeard
[SHK] O Bottom thou art changed what do I see on thee
[SHK] What do you see you see an asshead of your own do
[SHK] you
[SHK] Bless thee Bottom bless thee thou art
[SHK] translated
[SHK] I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me
[SHK] to fright me if they could But I will not stir
[SHK] from this place do what they can I will walk up
[SHK] and down here and I will sing that they shall hear
[SHK] I am not afraid
[SHK] The ousel cock so black of hue
[SHK] With orange-tawny bill
[SHK] The throstle with his note so true
[SHK] The wren with little quill --
[SHK] The finch the sparrow and the lark
[SHK] The plain-song cuckoo gray
[SHK] Whose note full many a man doth mark
[SHK] And dares not answer nay --
[SHK] for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish
[SHK] a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry
[SHK] 'cuckoo never so
[SHK] I pray thee gentle mortal sing again
[SHK] Mine ear is much enamour 'd of thy note
[SHK] So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
[SHK] And thy fair virtue 's force perforce doth move me
[SHK] On the first view to say to swear I love thee
[SHK] Methinks mistress you should have little reason
[SHK] for that and yet to say the truth reason and
[SHK] love keep little company together now-a-days the
[SHK] more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
[SHK] make them friends Nay I can gleek upon occasion
[SHK] Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
[SHK] Not so neither but if I had wit enough to get out
[SHK] of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turn
[SHK] Out of this wood do not desire to go
[SHK] Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
[SHK] I am a spirit of no common rate
[SHK] The summer still doth tend upon my state
[SHK] And I do love thee therefore go with me
[SHK] I 'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
[SHK] And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
[SHK] And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
[SHK] And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
[SHK] That thou shalt like an airy spirit go
[SHK] Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed
[SHK] Ready
[SHK] And I
[SHK] And I
[SHK] And I
[SHK] Where shall we go
[SHK] Be kind and courteous to this gentleman
[SHK] Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
[SHK] Feed him with apricocks and dewberries
[SHK] With purple grapes green figs and mulberries
[SHK] The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees
[SHK] And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
[SHK] And light them at the fiery glow-worm 's eyes
[SHK] To have my love to bed and to arise
[SHK] And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
[SHK] To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
[SHK] Nod to him elves and do him courtesies
[SHK] Hail mortal
[SHK] Hail
[SHK] Hail
[SHK] Hail
[SHK] I cry your worship 's mercy heartily I beseech your
[SHK] worship 's name
[SHK] Cobweb
[SHK] I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master
[SHK] Cobweb if I cut my finger I shall make bold with
[SHK] you Your name honest gentleman
[SHK] Peaseblossom
[SHK] I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your
[SHK] mother and to Master Peascod your father Good
[SHK] Master Peaseblossom I shall desire you of more
[SHK] acquaintance too Your name I beseech you sir
[SHK] Mustardseed
[SHK] Good Master Mustardseed I know your patience well
[SHK] that same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath
[SHK] devoured many a gentleman of your house I promise
[SHK] you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now I
[SHK] desire your more acquaintance good Master
[SHK] Mustardseed
[SHK] Come wait upon him lead him to my bower
[SHK] The moon methinks looks with a watery eye
[SHK] And when she weeps weeps every little flower
[SHK] Lamenting some enforced chastity
[SHK] Tie up my love 's tongue bring him silently
[SHK] I wonder if Titania be awaked
[SHK] Then what it was that next came in her eye
[SHK] Which she must dote on in extremity
[SHK] Here comes my messenger
[SHK] How now mad spirit
[SHK] What night-rule now about this haunted grove
[SHK] My mistress with a monster is in love
[SHK] Near to her close and consecrated bower
[SHK] While she was in her dull and sleeping hour
[SHK] A crew of patches rude mechanicals
[SHK] That work for bread upon Athenian stalls
[SHK] Were met together to rehearse a play
[SHK] Intended for great Theseus nuptial-day
[SHK] The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort
[SHK] Who Pyramus presented in their sport
[SHK] Forsook his scene and enter 'd in a brake
[SHK] When I did him at this advantage take
[SHK] An ass 's nole I fixed on his head
[SHK] Anon his Thisbe must be answered
[SHK] And forth my mimic comes When they him spy
[SHK] As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
[SHK] Or russet-pated choughs many in sort
[SHK] Rising and cawing at the gun 's report
[SHK] Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
[SHK] So at his sight away his fellows fly
[SHK] And at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls
[SHK] He murder cries and help from Athens calls
[SHK] Their sense thus weak lost with their fears
[SHK] thus strong
[SHK] Made senseless things begin to do them wrong
[SHK] For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
[SHK] Some sleeves some hats from yielders all
[SHK] things catch
[SHK] I led them on in this distracted fear
[SHK] And left sweet Pyramus translated there
[SHK] When in that moment so it came to pass
[SHK] Titania waked and straightway loved an ass
[SHK] This falls out better than I could devise
[SHK] But hast thou yet latch 'd the Athenian 's eyes
[SHK] With the love-juice as I did bid thee do
[SHK] I took him sleeping -- that is finish 'd too --
[SHK] And the Athenian woman by his side
[SHK] That when he waked of force she must be eyed
[SHK] Stand close this is the same Athenian
[SHK] This is the woman but not this the man
[SHK] O why rebuke you him that loves you so
[SHK] Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
[SHK] Now I but chide but I should use thee worse
[SHK] For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse
[SHK] If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep
[SHK] Being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep
[SHK] And kill me too
[SHK] The sun was not so true unto the day
[SHK] As he to me would he have stolen away
[SHK] From sleeping Hermia I 'll believe as soon
[SHK] This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
[SHK] May through the centre creep and so displease
[SHK] Her brother 's noontide with Antipodes
[SHK] It can not be but thou hast murder 'd him
[SHK] So should a murderer look so dead so grim
[SHK] So should the murder 'd look and so should I
[SHK] Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
[SHK] Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
[SHK] As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere
[SHK] What 's this to my Lysander where is he
[SHK] Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me
[SHK] I had rather give his carcass to my hounds
[SHK] Out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds
[SHK] Of maiden 's patience Hast thou slain him then
[SHK] Henceforth be never number 'd among men
[SHK] O once tell true tell true even for my sake
[SHK] Durst thou have look 'd upon him being awake
[SHK] And hast thou kill 'd him sleeping O brave touch
[SHK] Could not a worm an adder do so much
[SHK] An adder did it for with doubler tongue
[SHK] Than thine thou serpent never adder stung
[SHK] You spend your passion on a misprised mood
[SHK] I am not guilty of Lysander 's blood
[SHK] Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell
[SHK] I pray thee tell me then that he is well
[SHK] An if I could what should I get therefore
[SHK] A privilege never to see me more
[SHK] And from thy hated presence part I so
[SHK] See me no more whether he be dead or no
[SHK] There is no following her in this fierce vein
[SHK] Here therefore for a while I will remain
[SHK] So sorrow 's heaviness doth heavier grow
[SHK] For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
[SHK] Which now in some slight measure it will pay
[SHK] If for his tender here I make some stay
[SHK] What hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
[SHK] And laid the love-juice on some true-love 's sight
[SHK] Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
[SHK] Some true love turn 'd and not a false turn 'd true
[SHK] Then fate o'er-rules that one man holding troth
[SHK] A million fail confounding oath on oath
[SHK] About the wood go swifter than the wind
[SHK] And Helena of Athens look thou find
[SHK] All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer
[SHK] With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
[SHK] By some illusion see thou bring her here
[SHK] I 'll charm his eyes against she do appear
[SHK] I go I go look how I go
[SHK] Swifter than arrow from the Tartar 's bow
[SHK] Flower of this purple dye
[SHK] Hit with Cupid 's archery
[SHK] Sink in apple of his eye
[SHK] When his love he doth espy
[SHK] Let her shine as gloriously
[SHK] As the Venus of the sky
[SHK] When thou wakest if she be by
[SHK] Beg of her for remedy
[SHK] Captain of our fairy band
[SHK] Helena is here at hand
[SHK] And the youth mistook by me
[SHK] Pleading for a lover 's fee
[SHK] Shall we their fond pageant see
[SHK] Lord what fools these mortals be
[SHK] Stand aside the noise they make
[SHK] Will cause Demetrius to awake
[SHK] Then will two at once woo one
[SHK] That must needs be sport alone
[SHK] And those things do best please me
[SHK] That befal preposterously
[SHK] Why should you think that I should woo in scorn
[SHK] Scorn and derision never come in tears
[SHK] Look when I vow I weep and vows so born
[SHK] In their nativity all truth appears
[SHK] How can these things in me seem scorn to you
[SHK] Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
[SHK] You do advance your cunning more and more
[SHK] When truth kills truth O devilish-holy fray
[SHK] These vows are Hermia 's will you give her o'er
[SHK] Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
[SHK] Your vows to her and me put in two scales
[SHK] Will even weigh and both as light as tales
[SHK] I had no judgment when to her I swore
[SHK] Nor none in my mind now you give her o'er
[SHK] Demetrius loves her and he loves not you
[SHK] To what my love shall I compare thine eyne
[SHK] Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show
[SHK] Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
[SHK] That pure congealed white high Taurus snow
[SHK] Fann 'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
[SHK] When thou hold'st up thy hand O let me kiss
[SHK] This princess of pure white this seal of bliss
[SHK] O spite O hell I see you all are bent
[SHK] To set against me for your merriment
[SHK] If you we re civil and knew courtesy
[SHK] You would not do me thus much injury
[SHK] Can you not hate me as I know you do
[SHK] But you must join in souls to mock me too
[SHK] If you were men as men you are in show
[SHK] You would not use a gentle lady so
[SHK] To vow and swear and superpraise my parts
[SHK] When I am sure you hate me with your hearts
[SHK] You both are rivals and love Hermia
[SHK] And now both rivals to mock Helena
[SHK] A trim exploit a manly enterprise
[SHK] To conjure tears up in a poor maid 's eyes
[SHK] With your derision none of noble sort
[SHK] Would so offend a virgin and extort
[SHK] A poor soul 's patience all to make you sport
[SHK] You are unkind Demetrius be not so
[SHK] For you love Hermia this you know I know
[SHK] And here with all good will with all my heart
[SHK] In Hermia 's love I yield you up my part
[SHK] And yours of Helena to me bequeath
[SHK] Whom I do love and will do till my death
[SHK] Never did mockers waste more idle breath
[SHK] Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none
[SHK] If e'er I loved her all that love is gone
[SHK] My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn 'd
[SHK] And now to Helen is it home return 'd
[SHK] There to remain
[SHK] Helen it is not so
[SHK] Disparage not the faith thou dost not know
[SHK] Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
[SHK] Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
[SHK] Dark night that from the eye his function takes
[SHK] The ear more quick of apprehension makes
[SHK] Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
[SHK] It pays the hearing double recompense
[SHK] Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found
[SHK] Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound
[SHK] But why unkindly didst thou leave me so
[SHK] Why should he stay whom love doth press to go
[SHK] What love could press Lysander from my side
[SHK] Lysander 's love that would not let him bide
[SHK] Fair Helena who more engilds the night
[SHK] Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light
[SHK] Why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know
[SHK] The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so
[SHK] You speak not as you think it can not be
[SHK] Lo she is one of this confederacy
[SHK] Now I perceive they have conjoin 'd all three
[SHK] To fashion this false sport in spite of me
[SHK] Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid
[SHK] Have you conspired have you with these contrived
[SHK] To bait me with this foul derision
[SHK] Is all the counsel that we two have shared
[SHK] The sisters vows the hours that we have spent
[SHK] When we have chid the hasty-footed time
[SHK] For parting us -- O is it all forgot
[SHK] All school-days friendship childhood innocence
[SHK] We Hermia like two artificial gods
[SHK] Have with our needles created both one flower
[SHK] Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
[SHK] Both warbling of one song both in one key
[SHK] As if our hands our sides voices and minds
[SHK] Had been incorporate So we grow together
[SHK] Like to a double cherry seeming parted
[SHK] But yet an union in partition
[SHK] Two lovely berries moulded on one stem
[SHK] So with two seeming bodies but one heart
[SHK] Two of the first like coats in heraldry
[SHK] Due but to one and crowned with one crest
[SHK] And will you rent our ancient love asunder
[SHK] To join with men in scorning your poor friend
[SHK] It is not friendly 't is not maidenly
[SHK] Our sex as well as I may chide you for it
[SHK] Though I alone do feel the injury
[SHK] I am amazed at your passionate words
[SHK] I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
[SHK] Have you not set Lysander as in scorn
[SHK] To follow me and praise my eyes and face
[SHK] And made your other love Demetrius
[SHK] Who even but now did spurn me with his foot
[SHK] To call me goddess nymph divine and rare
[SHK] Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this
[SHK] To her he hates and wherefore doth Lysander
[SHK] Deny your love so rich within his soul
[SHK] And tender me forsooth affection
[SHK] But by your setting on by your consent
[SHK] What thought I be not so in grace as you
[SHK] So hung upon with love so fortunate
[SHK] But miserable most to love unloved
[SHK] This you should pity rather than despise
[SHK] I understand not what you mean by this
[SHK] Ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
[SHK] Make mouths upon me when I turn my back
[SHK] Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
[SHK] This sport well carried shall be chronicled
[SHK] If you have any pity grace or manners
[SHK] You would not make me such an argument
[SHK] But fare ye well 't is partly my own fault
[SHK] Which death or absence soon shall remedy
[SHK] Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse
[SHK] My love my life my soul fair Helena
[SHK] O excellent
[SHK] Sweet do not scorn her so
[SHK] If she can not entreat I can compel
[SHK] Thou canst compel no more than she entreat
[SHK] Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
[SHK] Helen I love thee by my life I do
[SHK] I swear by that which I will lose for thee
[SHK] To prove him false that says I love thee not
[SHK] I say I love thee more than he can do
[SHK] If thou say so withdraw and prove it too
[SHK] Quick come
[SHK] Lysander whereto tends all this
[SHK] Away you Ethiope
[SHK] No no he 'll
[SHK] Seem to break loose take on as you would follow
[SHK] But yet come not you are a tame man go
[SHK] Hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
[SHK] Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent
[SHK] Why are you grown so rude what change is this
[SHK] Sweet love --
[SHK] Thy love out tawny Tartar out
[SHK] Out loathed medicine hated potion hence
[SHK] Do you not jest
[SHK] Yes sooth and so do you
[SHK] Demetrius I will keep my word with thee
[SHK] I would I had your bond for I perceive
[SHK] A weak bond holds you I 'll not trust your word
[SHK] What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead
[SHK] Although I hate her I 'll not harm her so
[SHK] What can you do me greater harm than hate
[SHK] Hate me wherefore O me what news my love
[SHK] Am not I Hermia are not you Lysander
[SHK] I am as fair now as I was erewhile
[SHK] Since night you loved me yet since night you left
[SHK] me
[SHK] Why then you left me -- O the gods forbid --
[SHK] In earnest shall I say
[SHK] Ay by my life
[SHK] And never did desire to see thee more
[SHK] Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
[SHK] Be certain nothing truer 't is no jest
[SHK] That I do hate thee and love Helena
[SHK] O me you juggler you canker-blossom
[SHK] You thief of love what have you come by night
[SHK] And stolen my love 's heart from him
[SHK] Fine i'faith
[SHK] Have you no modesty no maiden shame
[SHK] No touch of bashfulness What will you tear
[SHK] Impatient answers from my gentle tongue
[SHK] Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
[SHK] Puppet why so ay that way goes the game
[SHK] Now I perceive that she hath made compare
[SHK] Between our statures she hath urged her height
[SHK] And with her personage her tall personage
[SHK] Her height forsooth she hath prevail 'd with him
[SHK] And are you grown so high in his esteem
[SHK] Because I am so dwarfish and so low
[SHK] How low am I thou painted maypole speak
[SHK] How low am I I am not yet so low
[SHK] But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
[SHK] I pray you though you mock me gentlemen
[SHK] Let her not hurt me I was never curst
[SHK] I have no gift at all in shrewishness
[SHK] I am a right maid for my cowardice
[SHK] Let her not strike me You perhaps may think
[SHK] Because she is something lower than myself
[SHK] That I can match her
[SHK] Lower hark again
[SHK] Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me
[SHK] I evermore did love you Hermia
[SHK] Did ever keep your counsels never wrong 'd you
[SHK] Save that in love unto Demetrius
[SHK] I told him of your stealth unto this wood
[SHK] He follow 'd you for love I follow 'd him
[SHK] But he hath chid me hence and threaten 'd me
[SHK] To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
[SHK] And now so you will let me quiet go
[SHK] To Athens will I bear my folly back
[SHK] And follow you no further let me go
[SHK] You see how simple and how fond I am
[SHK] Why get you gone who is't that hinders you
[SHK] A foolish heart that I leave here behind
[SHK] What with Lysander
[SHK] With Demetrius
[SHK] Be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena
[SHK] No sir she shall not though you take her part
[SHK] O when she 's angry she is keen and shrewd
[SHK] She was a vixen when she went to school
[SHK] And though she be but little she is fierce
[SHK] 'Little again nothing but 'low and 'little
[SHK] Why will you suffer her to flout me thus
[SHK] Let me come to her
[SHK] Get you gone you dwarf
[SHK] You minimus of hindering knot-grass made
[SHK] You bead you acorn
[SHK] You are too officious
[SHK] In her behalf that scorns your services
[SHK] Let her alone speak not of Helena
[SHK] Take not her part for if thou dost intend
[SHK] Never so little show of love to her
[SHK] Thou shalt aby it
[SHK] Now she holds me not
[SHK] Now follow if thou darest to try whose right
[SHK] Of thine or mine is most in Helena
[SHK] Follow nay I 'll go with thee cheek by jole
[SHK] You mistress all this coil is 'long of you
[SHK] Nay go not back
[SHK] I will not trust you I
[SHK] Nor longer stay in your curst company
[SHK] Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
[SHK] My legs are longer though to run away
[SHK] I am amazed and know not what to say
[SHK] This is thy negligence still thou mistakest
[SHK] Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully
[SHK] Believe me king of shadows I mistook
[SHK] Did not you tell me I should know the man
[SHK] By the Athenian garment be had on
[SHK] And so far blameless proves my enterprise
[SHK] That I have 'nointed an Athenian 's eyes
[SHK] And so far am I glad it so did sort
[SHK] As this their jangling I esteem a sport
[SHK] Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight
[SHK] Hie therefore Robin overcast the night
[SHK] The starry welkin cover thou anon
[SHK] With drooping fog as black as Acheron
[SHK] And lead these testy rivals so astray
[SHK] As one come not within another 's way
[SHK] Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue
[SHK] Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong
[SHK] And sometime rail thou like Demetrius
[SHK] And from each other look thou lead them thus
[SHK] Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
[SHK] With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
[SHK] Then crush this herb into Lysander 's eye
[SHK] Whose liquor hath this virtuous property
[SHK] To take from thence all error with his might
[SHK] And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
[SHK] When they next wake all this derision
[SHK] Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
[SHK] And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
[SHK] With league whose date till death shall never end
[SHK] Whiles I in this affair do thee employ
[SHK] I 'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy
[SHK] And then I will her charmed eye release
[SHK] From monster 's view and all things shall be peace
[SHK] My fairy lord this must be done with haste
[SHK] For night 's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
[SHK] And yonder shines Aurora 's harbinger
[SHK] At whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
[SHK] Troop home to churchyards damned spirits all
[SHK] That in crossways and floods have burial
[SHK] Already to their wormy beds are gone
[SHK] For fear lest day should look their shames upon
[SHK] They willfully themselves exile from light
[SHK] And must for aye consort with black-brow 'd night
[SHK] But we are spirits of another sort
[SHK] I with the morning 's love have oft made sport
[SHK] And like a forester the groves may tread
[SHK] Even till the eastern gate all fiery-red
[SHK] Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams
[SHK] Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
[SHK] But notwithstanding haste make no delay
[SHK] We may effect this business yet ere day
[SHK] Up and down up and down
[SHK] I will lead them up and down
[SHK] I am fear 'd in field and town
[SHK] Goblin lead them up and down
[SHK] Here comes one
[SHK] Where art thou proud Demetrius speak thou now
[SHK] Here villain drawn and ready Where art thou
[SHK] I will be with thee straight
[SHK] Follow me then
[SHK] To plainer ground
[SHK] Lysander speak again
[SHK] Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
[SHK] Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head
[SHK] Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
[SHK] Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars
[SHK] And wilt not come Come recreant come thou child
[SHK] I 'll whip thee with a rod he is defiled
[SHK] That draws a sword on thee
[SHK] Yea art thou there
[SHK] Follow my voice we 'll try no manhood here
[SHK] He goes before me and still dares me on
[SHK] When I come where he calls then he is gone
[SHK] The villain is much lighter-heel 'd than I
[SHK] I follow 'd fast but faster he did fly
[SHK] That fallen am I in dark uneven way
[SHK] And here will rest me
[SHK] Come thou gentle day
[SHK] For if but once thou show me thy grey light
[SHK] I 'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite
[SHK] Ho ho ho Coward why comest thou not
[SHK] Abide me if thou darest for well I wot
[SHK] Thou runn'st before me shifting every place
[SHK] And darest not stand nor look me in the face
[SHK] Where art thou now
[SHK] Come hither I am here
[SHK] Nay then thou mock'st me Thou shalt buy this dear
[SHK] If ever I thy face by daylight see
[SHK] Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me
[SHK] To measure out my length on this cold bed
[SHK] By day 's approach look to be visited
[SHK] O weary night O long and tedious night
[SHK] Abate thy hour Shine comforts from the east
[SHK] That I may back to Athens by daylight
[SHK] From these that my poor company detest
[SHK] And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow 's eye
[SHK] Steal me awhile from mine own company
[SHK] Yet but three Come one more
[SHK] Two of both kinds make up four
[SHK] Here she comes curst and sad
[SHK] Cupid is a knavish lad
[SHK] Thus to make poor females mad
[SHK] Never so weary never so in woe
[SHK] Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
[SHK] I can no further crawl no further go
[SHK] My legs can keep no pace with my desires
[SHK] Here will I rest me till the break of day
[SHK] Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
[SHK] On the ground
[SHK] Sleep sound
[SHK] I 'll apply
[SHK] To your eye
[SHK] Gentle lover remedy
[SHK] When thou wakest
[SHK] Thou takest
[SHK] True delight
[SHK] In the sight
[SHK] Of thy former lady 's eye
[SHK] And the country proverb known
[SHK] That every man should take his own
[SHK] In your waking shall be shown
[SHK] Jack shall have Jill
[SHK] Nought shall go ill
[SHK] The man shall have his mare again and all shall be well
[SHK] Come sit thee down upon this flowery bed
[SHK] While I thy amiable cheeks do coy
[SHK] And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head
[SHK] And kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy
[SHK] Where 's Peaseblossom
[SHK] Ready
[SHK] Scratch my head Peaseblossom Where 's Mounsieur Cobweb
[SHK] Ready
[SHK] Mounsieur Cobweb good mounsieur get you your
[SHK] weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped
[SHK] humble-bee on the top of a thistle and good
[SHK] mounsieur bring me the honey-bag Do not fret
[SHK] yourself too much in the action mounsieur and
[SHK] good mounsieur have a care the honey-bag break not
[SHK] I would be loath to have you overflown with a
[SHK] honey-bag signior Where 's Mounsieur Mustardseed
[SHK] Ready
[SHK] Give me your neaf Mounsieur Mustardseed Pray you
[SHK] leave your courtesy good mounsieur
[SHK] What 's your Will
[SHK] Nothing good mounsieur but to help Cavalery Cobweb
[SHK] to scratch I must to the barber 's monsieur for
[SHK] methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face and I
[SHK] am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me
[SHK] I must scratch
[SHK] What wilt thou hear some music
[SHK] my sweet love
[SHK] I have a reasonable good ear in music Let 's have
[SHK] the tongs and the bones
[SHK] Or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat
[SHK] Truly a peck of provender I could munch your good
[SHK] dry oats Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
[SHK] of hay good hay sweet hay hath no fellow
[SHK] I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
[SHK] The squirrel 's hoard and fetch thee new nuts
[SHK] I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas
[SHK] But I pray you let none of your people stir me I
[SHK] have an exposition of sleep come upon me
[SHK] Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms
[SHK] Fairies begone and be all ways away
[SHK] So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
[SHK] Gently entwist the female ivy so
[SHK] Enrings the barky fingers of the elm
[SHK] O how I love thee how I dote on thee
[SHK] See'st thou this sweet sight
[SHK] Her dotage now I do begin to pity
[SHK] For meeting her of late behind the wood
[SHK] Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool
[SHK] I did upbraid her and fall out with her
[SHK] For she his hairy temples then had rounded
[SHK] With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
[SHK] And that same dew which sometime on the buds
[SHK] Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
[SHK] Stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes
[SHK] Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
[SHK] When I had at my pleasure taunted her
[SHK] And she in mild terms begg 'd my patience
[SHK] I then did ask of her her changeling child
[SHK] Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
[SHK] To bear him to my bower in fairy land
[SHK] And now I have the boy I will undo
[SHK] This hateful imperfection of her eyes
[SHK] And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp
[SHK] From off the head of this Athenian swain
[SHK] That he awaking when the other do
[SHK] May all to Athens back again repair
[SHK] And think no more of this night 's accidents
[SHK] But as the fierce vexation of a dream
[SHK] But first I will release the fairy queen
[SHK] Be as thou wast wont to be
[SHK] See as thou wast wont to see
[SHK] Dian 's bud o'er Cupid 's flower
[SHK] Hath such force and blessed power
[SHK] Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen
[SHK] My Oberon what visions have I seen
[SHK] Methought I was enamour 'd of an ass
[SHK] There lies your love
[SHK] How came these things to pass
[SHK] O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
[SHK] Silence awhile Robin take off this head
[SHK] Titania music call and strike more dead
[SHK] Than common sleep of all these five the sense
[SHK] Music ho music such as charmeth sleep
[SHK] Now when thou wakest with thine
[SHK] own fool 's eyes peep
[SHK] Sound music Come my queen take hands with me
[SHK] And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
[SHK] Now thou and I are new in amity
[SHK] And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
[SHK] Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly
[SHK] And bless it to all fair prosperity
[SHK] There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
[SHK] Wedded with Theseus all in jollity
[SHK] Fairy king attend and mark
[SHK] I do hear the morning lark
[SHK] Then my queen in silence sad
[SHK] Trip we after the night 's shade
[SHK] We the globe can compass soon
[SHK] Swifter than the wandering moon
[SHK] Come my lord and in our flight
[SHK] Tell me how it came this night
[SHK] That I sleeping here was found
[SHK] With these mortals on the ground
[SHK] Go one of you find out the forester
[SHK] For now our observation is perform 'd
[SHK] And since we have the vaward of the day
[SHK] My love shall hear the music of my hounds
[SHK] Uncouple in the western valley let them go
[SHK] Dispatch I say and find the forester
[SHK] We will fair queen up to the mountain 's top
[SHK] And mark the musical confusion
[SHK] Of hounds and echo in conjunction
[SHK] I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
[SHK] When in a wood of Crete they bay 'd the bear
[SHK] With hounds of Sparta never did I hear
[SHK] Such gallant chiding for besides the groves
[SHK] The skies the fountains every region near
[SHK] Seem 'd all one mutual cry I never heard
[SHK] So musical a discord such sweet thunder
[SHK] My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind
[SHK] So flew 'd so sanded and their heads are hung
[SHK] With ears that sweep away the morning dew
[SHK] Crook-knee 'd and dew-lapp 'd like Thessalian bulls
[SHK] Slow in pursuit but match 'd in mouth like bells
[SHK] Each under each A cry more tuneable
[SHK] Was never holla 'd to nor cheer 'd with horn
[SHK] In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly
[SHK] Judge when you hear But soft what nymphs are these
[SHK] My lord this is my daughter here asleep
[SHK] And this Lysander this Demetrius is
[SHK] This Helena old Nedar 's Helena
[SHK] I wonder of their being here together
[SHK] No doubt they rose up early to observe
[SHK] The rite of May and hearing our intent
[SHK] Came here in grace our solemnity
[SHK] But speak Egeus is not this the day
[SHK] That Hermia should give answer of her choice
[SHK] It is my lord
[SHK] Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
[SHK] Good morrow friends Saint Valentine is past
[SHK] Begin these wood-birds but to couple now
[SHK] Pardon my lord
[SHK] I pray you all stand up
[SHK] I know you two are rival enemies
[SHK] How comes this gentle concord in the world
[SHK] That hatred is so far from jealousy
[SHK] To sleep by hate and fear no enmity
[SHK] My lord I shall reply amazedly
[SHK] Half sleep half waking but as yet I swear
[SHK] I can not truly say how I came here
[SHK] But as I think -- for truly would I speak
[SHK] And now do I bethink me so it is --
[SHK] I came with Hermia hither our intent
[SHK] Was to be gone from Athens where we might
[SHK] Without the peril of the Athenian law
[SHK] Enough enough my lord you have enough
[SHK] I beg the law the law upon his head
[SHK] They would have stolen away they would Demetrius
[SHK] Thereby to have defeated you and me
[SHK] You of your wife and me of my consent
[SHK] Of my consent that she should be your wife
[SHK] My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth
[SHK] Of this their purpose hither to this wood
[SHK] And I in fury hither follow 'd them
[SHK] Fair Helena in fancy following me
[SHK] But my good lord I wot not by what power --
[SHK] But by some power it is -- my love to Hermia
[SHK] Melted as the snow seems to me now
[SHK] As the remembrance of an idle gaud
[SHK] Which in my childhood I did dote upon
[SHK] And all the faith the virtue of my heart
[SHK] The object and the pleasure of mine eye
[SHK] Is only Helena To her my lord
[SHK] Was I betroth 'd ere I saw Hermia
[SHK] But like in sickness did I loathe this food
[SHK] But as in health come to my natural taste
[SHK] Now I do wish it love it long for it
[SHK] And will for evermore be true to it
[SHK] Fair lovers you are fortunately met
[SHK] Of this discourse we more will hear anon
[SHK] Egeus I will overbear your will
[SHK] For in the temple by and by with us
[SHK] These couples shall eternally be knit
[SHK] And for the morning now is something worn
[SHK] Our purposed hunting shall be set aside
[SHK] Away with us to Athens three and three
[SHK] We 'll hold a feast in great solemnity
[SHK] Come Hippolyta
[SHK] These things seem small and undistinguishable
[SHK] Methinks I see these things with parted eye
[SHK] When every thing seems double
[SHK] So methinks
[SHK] And I have found Demetrius like a jewel
[SHK] Mine own and not mine own
[SHK] Are you sure
[SHK] That we are awake It seems to me
[SHK] That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think
[SHK] The duke was here and bid us follow him
[SHK] Yea and my father
[SHK] And Hippolyta
[SHK] And he did bid us follow to the temple
[SHK] Why then we are awake let 's follow him
[SHK] And by the way let us recount our dreams
[SHK] answer my next is 'Most fair Pyramus Heigh-ho
[SHK] Peter Quince Flute the bellows-mender Snout
[SHK] the tinker Starveling God 's my life stolen
[SHK] hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare
[SHK] vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to
[SHK] say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go
[SHK] about to expound this dream Methought I was -- there
[SHK] is no man can tell what Methought I was -- and
[SHK] methought I had -- but man is but a patched fool if
[SHK] he will offer to say what methought I had The eye
[SHK] of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not
[SHK] seen man 's hand is not able to taste his tongue
[SHK] to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream
[SHK] was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
[SHK] this dream it shall be called Bottom 's Dream
[SHK] because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the
[SHK] latter end of a play before the duke
[SHK] peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall
[SHK] sing it at her death
[SHK] Have you sent to Bottom 's house is he come home yet
[SHK] He can not be heard of Out of doubt he is
[SHK] transported
[SHK] If he come not then the play is marred it goes
[SHK] not forward doth it
[SHK] It is not possible you have not a man in all
[SHK] Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he
[SHK] No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
[SHK] man in Athens
[SHK] Yea and the best person too and he is a very
[SHK] paramour for a sweet voice
[SHK] You must say 'paragon a paramour is God bless us
[SHK] a thing of naught
[SHK] Masters the duke is coming from the temple and
[SHK] there is two or three lords and ladies more married
[SHK] if our sport had gone forward we had all been made
[SHK] men
[SHK] O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a
[SHK] day during his life he could not have 'scaped
[SHK] sixpence a day an the duke had not given him
[SHK] sixpence a day for playing Pyramus I 'll be hanged
[SHK] he would have deserved it sixpence a day in
[SHK] Pyramus or nothing
[SHK] Where are these lads where are these hearts
[SHK] Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour
[SHK] Masters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not
[SHK] what for if I tell you I am no true Athenian I
[SHK] will tell you every thing right as it fell out
[SHK] Let us hear sweet Bottom
[SHK] Not a word of me All that I will tell you is that
[SHK] the duke hath dined Get your apparel together
[SHK] good strings to your beards new ribbons to your
[SHK] pumps meet presently at the palace every man look
[SHK] o'er his part for the short and the long is our
[SHK] play is preferred In any case let Thisby have
[SHK] clean linen and let not him that plays the lion
[SHK] pair his nails for they shall hang out for the
[SHK] lion 's claws And most dear actors eat no onions
[SHK] nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I
[SHK] do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet
[SHK] comedy No more words away go away
[SHK] 'T is strange my Theseus that these
[SHK] lovers speak of
[SHK] More strange than true I never may believe
[SHK] These antique fables nor these fairy toys
[SHK] Lovers and madmen have such seething brains
[SHK] Such shaping fantasies that apprehend
[SHK] More than cool reason ever comprehends
[SHK] The lunatic the lover and the poet
[SHK] Are of imagination all compact
[SHK] One sees more devils than vast hell can hold
[SHK] That is the madman the lover all as frantic
[SHK] Sees Helen 's beauty in a brow of Egypt
[SHK] The poet 's eye in fine frenzy rolling
[SHK] Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
[SHK] And as imagination bodies forth
[SHK] The forms of things unknown the poet 's pen
[SHK] Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
[SHK] A local habitation and a name
[SHK] Such tricks hath strong imagination
[SHK] That if it would but apprehend some joy
[SHK] It comprehends some bringer of that joy
[SHK] Or in the night imagining some fear
[SHK] How easy is a bush supposed a bear
[SHK] But all the story of the night told over
[SHK] And all their minds transfigured so together
[SHK] More witnesseth than fancy 's images
[SHK] And grows to something of great constancy
[SHK] But howsoever strange and admirable
[SHK] Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
[SHK] Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
[SHK] Accompany your hearts
[SHK] More than to us
[SHK] Wait in your royal walks your board your bed
[SHK] Come now what masques what dances shall we have
[SHK] To wear away this long age of three hours
[SHK] Between our after-supper and bed-time
[SHK] Where is our usual manager of mirth
[SHK] What revels are in hand Is there no play
[SHK] To ease the anguish of a torturing hour
[SHK] Call Philostrate
[SHK] Here mighty Theseus
[SHK] Say what abridgement have you for this evening
[SHK] What masque what music How shall we beguile
[SHK] The lazy time if not with some delight
[SHK] There is a brief how many sports are ripe
[SHK] Make choice of which your highness will see first
[SHK] By an Athenian eunuch to the harp
[SHK] We 'll none of that that have I told my love
[SHK] In glory of my kinsman Hercules
[SHK] 'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals
[SHK] Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage
[SHK] That is an old device and it was play 'd
[SHK] When I from Thebes came last a conqueror
[SHK] 'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
[SHK] Of Learning late deceased in beggary
[SHK] That is some satire keen and critical
[SHK] Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
[SHK] A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
[SHK] And his love Thisbe very tragical mirth
[SHK] Merry and tragical tedious and brief
[SHK] That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
[SHK] How shall we find the concord of this discord
[SHK] A play there is my lord some ten words long
[SHK] Which is as brief as I have known a play
[SHK] But by ten words my lord it is too long
[SHK] Which makes it tedious for in all the play
[SHK] There is not one word apt one player fitted
[SHK] And tragical my noble lord it is
[SHK] For Pyramus therein doth kill himself
[SHK] Which when I saw rehearsed I must confess
[SHK] Made mine eyes water but more merry tears
[SHK] The passion of loud laughter never shed
[SHK] What are they that do play it
[SHK] Hard-handed men that work in Athens here
[SHK] Which never labour 'd in their minds till now
[SHK] And now have toil 'd their unbreathed memories
[SHK] With this same play against your nuptial
[SHK] And we will hear it
[SHK] No my noble lord
[SHK] It is not for you I have heard it over
[SHK] And it is nothing nothing in the world
[SHK] Unless you can find sport in their intents
[SHK] Extremely stretch 'd and conn 'd with cruel pain
[SHK] To do you service
[SHK] I will hear that play
[SHK] For never anything can be amiss
[SHK] When simpleness and duty tender it
[SHK] Go bring them in and take your places ladies
[SHK] I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
[SHK] And duty in his service perishing
[SHK] Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
[SHK] He says they can do nothing in this kind
[SHK] The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
[SHK] Our sport shall be to take what they mistake
[SHK] And what poor duty can not do noble respect
[SHK] Takes it in might not merit
[SHK] Where I have come great clerks have purposed
[SHK] To greet me with premeditated welcomes
[SHK] Where I have seen them shiver and look pale
[SHK] Make periods in the midst of sentences
[SHK] Throttle their practised accent in their fears
[SHK] And in conclusion dumbly have broke off
[SHK] Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet
[SHK] Out of this silence yet I pick 'd a welcome
[SHK] And in the modesty of fearful duty
[SHK] I read as much as from the rattling tongue
[SHK] Of saucy and audacious eloquence
[SHK] Love therefore and tongue-tied simplicity
[SHK] In least speak most to my capacity
[SHK] So please your grace the Prologue is address 'd
[SHK] Let him approach
[SHK] If we offend it is with our good will
[SHK] That you should think we come not to offend
[SHK] But with good will To show our simple skill
[SHK] That is the true beginning of our end
[SHK] Consider then we come but in despite
[SHK] We do not come as minding to contest you
[SHK] Our true intent is All for your delight
[SHK] We are not here That you should here repent you
[SHK] The actors are at hand and by their show
[SHK] You shall know all that you are like to know
[SHK] This fellow doth not stand upon points
[SHK] He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows
[SHK] not the stop A good moral my lord it is not
[SHK] enough to speak but to speak true
[SHK] Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
[SHK] on a recorder a sound but not in government
[SHK] His speech was like a tangled chain nothing
[SHK] impaired but all disordered Who is next
[SHK] Gentles perchance you wonder at this show
[SHK] But wonder on till truth make all things plain
[SHK] This man is Pyramus if you would know
[SHK] This beauteous lady Thisby is certain
[SHK] This man with lime and rough-cast doth present
[SHK] Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder
[SHK] And through Wall 's chink poor souls they are content
[SHK] To whisper At the which let no man wonder
[SHK] This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
[SHK] Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know
[SHK] By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
[SHK] To meet at Ninus tomb there there to woo
[SHK] This grisly beast which Lion hight by name
[SHK] The trusty Thisby coming first by night
[SHK] Did scare away or rather did affright
[SHK] And as she fled her mantle she did fall
[SHK] Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
[SHK] Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall
[SHK] And finds his trusty Thisby 's mantle slain
[SHK] Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
[SHK] He bravely broach 'd is boiling bloody breast
[SHK] And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
[SHK] His dagger drew and died For all the rest
[SHK] Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain
[SHK] At large discourse while here they do remain
[SHK] I wonder if the lion be to speak
[SHK] No wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
[SHK] In this same interlude it doth befall
[SHK] That I one Snout by name present a wall
[SHK] And such a wall as I would have you think
[SHK] That had in it a crannied hole or chink
[SHK] Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby
[SHK] Did whisper often very secretly
[SHK] This loam this rough-cast and this stone doth show
[SHK] That I am that same wall the truth is so
[SHK] And this the cranny is right and sinister
[SHK] Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
[SHK] Would you desire lime and hair to speak better
[SHK] It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
[SHK] discourse my lord
[SHK] Pyramus draws near the wall silence
[SHK] O grim-look 'd night O night with hue so black
[SHK] O night which ever art when day is not
[SHK] O night O night alack alack alack
[SHK] I fear my Thisby 's promise is forgot
[SHK] And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall
[SHK] That stand'st between her father 's ground and mine
[SHK] Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall
[SHK] Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
[SHK] Thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this
[SHK] But what see I No Thisby do I see
[SHK] O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss
[SHK] Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
[SHK] The wall methinks being sensible should curse again
[SHK] No in truth sir he should not 'Deceiving me
[SHK] is Thisby 's cue she is to enter now and I am to
[SHK] spy her through the wall You shall see it will
[SHK] fall pat as I told you Yonder she comes
[SHK] O wall full often hast thou heard my moans
[SHK] For parting my fair Pyramus and me
[SHK] My cherry lips have often kiss 'd thy stones
[SHK] Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
[SHK] I see a voice now will I to the chink
[SHK] To spy an I can hear my Thisby 's face Thisby
[SHK] My love thou art my love I think
[SHK] Think what thou wilt I am thy lover 's grace
[SHK] And like Limander am I trusty still
[SHK] And I like Helen till the Fates me kill
[SHK] Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
[SHK] As Shafalus to Procrus I to you
[SHK] O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
[SHK] I kiss the wall 's hole not your lips at all
[SHK] Wilt thou at Ninny 's tomb meet me straightway
[SHK] 'Tide life 'tide death I come without delay
[SHK] Thus have I Wall my part discharged so
[SHK] And being done thus Wall away doth go
[SHK] Now is the mural down between the two neighbours
[SHK] No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
[SHK] without warning
[SHK] This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard
[SHK] The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst
[SHK] are no worse if imagination amend them
[SHK] It must be your imagination then and not theirs
[SHK] If we imagine no worse of them than they of
[SHK] themselves they may pass for excellent men Here
[SHK] come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
[SHK] You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
[SHK] The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
[SHK] May now perchance both quake and tremble here
[SHK] When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
[SHK] Then know that I one Snug the joiner am
[SHK] A lion-fell nor else no lion 's dam
[SHK] For if I should as lion come in strife
[SHK] Into this place 'twere pity on my life
[SHK] A very gentle beast of a good conscience
[SHK] The very best at a beast my lord that e'er I saw
[SHK] This lion is a very fox for his valour
[SHK] True and a goose for his discretion
[SHK] Not so my lord for his valour can not carry his
[SHK] discretion and the fox carries the goose
[SHK] His discretion I am sure can not carry his valour
[SHK] for the goose carries not the fox It is well
[SHK] leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
[SHK] This lanthorn doth the horned moon present --
[SHK] He should have worn the horns on his head
[SHK] He is no crescent and his horns are
[SHK] invisible within the circumference
[SHK] This lanthorn doth the horned moon present
[SHK] Myself the man i the moon do seem to be
[SHK] This is the greatest error of all the rest the man
[SHK] should be put into the lanthorn How is it else the
[SHK] man i the moon
[SHK] He dares not come there for the candle for you
[SHK] see it is already in snuff
[SHK] I am aweary of this moon would he would change
[SHK] It appears by his small light of discretion that
[SHK] he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all
[SHK] reason we must stay the time
[SHK] Proceed Moon
[SHK] All that I have to say is to tell you that the
[SHK] lanthorn is the moon I the man in the moon this
[SHK] thorn-bush my thorn-bush and this dog my dog
[SHK] Why all these should be in the lanthorn for all
[SHK] these are in the moon But silence here comes Thisbe
[SHK] This is old Ninny 's tomb Where is my love
[SHK] Well roared Lion
[SHK] Well run Thisbe
[SHK] Well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a
[SHK] good grace
[SHK] Well moused Lion
[SHK] And so the lion vanished
[SHK] And then came Pyramus
[SHK] Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams
[SHK] I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright
[SHK] For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
[SHK] I trust to take of truest Thisby sight
[SHK] But stay O spite
[SHK] But mark poor knight
[SHK] What dreadful dole is here
[SHK] Eyes do you see
[SHK] How can it be
[SHK] O dainty duck O dear
[SHK] Thy mantle good
[SHK] What stain 'd with blood
[SHK] Approach ye Furies fell
[SHK] O Fates come come
[SHK] Cut thread and thrum
[SHK] Quail crush conclude and quell
[SHK] This passion and the death of a dear friend would
[SHK] go near to make a man look sad
[SHK] Beshrew my heart but I pity the man
[SHK] O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame
[SHK] Since lion vile hath here deflower 'd my dear
[SHK] Which is -- no no -- which was the fairest dame
[SHK] That lived that loved that liked that look 'd
[SHK] with cheer
[SHK] Come tears confound
[SHK] Out sword and wound
[SHK] The pap of Pyramus
[SHK] Ay that left pap
[SHK] Where heart doth hop
[SHK] Thus die I thus thus thus
[SHK] Now am I dead
[SHK] Now am I fled
[SHK] My soul is in the sky
[SHK] Tongue lose thy light
[SHK] Moon take thy flight
[SHK] Now die die die die die
[SHK] No die but an ace for him for he is but one
[SHK] Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
[SHK] With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and
[SHK] prove an ass
[SHK] How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
[SHK] back and finds her lover
[SHK] She will find him by starlight Here she comes and
[SHK] her passion ends the play
[SHK] Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
[SHK] Pyramus I hope she will be brief
[SHK] A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which
[SHK] Thisbe is the better he for a man God warrant us
[SHK] she for a woman God bless us
[SHK] She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
[SHK] And thus she means videlicet --
[SHK] Asleep my love
[SHK] What dead my dove
[SHK] O Pyramus arise
[SHK] Speak speak Quite dumb
[SHK] Dead dead A tomb
[SHK] Must cover thy sweet eyes
[SHK] These My lips
[SHK] This cherry nose
[SHK] These yellow cowslip cheeks
[SHK] Are gone are gone
[SHK] Lovers make moan
[SHK] His eyes were green as leeks
[SHK] O Sisters Three
[SHK] Come come to me
[SHK] With hands as pale as milk
[SHK] Lay them in gore
[SHK] Since you have shore
[SHK] With shears his thread of silk
[SHK] Tongue not a word
[SHK] Come trusty sword
[SHK] Come blade my breast imbrue
[SHK] And farewell friends
[SHK] Thus Thisby ends
[SHK] Adieu adieu adieu
[SHK] Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
[SHK] Ay and Wall too
[SHK] parted their fathers Will it please you to see the
[SHK] epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
[SHK] of our company
[SHK] No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no
[SHK] excuse Never excuse for when the players are all
[SHK] dead there needs none to be blamed Marry if he
[SHK] that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
[SHK] in Thisbe 's garter it would have been a fine
[SHK] tragedy and so it is truly and very notably
[SHK] discharged But come your Bergomask let your
[SHK] epilogue alone
[SHK] The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
[SHK] Lovers to bed 't is almost fairy time
[SHK] I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
[SHK] As much as we this night have overwatch 'd
[SHK] This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
[SHK] The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed
[SHK] A fortnight hold we this solemnity
[SHK] In nightly revels and new jollity
[SHK] Now the hungry lion roars
[SHK] And the wolf behowls the moon
[SHK] Whilst the heavy ploughman snores
[SHK] All with weary task fordone
[SHK] Now the wasted brands do glow
[SHK] Whilst the screech-owl screeching loud
[SHK] Puts the wretch that lies in woe
[SHK] In remembrance of a shroud
[SHK] Now it is the time of night
[SHK] That the graves all gaping wide
[SHK] Every one lets forth his sprite
[SHK] In the church-way paths to glide
[SHK] And we fairies that do run
[SHK] By the triple Hecate 's team
[SHK] From the presence of the sun
[SHK] Following darkness like a dream
[SHK] Now are frolic not a mouse
[SHK] Shall disturb this hallow 'd house
[SHK] I am sent with broom before
[SHK] To sweep the dust behind the door
[SHK] Through the house give gathering light
[SHK] By the dead and drowsy fire
[SHK] Every elf and fairy sprite
[SHK] Hop as light as bird from brier
[SHK] And this ditty after me
[SHK] Sing and dance it trippingly
[SHK] First rehearse your song by rote
[SHK] To each word a warbling note
[SHK] Hand in hand with fairy grace
[SHK] Will we sing and bless this place
[SHK] Now until the break of day
[SHK] Through this house each fairy stray
[SHK] To the best bride-bed will we
[SHK] Which by us shall blessed be
[SHK] And the issue there create
[SHK] Ever shall be fortunate
[SHK] So shall all the couples three
[SHK] Ever true in loving be
[SHK] And the blots of Nature 's hand
[SHK] Shall not in their issue stand
[SHK] Never mole hare lip nor scar
[SHK] Nor mark prodigious such as are
[SHK] Despised in nativity
[SHK] Shall upon their children be
[SHK] With this field-dew consecrate
[SHK] Every fairy take his gait
[SHK] And each several chamber bless
[SHK] Through this palace with sweet peace
[SHK] And the owner of it blest
[SHK] Ever shall in safety rest
[SHK] Trip away make no stay
[SHK] Meet me all by break of day
[SHK] If we shadows have offended
[SHK] Think but this and all is mended
[SHK] That you have but slumber 'd here
[SHK] While these visions did appear
[SHK] And this weak and idle theme
[SHK] No more yielding but a dream
[SHK] Gentles do not reprehend
[SHK] if you pardon we will mend
[SHK] And as I am an honest Puck
[SHK] If we have unearned luck
[SHK] Now to 'scape the serpent 's tongue
[SHK] We will make amends ere long
[SHK] Else the Puck a liar call
[SHK] So good night unto you all
[SHK] Give me your hands if we be friends
[SHK] And Robin shall restore amends
[SHK] Who 's there
[SHK] Nay answer me stand and unfold yourself
[SHK] Long live the king
[SHK] Bernardo
[SHK] He
[SHK] You come most carefully upon your hour
[SHK] 'T is now struck twelve get thee to bed Francisco
[SHK] For this relief much thanks 't is bitter cold
[SHK] And I am sick at heart
[SHK] Have you had quiet guard
[SHK] Not a mouse stirring
[SHK] Well good night
[SHK] If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus
[SHK] The rivals of my watch bid them make haste
[SHK] I think I hear them Stand ho Who 's there
[SHK] Friends to this ground
[SHK] And liegemen to the Dane
[SHK] Give you good night
[SHK] O farewell honest soldier
[SHK] Who hath relieved you
[SHK] Bernardo has my place
[SHK] Give you good night
[SHK] Holla Bernardo
[SHK] Say
[SHK] What is Horatio there
[SHK] A piece of him
[SHK] Welcome Horatio welcome good Marcellus
[SHK] What has this thing appear 'd again to-night
[SHK] I have seen nothing
[SHK] Horatio says 't is but our fantasy
[SHK] And will not let belief take hold of him
[SHK] Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
[SHK] Therefore I have entreated him along
[SHK] With us to watch the minutes of this night
[SHK] That if again this apparition come
[SHK] He may approve our eyes and speak to it
[SHK] Tush tush 'twill not appear
[SHK] Sit down awhile
[SHK] And let us once again assail your ears
[SHK] That are so fortified against our story
[SHK] What we have two nights seen
[SHK] Well sit we down
[SHK] And let us hear Bernardo speak of this
[SHK] Last night of all
[SHK] When yond same star that 's westward from the pole
[SHK] Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
[SHK] Where now it burns Marcellus and myself
[SHK] The bell then beating one --
[SHK] Peace break thee off look where it comes again
[SHK] In the same figure like the king that 's dead
[SHK] Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio
[SHK] Looks it not like the king mark it Horatio
[SHK] Most like it harrows me with fear and wonder
[SHK] It would be spoke to
[SHK] Question it Horatio
[SHK] What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
[SHK] Together with that fair and warlike form
[SHK] In which the majesty of buried Denmark
[SHK] Did sometimes march by heaven I charge thee speak
[SHK] It is offended
[SHK] See it stalks away
[SHK] Stay speak speak I charge thee speak
[SHK] 'T is gone and will not answer
[SHK] How now Horatio you tremble and look pale
[SHK] Is not this something more than fantasy
[SHK] What think you o n't
[SHK] Before my God I might not this believe
[SHK] Without the sensible and true avouch
[SHK] Of mine own eyes
[SHK] Is it not like the king
[SHK] As thou art to thyself
[SHK] Such was the very armour he had on
[SHK] When he the ambitious Norway combated
[SHK] So frown 'd he once when in an angry parle
[SHK] He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
[SHK] 'T is strange
[SHK] Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
[SHK] With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
[SHK] In what particular thought to work I know not
[SHK] But in the gross and scope of my opinion
[SHK] This bodes some strange eruption to our state
[SHK] Good now sit down and tell me he that knows
[SHK] Why this same strict and most observant watch
[SHK] So nightly toils the subject of the land
[SHK] And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
[SHK] And foreign mart for implements of war
[SHK] Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
[SHK] Does not divide the Sunday from the week
[SHK] What might be toward that this sweaty haste
[SHK] Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day
[SHK] Who is't that can inform me
[SHK] That can I
[SHK] At least the whisper goes so Our last king
[SHK] Whose image even but now appear 'd to us
[SHK] Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
[SHK] Thereto prick 'd on by a most emulate pride
[SHK] Dared to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet --
[SHK] For so this side of our known world esteem 'd him --
[SHK] Did slay this Fortinbras who by a seal 'd compact
[SHK] Well ratified by law and heraldry
[SHK] Did forfeit with his life all those his lands
[SHK] Which he stood seized of to the conqueror
[SHK] Against the which a moiety competent
[SHK] Was gaged by our king which had return 'd
[SHK] To the inheritance of Fortinbras
[SHK] Had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant
[SHK] And carriage of the article design 'd
[SHK] His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
[SHK] Of unimproved mettle hot and full
[SHK] Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
[SHK] Shark 'd up a list of lawless resolutes
[SHK] For food and diet to some enterprise
[SHK] That hath a stomach i n't which is no other --
[SHK] As it doth well appear unto our state --
[SHK] But to recover of us by strong hand
[SHK] And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
[SHK] So by his father lost and this I take it
[SHK] Is the main motive of our preparations
[SHK] The source of this our watch and the chief head
[SHK] Of this post-haste and romage in the land
[SHK] I think it be no other but e'en so
[SHK] Well may it sort that this portentous figure
[SHK] Comes armed through our watch so like the king
[SHK] That was and is the question of these wars
[SHK] A mote it is to trouble the mind 's eye
[SHK] In the most high and palmy state of Rome
[SHK] A little ere the mightiest Julius fell
[SHK] The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
[SHK] Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
[SHK] As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
[SHK] Disasters in the sun and the moist star
[SHK] Upon whose influence Neptune 's empire stands
[SHK] Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
[SHK] And even the like precurse of fierce events
[SHK] As harbingers preceding still the fates
[SHK] And prologue to the omen coming on
[SHK] Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
[SHK] Unto our climatures and countrymen. --
[SHK] But soft behold lo where it comes again
[SHK] I 'll cross it though it blast me Stay illusion
[SHK] If thou hast any sound or use of voice
[SHK] Speak to me
[SHK] If there be any good thing to be done
[SHK] That may to thee do ease and grace to me
[SHK] Speak to me
[SHK] If thou art privy to thy country 's fate
[SHK] Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak
[SHK] Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
[SHK] Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
[SHK] For which they say you spirits oft walk in death
[SHK] Speak of it stay and speak Stop it Marcellus
[SHK] Shall I strike at it with my partisan
[SHK] Do if it will not stand
[SHK] 'T is here
[SHK] 'T is here
[SHK] 'T is gone
[SHK] We do it wrong being so majestical
[SHK] To offer it the show of violence
[SHK] For it is as the air invulnerable
[SHK] And our vain blows malicious mockery
[SHK] It was about to speak when the cock crew
[SHK] And then it started like a guilty thing
[SHK] Upon a fearful summons I have heard
[SHK] The cock that is the trumpet to the morn
[SHK] Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
[SHK] Awake the god of day and at his warning
[SHK] Whether in sea or fire in earth or air
[SHK] The extravagant and erring spirit hies
[SHK] To his confine and of the truth herein
[SHK] This present object made probation
[SHK] It faded on the crowing of the cock
[SHK] Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
[SHK] Wherein our Saviour 's birth is celebrated
[SHK] The bird of dawning singeth all night long
[SHK] And then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
[SHK] The nights are wholesome then no planets strike
[SHK] No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
[SHK] So hallow 'd and so gracious is the time
[SHK] So have I heard and do in part believe it
[SHK] But look the morn in russet mantle clad
[SHK] Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill
[SHK] Break we our watch up and by my advice
[SHK] Let us impart what we have seen to-night
[SHK] Unto young Hamlet for upon my life
[SHK] This spirit dumb to us will speak to him
[SHK] Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
[SHK] As needful in our loves fitting our duty
[SHK] Let 's do't I pray and I this morning know
[SHK] Where we shall find him most conveniently
[SHK] Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother 's death
[SHK] The memory be green and that it us befitted
[SHK] To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
[SHK] To be contracted in one brow of woe
[SHK] Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
[SHK] That we with wisest sorrow think on him
[SHK] Together with remembrance of ourselves
[SHK] Therefore our sometime sister now our queen
[SHK] The imperial jointress to this warlike state
[SHK] Have we as 'twere with a defeated joy --
[SHK] With an auspicious and a dropping eye
[SHK] With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
[SHK] In equal scale weighing delight and dole --
[SHK] Taken to wife nor have we herein barr 'd
[SHK] Your better wisdoms which have freely gone
[SHK] With this affair along For all our thanks
[SHK] Now follows that you know young Fortinbras
[SHK] Holding a weak supposal of our worth
[SHK] Or thinking by our late dear brother 's death
[SHK] Our state to be disjoint and out of frame
[SHK] Colleagued with the dream of his advantage
[SHK] He hath not fail 'd to pester us with message
[SHK] Importing the surrender of those lands
[SHK] Lost by his father with all bonds of law
[SHK] To our most valiant brother So much for him
[SHK] Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
[SHK] Thus much the business is we have here writ
[SHK] To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras --
[SHK] Who impotent and bed-rid scarcely hears
[SHK] Of this his nephew 's purpose -- to suppress
[SHK] His further gait herein in that the levies
[SHK] The lists and full proportions are all made
[SHK] Out of his subject and we here dispatch
[SHK] You good Cornelius and you Voltimand
[SHK] For bearers of this greeting to old Norway
[SHK] Giving to you no further personal power
[SHK] To business with the king more than the scope
[SHK] Of these delated articles allow
[SHK] Farewell and let your haste commend your duty
[SHK] In that and all things will we show our duty
[SHK] We doubt it nothing heartily farewell
[SHK] And now Laertes what 's the news with you
[SHK] You told us of some suit what is't Laertes
[SHK] You can not speak of reason to the Dane
[SHK] And loose your voice what wouldst thou beg Laertes
[SHK] That shall not be my offer not thy asking
[SHK] The head is not more native to the heart
[SHK] The hand more instrumental to the mouth
[SHK] Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
[SHK] What wouldst thou have Laertes
[SHK] My dread lord
[SHK] Your leave and favour to return to France
[SHK] From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
[SHK] To show my duty in your coronation
[SHK] Yet now I must confess that duty done
[SHK] My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
[SHK] And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
[SHK] Have you your father 's leave What says Polonius
[SHK] He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
[SHK] By laboursome petition and at last
[SHK] Upon his will I seal 'd my hard consent
[SHK] I do beseech you give him leave to go
[SHK] Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine
[SHK] And thy best graces spend it at thy will
[SHK] But now my cousin Hamlet and my son --
[SHK] How is it that the clouds still hang on you
[SHK] Not so my lord I am too much i the sun
[SHK] Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
[SHK] And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
[SHK] Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
[SHK] Seek for thy noble father in the dust
[SHK] Thou know'st 't is common all that lives must die
[SHK] Passing through nature to eternity
[SHK] Ay madam it is common
[SHK] If it be
[SHK] Why seems it so particular with thee
[SHK] Seems madam nay it is I know not 'seems
[SHK] 'T is not alone my inky cloak good mother
[SHK] Nor customary suits of solemn black
[SHK] Nor windy suspiration of forced breath
[SHK] No nor the fruitful river in the eye
[SHK] Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage
[SHK] Together with all forms moods shapes of grief
[SHK] That can denote me truly these indeed seem
[SHK] For they are actions that a man might play
[SHK] But I have that within which passeth show
[SHK] These but the trappings and the suits of woe
[SHK] 'T is sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet
[SHK] To give these mourning duties to your father
[SHK] But you must know your father lost a father
[SHK] That father lost lost his and the survivor bound
[SHK] In filial obligation for some term
[SHK] To do obsequious sorrow but to persever
[SHK] In obstinate condolement is a course
[SHK] Of impious stubbornness 't is unmanly grief
[SHK] It shows a will most incorrect to heaven
[SHK] A heart unfortified a mind impatient
[SHK] An understanding simple and unschool 'd
[SHK] For what we know must be and is as common
[SHK] As any the most vulgar thing to sense
[SHK] Why should we in our peevish opposition
[SHK] Take it to heart Fie 't is a fault to heaven
[SHK] A fault against the dead a fault to nature
[SHK] To reason most absurd whose common theme
[SHK] Is death of fathers and who still hath cried
[SHK] From the first corse till he that died to-day
[SHK] 'This must be so We pray you throw to earth
[SHK] This unprevailing woe and think of us
[SHK] As of a father for let the world take note
[SHK] You are the most immediate to our throne
[SHK] And with no less nobility of love
[SHK] Than that which dearest father bears his son
[SHK] Do I impart toward you For your intent
[SHK] In going back to school in Wittenberg
[SHK] It is most retrograde to our desire
[SHK] And we beseech you bend you to remain
[SHK] Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
[SHK] Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
[SHK] Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
[SHK] I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg
[SHK] I shall in all my best obey you madam
[SHK] Why 't is a loving and a fair reply
[SHK] Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come
[SHK] This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
[SHK] Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
[SHK] No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
[SHK] But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
[SHK] And the king 's rouse the heavens all bruit again
[SHK] Re-speaking earthly thunder Come away
[SHK] O that this too too solid flesh would melt
[SHK] Thaw and resolve itself into a dew
[SHK] Or that the Everlasting had not fix 'd
[SHK] His canon 'gainst self-slaughter O God God
[SHK] How weary stale flat and unprofitable
[SHK] Seem to me all the uses of this world
[SHK] Fie o n't ah fie 't is an unweeded garden
[SHK] That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
[SHK] Possess it merely That it should come to this
[SHK] But two months dead nay not so much not two
[SHK] So excellent a king that was to this
[SHK] Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
[SHK] That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
[SHK] Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth
[SHK] Must I remember why she would hang on him
[SHK] As if increase of appetite had grown
[SHK] By what it fed on and yet within a month --
[SHK] Let me not think o n't -- Frailty thy name is woman --
[SHK] A little month or ere those shoes were old
[SHK] With which she follow 'd my poor father 's body
[SHK] Like Niobe all tears -- why she even she --
[SHK] O God a beast that wants discourse of reason
[SHK] Would have mourn 'd longer -- married with my uncle
[SHK] My father 's brother but no more like my father
[SHK] Than I to Hercules within a month
[SHK] Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
[SHK] Had left the flushing in her galled eyes
[SHK] She married O most wicked speed to post
[SHK] With such dexterity to incestuous sheets
[SHK] It is not nor it can not come to good
[SHK] But break my heart for I must hold my tongue
[SHK] Hail to your lordship
[SHK] I am glad to see you well
[SHK] Horatio -- or I do forget myself
[SHK] The same my lord and your poor servant ever
[SHK] Sir my good friend I 'll change that name with you
[SHK] And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio Marcellus
[SHK] My good lord --
[SHK] I am very glad to see you Good even sir
[SHK] But what in faith make you from Wittenberg
[SHK] A truant disposition good my lord
[SHK] I would not hear your enemy say so
[SHK] Nor shall you do mine ear that violence
[SHK] To make it truster of your own report
[SHK] Against yourself I know you are no truant
[SHK] But what is your affair in Elsinore
[SHK] We 'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
[SHK] My lord I came to see your father 's funeral
[SHK] I pray thee do not mock me fellow-student
[SHK] I think it was to see my mother 's wedding
[SHK] Indeed my lord it follow 'd hard upon
[SHK] Thrift thrift Horatio the funeral baked meats
[SHK] Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
[SHK] Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
[SHK] Or ever I had seen that day Horatio
[SHK] My father -- methinks I see my father
[SHK] Where my lord
[SHK] In my mind 's eye Horatio
[SHK] I saw him once he was a goodly king
[SHK] He was a man take him for all in all
[SHK] I shall not look upon his like again
[SHK] My lord I think I saw him yesternight
[SHK] Saw who
[SHK] My lord the king your father
[SHK] The king my father
[SHK] Season your admiration for awhile
[SHK] With an attent ear till I may deliver
[SHK] Upon the witness of these gentlemen
[SHK] This marvel to you
[SHK] For God 's love let me hear
[SHK] Two nights together had these gentlemen
[SHK] Marcellus and Bernardo on their watch
[SHK] In the dead vast and middle of the night
[SHK] Been thus encounter 'd A figure like your father
[SHK] Armed at point exactly cap-a-pe
[SHK] Appears before them and with solemn march
[SHK] Goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk 'd
[SHK] By their oppress 'd and fear-surprised eyes
[SHK] Within his truncheon 's length whilst they distilled
[SHK] Almost to jelly with the act of fear
[SHK] Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
[SHK] In dreadful secrecy impart they did
[SHK] And I with them the third night kept the watch
[SHK] Where as they had deliver 'd both in time
[SHK] Form of the thing each word made true and good
[SHK] The apparition comes I knew your father
[SHK] These hands are not more like
[SHK] But where was this
[SHK] My lord upon the platform where we watch 'd
[SHK] Did you not speak to it
[SHK] My lord I did
[SHK] But answer made it none yet once methought
[SHK] It lifted up its head and did address
[SHK] Itself to motion like as it would speak
[SHK] But even then the morning cock crew loud
[SHK] And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
[SHK] And vanish 'd from our sight
[SHK] 'T is very strange
[SHK] As I do live my honour 'd lord 't is true
[SHK] And we did think it writ down in our duty
[SHK] To let you know of it
[SHK] Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
[SHK] Hold you the watch to-night
[SHK] We do my lord
[SHK] Arm 'd say you
[SHK] Arm 'd my lord
[SHK] From top to toe
[SHK] My lord from head to foot
[SHK] Then saw you not his face
[SHK] O yes my lord he wore his beaver up
[SHK] What look 'd he frowningly
[SHK] A countenance more in sorrow than in anger
[SHK] Pale or red
[SHK] Nay very pale
[SHK] And fix 'd his eyes upon you
[SHK] Most constantly
[SHK] I would I had been there
[SHK] It would have much amazed you
[SHK] Very like very like Stay 'd it long
[SHK] While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
[SHK] Longer longer
[SHK] Not when I saw't
[SHK] His beard was grizzled -- no
[SHK] It was as I have seen it in his life
[SHK] A sable silver 'd
[SHK] I will watch to-night
[SHK] Perchance 'twill walk again
[SHK] I warrant it will
[SHK] If it assume my noble father 's person
[SHK] I 'll speak to it though hell itself should gape
[SHK] And bid me hold my peace I pray you all
[SHK] If you have hitherto conceal 'd this sight
[SHK] Let it be tenable in your silence still
[SHK] And whatsoever else shall hap to-night
[SHK] Give it an understanding but no tongue
[SHK] I will requite your loves So fare you well
[SHK] Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve
[SHK] I 'll visit you
[SHK] Our duty to your honour
[SHK] Your loves as mine to you farewell
[SHK] My father 's spirit in arms all is not well
[SHK] I doubt some foul play would the night were come
[SHK] Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
[SHK] Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men 's eyes
[SHK] My necessaries are embark 'd farewell
[SHK] And sister as the winds give benefit
[SHK] And convoy is assistant do not sleep
[SHK] But let me hear from you
[SHK] Do you doubt that
[SHK] For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour
[SHK] Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
[SHK] A violet in the youth of primy nature
[SHK] Forward not permanent sweet not lasting
[SHK] The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more
[SHK] No more but so
[SHK] Think it no more
[SHK] For nature crescent does not grow alone
[SHK] In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
[SHK] The inward service of the mind and soul
[SHK] Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now
[SHK] And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
[SHK] The virtue of his will but you must fear
[SHK] His greatness weigh 'd his will is not his own
[SHK] For he himself is subject to his birth
[SHK] He may not as unvalued persons do
[SHK] Carve for himself for on his choice depends
[SHK] The safety and health of this whole state
[SHK] And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
[SHK] Unto the voice and yielding of that body
[SHK] Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you
[SHK] It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
[SHK] As he in his particular act and place
[SHK] May give his saying deed which is no further
[SHK] Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
[SHK] Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
[SHK] If with too credent ear you list his songs
[SHK] Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
[SHK] To his unmaster 'd importunity
[SHK] Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister
[SHK] And keep you in the rear of your affection
[SHK] Out of the shot and danger of desire
[SHK] The chariest maid is prodigal enough
[SHK] If she unmask her beauty to the moon
[SHK] Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes
[SHK] The canker galls the infants of the spring
[SHK] Too oft before their buttons be disclosed
[SHK] And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
[SHK] Contagious blastments are most imminent
[SHK] Be wary then best safety lies in fear
[SHK] Youth to itself rebels though none else near
[SHK] I shall the effect of this good lesson keep
[SHK] As watchman to my heart But good my brother
[SHK] Do not as some ungracious pastors do
[SHK] Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
[SHK] Whiles like a puff 'd and reckless libertine
[SHK] Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
[SHK] And recks not his own rede
[SHK] O fear me not
[SHK] I stay too long but here my father comes
[SHK] A double blessing is a double grace
[SHK] Occasion smiles upon a second leave
[SHK] Yet here Laertes aboard aboard for shame
[SHK] The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
[SHK] And you are stay 'd for There my blessing with thee
[SHK] And these few precepts in thy memory
[SHK] See thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue
[SHK] Nor any unproportioned thought his act
[SHK] Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
[SHK] Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
[SHK] Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
[SHK] But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
[SHK] Of each new-hatch 'd unfledged comrade Beware
[SHK] Of entrance to a quarrel but being in
[SHK] Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee
[SHK] Give every man thy ear but few thy voice
[SHK] Take each man 's censure but reserve thy judgment
[SHK] Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
[SHK] But not express 'd in fancy rich not gaudy
[SHK] For the apparel oft proclaims the man
[SHK] And they in France of the best rank and station
[SHK] Are of a most select and generous chief in that
[SHK] Neither a borrower nor a lender be
[SHK] For loan oft loses both itself and friend
[SHK] And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
[SHK] This above all to thine ownself be true
[SHK] And it must follow as the night the day
[SHK] Thou canst not then be false to any man
[SHK] Farewell my blessing season this in thee
[SHK] Most humbly do I take my leave my lord
[SHK] The time invites you go your servants tend
[SHK] Farewell Ophelia and remember well
[SHK] What I have said to you
[SHK] 'T is in my memory lock 'd
[SHK] And you yourself shall keep the key of it
[SHK] Farewell
[SHK] What is't Ophelia be hath said to you
[SHK] So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
[SHK] Marry well bethought
[SHK] 'T is told me he hath very oft of late
[SHK] Given private time to you and you yourself
[SHK] Have of your audience been most free and bounteous
[SHK] If it be so as so 't is put on me
[SHK] And that in way of caution I must tell you
[SHK] You do not understand yourself so clearly
[SHK] As it behoves my daughter and your honour
[SHK] What is between you give me up the truth
[SHK] He hath my lord of late made many tenders
[SHK] Of his affection to me
[SHK] Affection pooh you speak like a green girl
[SHK] Unsifted in such perilous circumstance
[SHK] Do you believe his tenders as you call them
[SHK] I do not know my lord what I should think
[SHK] Marry I 'll teach you think yourself a baby
[SHK] That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
[SHK] Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly
[SHK] Or -- not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
[SHK] Running it thus -- you 'll tender me a fool
[SHK] My lord he hath importuned me with love
[SHK] In honourable fashion
[SHK] Ay fashion you may call it go to go to
[SHK] And hath given countenance to his speech my lord
[SHK] With almost all the holy vows of heaven
[SHK] Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know
[SHK] When the blood burns how prodigal the soul
[SHK] Lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
[SHK] Giving more light than heat extinct in both
[SHK] Even in their promise as it is a-making
[SHK] You must not take for fire From this time
[SHK] Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence
[SHK] Set your entreatments at a higher rate
[SHK] Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet
[SHK] Believe so much in him that he is young
[SHK] And with a larger tether may he walk
[SHK] Than may be given you in few Ophelia
[SHK] Do not believe his vows for they are brokers
[SHK] Not of that dye which their investments show
[SHK] But mere implorators of unholy suits
[SHK] Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
[SHK] The better to beguile This is for all
[SHK] I would not in plain terms from this time forth
[SHK] Have you so slander any moment leisure
[SHK] As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
[SHK] Look to't I charge you come your ways
[SHK] I shall obey my lord
[SHK] The air bites shrewdly it is very cold
[SHK] It is a nipping and an eager air
[SHK] What hour now
[SHK] I think it lacks of twelve
[SHK] No it is struck
[SHK] Indeed I heard it not then it draws near the season
[SHK] Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
[SHK] What does this mean my lord
[SHK] The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse
[SHK] Keeps wassail and the swaggering up-spring reels
[SHK] And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
[SHK] The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
[SHK] The triumph of his pledge
[SHK] Is it a custom
[SHK] Ay marry is't
[SHK] But to my mind though I am native here
[SHK] And to the manner born it is a custom
[SHK] More honour 'd in the breach than the observance
[SHK] This heavy-headed revel east and west
[SHK] Makes us traduced and tax 'd of other nations
[SHK] They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
[SHK] Soil our addition and indeed it takes
[SHK] From our achievements though perform 'd at height
[SHK] The pith and marrow of our attribute
[SHK] So oft it chances in particular men
[SHK] That for some vicious mole of nature in them
[SHK] As in their birth -- wherein they are not guilty
[SHK] Since nature can not choose his origin --
[SHK] By the o'ergrowth of some complexion
[SHK] Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
[SHK] Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
[SHK] The form of plausive manners that these men
[SHK] Carrying I say the stamp of one defect
[SHK] Being nature 's livery or fortune 's star --
[SHK] Their virtues else -- be they as pure as grace
[SHK] As infinite as man may undergo --
[SHK] Shall in the general censure take corruption
[SHK] From that particular fault the dram of eale
[SHK] Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
[SHK] To his own scandal
[SHK] Look my lord it comes
[SHK] Angels and ministers of grace defend us
[SHK] Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn 'd
[SHK] Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
[SHK] Be thy intents wicked or charitable
[SHK] Thou comest in such a questionable shape
[SHK] That I will speak to thee I 'll call thee Hamlet
[SHK] King father royal Dane O answer me
[SHK] Let me not burst in ignorance but tell
[SHK] Why thy canonized bones hearsed in death
[SHK] Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
[SHK] Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn 'd
[SHK] Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
[SHK] To cast thee up again What may this mean
[SHK] That thou dead corse again in complete steel
[SHK] Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon
[SHK] Making night hideous and we fools of nature
[SHK] So horridly to shake our disposition
[SHK] With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
[SHK] Say why is this wherefore what should we do
[SHK] It beckons you to go away with it
[SHK] As if it some impartment did desire
[SHK] To you alone
[SHK] Look with what courteous action
[SHK] It waves you to a more removed ground
[SHK] But do not go with it
[SHK] No by no means
[SHK] It will not speak then I will follow it
[SHK] Do not my lord
[SHK] Why what should be the fear
[SHK] I do not set my life in a pin 's fee
[SHK] And for my soul what can it do to that
[SHK] Being a thing immortal as itself
[SHK] It waves me forth again I 'll follow it
[SHK] What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
[SHK] Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
[SHK] That beetles o'er his base into the sea
[SHK] And there assume some other horrible form
[SHK] Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
[SHK] And draw you into madness think of it
[SHK] The very place puts toys of desperation
[SHK] Without more motive into every brain
[SHK] That looks so many fathoms to the sea
[SHK] And hears it roar beneath
[SHK] It waves me still
[SHK] Go on I 'll follow thee
[SHK] You shall not go my lord
[SHK] Hold off your hands
[SHK] Be ruled you shall not go
[SHK] My fate cries out
[SHK] And makes each petty artery in this body
[SHK] As hardy as the Nemean lion 's nerve
[SHK] Still am I call 'd Unhand me gentlemen
[SHK] By heaven I 'll make a ghost of him that lets me
[SHK] I say away Go on I 'll follow thee
[SHK] He waxes desperate with imagination
[SHK] Let 's follow 't is not fit thus to obey him
[SHK] Have after To what issue will this come
[SHK] Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
[SHK] Heaven will direct it
[SHK] Nay let 's follow him
[SHK] Where wilt thou lead me speak I 'll go no further
[SHK] Mark me
[SHK] I will
[SHK] My hour is almost come
[SHK] When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
[SHK] Must render up myself
[SHK] Alas poor ghost
[SHK] Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
[SHK] To what I shall unfold
[SHK] Speak I am bound to hear
[SHK] So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
[SHK] What
[SHK] I am thy father 's spirit
[SHK] Doom 'd for a certain term to walk the night
[SHK] And for the day confined to fast in fires
[SHK] Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
[SHK] Are burnt and purged away But that I am forbid
[SHK] To tell the secrets of my prison-house
[SHK] I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
[SHK] Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
[SHK] Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
[SHK] Thy knotted and combined locks to part
[SHK] And each particular hair to stand on end
[SHK] Like quills upon the fretful porpentine
[SHK] But this eternal blazon must not be
[SHK] To ears of flesh and blood List list O list
[SHK] If thou didst ever thy dear father love --
[SHK] O God
[SHK] Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
[SHK] Murder
[SHK] Murder most foul as in the best it is
[SHK] But this most foul strange and unnatural
[SHK] Haste me to know't that I with wings as swift
[SHK] As meditation or the thoughts of love
[SHK] May sweep to my revenge
[SHK] I find thee apt
[SHK] And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
[SHK] That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
[SHK] Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear
[SHK] 'T is given out that sleeping in my orchard
[SHK] A serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmark
[SHK] Is by a forged process of my death
[SHK] Rankly abused but know thou noble youth
[SHK] The serpent that did sting thy father 's life
[SHK] Now wears his crown
[SHK] O my prophetic soul My uncle
[SHK] Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
[SHK] With witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts --
[SHK] O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
[SHK] So to seduce -- won to his shameful lust
[SHK] The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen
[SHK] O Hamlet what a falling-off was there
[SHK] From me whose love was of that dignity
[SHK] That it went hand in hand even with the vow
[SHK] I made to her in marriage and to decline
[SHK] Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
[SHK] To those of mine
[SHK] But virtue as it never will be moved
[SHK] Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
[SHK] So lust though to a radiant angel link 'd
[SHK] Will sate itself in a celestial bed
[SHK] And prey on garbage
[SHK] But soft methinks I scent the morning air
[SHK] Brief let me be Sleeping within my orchard
[SHK] My custom always of the afternoon
[SHK] Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
[SHK] With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
[SHK] And in the porches of my ears did pour
[SHK] The leperous distilment whose effect
[SHK] Holds such an enmity with blood of man
[SHK] That swift as quicksilver it courses through
[SHK] The natural gates and alleys of the body
[SHK] And with a sudden vigour doth posset
[SHK] And curd like eager droppings into milk
[SHK] The thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
[SHK] And a most instant tetter bark 'd about
[SHK] Most lazar-like with vile and loathsome crust
[SHK] All my smooth body
[SHK] Thus was I sleeping by a brother 's hand
[SHK] Of life of crown of queen at once dispatch 'd
[SHK] Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
[SHK] Unhousel 'd disappointed unanel 'd
[SHK] No reckoning made but sent to my account
[SHK] With all my imperfections on my head
[SHK] O horrible O horrible most horrible
[SHK] If thou hast nature in thee bear it not
[SHK] Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
[SHK] A couch for luxury and damned incest
[SHK] But howsoever thou pursuest this act
[SHK] Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
[SHK] Against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
[SHK] And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
[SHK] To prick and sting her Fare thee well at once
[SHK] The glow-worm shows the matin to be near
[SHK] And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire
[SHK] Adieu adieu Hamlet remember me
[SHK] O all you host of heaven O earth what else
[SHK] And shall I couple hell O fie Hold hold my heart
[SHK] And you my sinews grow not instant old
[SHK] But bear me stiffly up Remember thee
[SHK] Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
[SHK] In this distracted globe Remember thee
[SHK] Yea from the table of my memory
[SHK] I 'll wipe away all trivial fond records
[SHK] All saws of books all forms all pressures past
[SHK] That youth and observation copied there
[SHK] And thy commandment all alone shall live
[SHK] Within the book and volume of my brain
[SHK] Unmix 'd with baser matter yes by heaven
[SHK] O most pernicious woman
[SHK] O villain villain smiling damned villain
[SHK] My tables -- meet it is I set it down
[SHK] That one may smile and smile and be a villain
[SHK] At least I 'm sure it may be so in Denmark
[SHK] So uncle there you are Now to my word
[SHK] It is 'Adieu adieu remember me
[SHK] I have sworn 't
[SHK] So be it
[SHK] Hillo ho ho boy come bird come
[SHK] How is't my noble lord
[SHK] What news my lord
[SHK] O wonderful
[SHK] Good my lord tell it
[SHK] No you 'll reveal it
[SHK] Not I my lord by heaven
[SHK] Nor I my lord
[SHK] How say you then would heart of man once think it
[SHK] But you 'll be secret
[SHK] Ay by heaven my lord
[SHK] There 's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
[SHK] But he 's an arrant knave
[SHK] There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
[SHK] To tell us this
[SHK] Why right you are i the right
[SHK] And so without more circumstance at all
[SHK] I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
[SHK] You as your business and desire shall point you
[SHK] For every man has business and desire
[SHK] Such as it is and for mine own poor part
[SHK] Look you I 'll go pray
[SHK] These are but wild and whirling words my lord
[SHK] I 'm sorry they offend you heartily
[SHK] Yes 'faith heartily
[SHK] There 's no offence my lord
[SHK] Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio
[SHK] And much offence too Touching this vision here
[SHK] It is an honest ghost that let me tell you
[SHK] For your desire to know what is between us
[SHK] O'ermaster 't as you may And now good friends
[SHK] As you are friends scholars and soldiers
[SHK] Give me one poor request
[SHK] What is't my lord we will
[SHK] Never make known what you have seen to-night
[SHK] My lord we will not
[SHK] Nay but swear't
[SHK] In faith
[SHK] My lord not I
[SHK] Nor I my lord in faith
[SHK] Upon my sword
[SHK] We have sworn my lord already
[SHK] Indeed upon my sword indeed
[SHK] Ah ha boy say'st thou so art thou there
[SHK] truepenny
[SHK] Come on -- you hear this fellow in the cellarage --
[SHK] Consent to swear
[SHK] Propose the oath my lord
[SHK] Never to speak of this that you have seen
[SHK] Swear by my sword
[SHK] Hic et ubique then we 'll shift our ground
[SHK] Come hither gentlemen
[SHK] And lay your hands again upon my sword
[SHK] Never to speak of this that you have heard
[SHK] Swear by my sword
[SHK] Well said old mole canst work i the earth so fast
[SHK] A worthy pioner Once more remove good friends
[SHK] O day and night but this is wondrous strange
[SHK] And therefore as a stranger give it welcome
[SHK] There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio
[SHK] Than are dreamt of in your philosophy But come
[SHK] Here as before never so help you mercy
[SHK] How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
[SHK] As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
[SHK] To put an antic disposition on
[SHK] That you at such times seeing me never shall
[SHK] With arms encumber 'd thus or this headshake
[SHK] Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
[SHK] As 'Well well we know or 'We could an if we would
[SHK] Or 'If we list to speak or 'There be an if they might
[SHK] Or such ambiguous giving out to note
[SHK] That you know aught of me this not to do
[SHK] So grace and mercy at your most need help you Swear
[SHK] Rest rest perturbed spirit
[SHK] So gentlemen
[SHK] With all my love I do commend me to you
[SHK] And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
[SHK] May do to express his love and friending to you
[SHK] God willing shall not lack Let us go in together
[SHK] And still your fingers on your lips I pray
[SHK] The time is out of joint O cursed spite
[SHK] That ever I was born to set it right
[SHK] Nay come let 's go together
[SHK] Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
[SHK] I will my lord
[SHK] You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo
[SHK] Before you visit him to make inquire
[SHK] Of his behavior
[SHK] My lord I did intend it
[SHK] Marry well said very well said Look you sir
[SHK] Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris
[SHK] And how and who what means and where they keep
[SHK] What company at what expense and finding
[SHK] By this encompassment and drift of question
[SHK] That they do know my son come you more nearer
[SHK] Than your particular demands will touch it
[SHK] Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him
[SHK] As thus I know his father and his friends
[SHK] And in part him do you mark this Reynaldo
[SHK] Ay very well my lord
[SHK] 'And in part him but you may say 'not well
[SHK] But if't be he I mean he 's very wild
[SHK] Addicted so and so and there put on him
[SHK] What forgeries you please marry none so rank
[SHK] As may dishonour him take heed of that
[SHK] But sir such wanton wild and usual slips
[SHK] As are companions noted and most known
[SHK] To youth and liberty
[SHK] As gaming my lord
[SHK] Ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
[SHK] Drabbing you may go so far
[SHK] My lord that would dishonour him
[SHK] 'Faith no as you may season it in the charge
[SHK] You must not put another scandal on him
[SHK] That he is open to incontinency
[SHK] That 's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
[SHK] That they may seem the taints of liberty
[SHK] The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
[SHK] A savageness in unreclaimed blood
[SHK] Of general assault
[SHK] But my good lord --
[SHK] Wherefore should you do this
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] I would know that
[SHK] Marry sir here 's my drift
[SHK] And I believe it is a fetch of wit
[SHK] You laying these slight sullies on my son
[SHK] As 'twere a thing a little soil 'd i the working Mark you
[SHK] Your party in converse him you would sound
[SHK] Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
[SHK] The youth you breathe of guilty be assured
[SHK] He closes with you in this consequence
[SHK] 'Good sir or so or 'friend or 'gentleman
[SHK] According to the phrase or the addition
[SHK] Of man and country
[SHK] Very good my lord
[SHK] And then sir does he this -- he does -- what was I
[SHK] about to say By the mass I was about to say
[SHK] something where did I leave
[SHK] At 'closes in the consequence at 'friend or so
[SHK] and 'gentleman
[SHK] At 'closes in the consequence ay marry
[SHK] He closes thus I know the gentleman
[SHK] I saw him yesterday or t other day
[SHK] Or then or then with such or such and as you say
[SHK] There was a gaming there o'ertook in 's rouse
[SHK] There falling out at tennis or perchance
[SHK] I saw him enter such a house of sale
[SHK] Videlicet a brothel or so forth
[SHK] See you now
[SHK] Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
[SHK] And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
[SHK] With windlasses and with assays of bias
[SHK] By indirections find directions out
[SHK] So by my former lecture and advice
[SHK] Shall you my son You have me have you not
[SHK] My lord I have
[SHK] God be wi you fare you well
[SHK] Good my lord
[SHK] Observe his inclination in yourself
[SHK] I shall my lord
[SHK] And let him ply his music
[SHK] Well my lord
[SHK] Farewell
[SHK] How now Ophelia what 's the matter
[SHK] O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted
[SHK] With what i the name of God
[SHK] My lord as I was sewing in my closet
[SHK] Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
[SHK] No hat upon his head his stockings foul 'd
[SHK] Ungarter 'd and down-gyved to his ancle
[SHK] Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
[SHK] And with a look so piteous in purport
[SHK] As if he had been loosed out of hell
[SHK] To speak of horrors -- he comes before me
[SHK] Mad for thy love
[SHK] My lord I do not know
[SHK] But truly I do fear it
[SHK] What said he
[SHK] He took me by the wrist and held me hard
[SHK] Then goes he to the length of all his arm
[SHK] And with his other hand thus o'er his brow
[SHK] He falls to such perusal of my face
[SHK] As he would draw it Long stay 'd he so
[SHK] At last a little shaking of mine arm
[SHK] And thrice his head thus waving up and down
[SHK] He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
[SHK] As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
[SHK] And end his being that done he lets me go
[SHK] And with his head over his shoulder turn 'd
[SHK] He seem 'd to find his way without his eyes
[SHK] For out o doors he went without their helps
[SHK] And to the last bended their light on me
[SHK] Come go with me I will go seek the king
[SHK] This is the very ecstasy of love
[SHK] Whose violent property fordoes itself
[SHK] And leads the will to desperate undertakings
[SHK] As oft as any passion under heaven
[SHK] That does afflict our natures I am sorry
[SHK] What have you given him any hard words of late
[SHK] No my good lord but as you did command
[SHK] I did repel his fetters and denied
[SHK] His access to me
[SHK] That hath made him mad
[SHK] I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
[SHK] I had not quoted him I fear 'd he did but trifle
[SHK] And meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
[SHK] By heaven it is as proper to our age
[SHK] To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
[SHK] As it is common for the younger sort
[SHK] To lack discretion Come go we to the king
[SHK] This must be known which being kept close might
[SHK] move
[SHK] More grief to hide than hate to utter love
[SHK] Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
[SHK] Moreover that we much did long to see you
[SHK] The need we have to use you did provoke
[SHK] Our hasty sending Something have you heard
[SHK] Of Hamlet 's transformation so call it
[SHK] Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
[SHK] Resembles that it was What it should be
[SHK] More than his father 's death that thus hath put him
[SHK] So much from the understanding of himself
[SHK] I can not dream of I entreat you both
[SHK] That being of so young days brought up with him
[SHK] And sith so neighbour 'd to his youth and havior
[SHK] That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
[SHK] Some little time so by your companies
[SHK] To draw him on to pleasures and to gather
[SHK] So much as from occasion you may glean
[SHK] Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
[SHK] That open 'd lies within our remedy
[SHK] Good gentlemen he hath much talk 'd of you
[SHK] And sure I am two men there are not living
[SHK] To whom he more adheres If it will please you
[SHK] To show us so much gentry and good will
[SHK] As to expend your time with us awhile
[SHK] For the supply and profit of our hope
[SHK] Your visitation shall receive such thanks
[SHK] As fits a king 's remembrance
[SHK] Both your majesties
[SHK] Might by the sovereign power you have of us
[SHK] Put your dread pleasures more into command
[SHK] Than to entreaty
[SHK] But we both obey
[SHK] And here give up ourselves in the full bent
[SHK] To lay our service freely at your feet
[SHK] To be commanded
[SHK] Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
[SHK] Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
[SHK] And I beseech you instantly to visit
[SHK] My too much changed son Go some of you
[SHK] And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
[SHK] Heavens make our presence and our practises
[SHK] Pleasant and helpful to him
[SHK] Ay amen
[SHK] The ambassadors from Norway my good lord
[SHK] Are joyfully return 'd
[SHK] Thou still hast been the father of good news
[SHK] Have I my lord I assure my good liege
[SHK] I hold my duty as I hold my soul
[SHK] Both to my God and to my gracious king
[SHK] And I do think or else this brain of mine
[SHK] Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
[SHK] As it hath used to do that I have found
[SHK] The very cause of Hamlet 's lunacy
[SHK] O speak of that that do I long to hear
[SHK] Give first admittance to the ambassadors
[SHK] My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
[SHK] Thyself do grace to them and bring them in
[SHK] He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found
[SHK] The head and source of all your son 's distemper
[SHK] I doubt it is no other but the main
[SHK] His father 's death and our o'erhasty marriage
[SHK] Well we shall sift him
[SHK] Welcome my good friends
[SHK] Say Voltimand what from our brother Norway
[SHK] Most fair return of greetings and desires
[SHK] Upon our first he sent out to suppress
[SHK] His nephew 's levies which to him appear 'd
[SHK] To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack
[SHK] But better look 'd into he truly found
[SHK] It was against your highness whereat grieved
[SHK] That so his sickness age and impotence
[SHK] Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
[SHK] On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys
[SHK] Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine
[SHK] Makes vow before his uncle never more
[SHK] To give the assay of arms against your majesty
[SHK] Whereon old Norway overcome with joy
[SHK] Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
[SHK] And his commission to employ those soldiers
[SHK] So levied as before against the Polack
[SHK] With an entreaty herein further shown
[SHK] That it might please you to give quiet pass
[SHK] Through your dominions for this enterprise
[SHK] On such regards of safety and allowance
[SHK] As therein are set down
[SHK] It likes us well
[SHK] And at our more consider 'd time well read
[SHK] Answer and think upon this business
[SHK] Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour
[SHK] Go to your rest at night we 'll feast together
[SHK] Most welcome home
[SHK] This business is well ended
[SHK] My liege and madam to expostulate
[SHK] What majesty should be what duty is
[SHK] Why day is day night night and time is time
[SHK] Were nothing but to waste night day and time
[SHK] Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
[SHK] And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
[SHK] I will be brief your noble son is mad
[SHK] Mad call I it for to define true madness
[SHK] What is't but to be nothing else but mad
[SHK] But let that go
[SHK] More matter with less art
[SHK] Madam I swear I use no art at all
[SHK] That he is mad 't is true 't is true 't is pity
[SHK] And pity 't is 't is true a foolish figure
[SHK] But farewell it for I will use no art
[SHK] Mad let us grant him then and now remains
[SHK] That we find out the cause of this effect
[SHK] Or rather say the cause of this defect
[SHK] For this effect defective comes by cause
[SHK] Thus it remains and the remainder thus Perpend
[SHK] I have a daughter -- have while she is mine --
[SHK] Who in her duty and obedience mark
[SHK] Hath given me this now gather and surmise
[SHK] 'To the celestial and my soul 's idol the most
[SHK] beautified Ophelia --
[SHK] That 's an ill phrase a vile phrase 'beautified is
[SHK] a vile phrase but you shall hear Thus
[SHK] 'In her excellent white bosom these c
[SHK] Came this from Hamlet to her
[SHK] Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful
[SHK] 'Doubt thou the stars are fire
[SHK] Doubt that the sun doth move
[SHK] Doubt truth to be a liar
[SHK] But never doubt I love
[SHK] O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers
[SHK] I have not art to reckon my groans but that
[SHK] I love thee best O most best believe it Adieu
[SHK] 'Thine evermore most dear lady whilst
[SHK] this machine is to him HAMLET
[SHK] This in obedience hath my daughter shown me
[SHK] And more above hath his solicitings
[SHK] As they fell out by time by means and place
[SHK] All given to mine ear
[SHK] But how hath she
[SHK] Received his love
[SHK] What do you think of me
[SHK] As of a man faithful and honourable
[SHK] I would fain prove so But what might you think
[SHK] When I had seen this hot love on the wing --
[SHK] As I perceived it I must tell you that
[SHK] Before my daughter told me -- what might you
[SHK] Or my dear majesty your queen here think
[SHK] If I had play 'd the desk or table-book
[SHK] Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
[SHK] Or look 'd upon this love with idle sight
[SHK] What might you think No I went round to work
[SHK] And my young mistress thus I did bespeak
[SHK] 'Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star
[SHK] This must not be and then I precepts gave her
[SHK] That she should lock herself from his resort
[SHK] Admit no messengers receive no tokens
[SHK] Which done she took the fruits of my advice
[SHK] And he repulsed -- a short tale to make --
[SHK] Fell into a sadness then into a fast
[SHK] Thence to a watch thence into a weakness
[SHK] Thence to a lightness and by this declension
[SHK] Into the madness wherein now he raves
[SHK] And all we mourn for
[SHK] Do you think 't is this
[SHK] It may be very likely
[SHK] Hath there been such a time -- I 'd fain know that --
[SHK] That I have positively said 'T is so
[SHK] When it proved otherwise
[SHK] Not that I know
[SHK] Take this from this if this be otherwise
[SHK] If circumstances lead me I will find
[SHK] Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
[SHK] Within the centre
[SHK] How may we try it further
[SHK] You know sometimes he walks four hours together
[SHK] Here in the lobby
[SHK] So he does indeed
[SHK] At such a time I 'll loose my daughter to him
[SHK] Be you and I behind an arras then
[SHK] Mark the encounter if he love her not
[SHK] And be not from his reason fall'n thereon
[SHK] Let me be no assistant for a state
[SHK] But keep a farm and carters
[SHK] We will try it
[SHK] But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
[SHK] Away I do beseech you both away
[SHK] I 'll board him presently
[SHK] O give me leave
[SHK] How does my good Lord Hamlet
[SHK] Well God-a-mercy
[SHK] Do you know me my lord
[SHK] Excellent well you are a fishmonger
[SHK] Not I my lord
[SHK] Then I would you were so honest a man
[SHK] Honest my lord
[SHK] Ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be
[SHK] one man picked out of ten thousand
[SHK] That 's very true my lord
[SHK] For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a
[SHK] god kissing carrion -- Have you a daughter
[SHK] I have my lord
[SHK] Let her not walk i the sun conception is a
[SHK] blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
[SHK] Friend look to 't
[SHK] daughter yet he knew me not at first he said I
[SHK] was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and
[SHK] truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
[SHK] love very near this I 'll speak to him again
[SHK] What do you read my lord
[SHK] Words words words
[SHK] What is the matter my lord
[SHK] Between who
[SHK] I mean the matter that you read my lord
[SHK] Slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here
[SHK] that old men have grey beards that their faces are
[SHK] wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and
[SHK] plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
[SHK] wit together with most weak hams all which sir
[SHK] though I most powerfully and potently believe yet
[SHK] I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for
[SHK] yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab
[SHK] you could go backward
[SHK] in 't Will you walk out of the air my lord
[SHK] Into my grave
[SHK] Indeed that is out o the air
[SHK] How pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness
[SHK] that often madness hits on which reason and sanity
[SHK] could not so prosperously be delivered of I will
[SHK] leave him and suddenly contrive the means of
[SHK] meeting between him and my daughter. -- My honourable
[SHK] lord I will most humbly take my leave of you
[SHK] You can not sir take from me any thing that I will
[SHK] more willingly part withal except my life except
[SHK] my life except my life
[SHK] Fare you well my lord
[SHK] These tedious old fools
[SHK] You go to seek the Lord Hamlet there he is
[SHK] My honoured lord
[SHK] My most dear lord
[SHK] My excellent good friends How dost thou
[SHK] Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both
[SHK] As the indifferent children of the earth
[SHK] Happy in that we are not over-happy
[SHK] On fortune 's cap we are not the very button
[SHK] Nor the soles of her shoe
[SHK] Neither my lord
[SHK] Then you live about her waist or in the middle of
[SHK] her favours
[SHK] 'Faith her privates we
[SHK] In the secret parts of fortune O most true she
[SHK] is a strumpet What 's the news
[SHK] None my lord but that the world 's grown honest
[SHK] Then is doomsday near but your news is not true
[SHK] Let me question more in particular what have you
[SHK] my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune
[SHK] that she sends you to prison hither
[SHK] Prison my lord
[SHK] Denmark 's a prison
[SHK] Then is the world one
[SHK] A goodly one in which there are many confines
[SHK] wards and dungeons Denmark being one o the worst
[SHK] We think not so my lord
[SHK] Why then 't is none to you for there is nothing
[SHK] either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me
[SHK] it is a prison
[SHK] Why then your ambition makes it one 't is too
[SHK] narrow for your mind
[SHK] O God I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
[SHK] myself a king of infinite space were it not that I
[SHK] have bad dreams
[SHK] Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very
[SHK] substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
[SHK] A dream itself is but a shadow
[SHK] Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
[SHK] quality that it is but a shadow 's shadow
[SHK] Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and
[SHK] outstretched heroes the beggars shadows Shall we
[SHK] to the court for by my fay I can not reason
[SHK] We 'll wait upon you
[SHK] No such matter I will not sort you with the rest
[SHK] of my servants for to speak to you like an honest
[SHK] man I am most dreadfully attended But in the
[SHK] beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore
[SHK] To visit you my lord no other occasion
[SHK] Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I
[SHK] thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are
[SHK] too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for Is it
[SHK] your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come
[SHK] deal justly with me come come nay speak
[SHK] What should we say my lord
[SHK] Why any thing but to the purpose You were sent
[SHK] for and there is a kind of confession in your looks
[SHK] which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
[SHK] I know the good king and queen have sent for you
[SHK] To what end my lord
[SHK] That you must teach me But let me conjure you by
[SHK] the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of
[SHK] our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved
[SHK] love and by what more dear a better proposer could
[SHK] charge you withal be even and direct with me
[SHK] whether you were sent for or no
[SHK] love me hold not off
[SHK] My lord we were sent for
[SHK] I will tell you why so shall my anticipation
[SHK] prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king
[SHK] and queen moult no feather I have of late -- but
[SHK] wherefore I know not -- lost all my mirth forgone all
[SHK] custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily
[SHK] with my disposition that this goodly frame the
[SHK] earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most
[SHK] excellent canopy the air look you this brave
[SHK] o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted
[SHK] with golden fire why it appears no other thing to
[SHK] me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
[SHK] What a piece of work is a man how noble in reason
[SHK] how infinite in faculty in form and moving how
[SHK] express and admirable in action how like an angel
[SHK] in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the
[SHK] world the paragon of animals And yet to me
[SHK] what is this quintessence of dust man delights not
[SHK] me no nor woman neither though by your smiling
[SHK] you seem to say so
[SHK] My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
[SHK] Why did you laugh then when I said 'man delights not me
[SHK] To think my lord if you delight not in man what
[SHK] lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
[SHK] you we coted them on the way and hither are they
[SHK] coming to offer you service
[SHK] He that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty
[SHK] shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight
[SHK] shall use his foil and target the lover shall not
[SHK] sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part
[SHK] in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
[SHK] lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall
[SHK] say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt
[SHK] for't What players are they
[SHK] Even those you were wont to take delight in the
[SHK] tragedians of the city
[SHK] How chances it they travel their residence both
[SHK] in reputation and profit was better both ways
[SHK] I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
[SHK] late innovation
[SHK] Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
[SHK] in the city are they so followed
[SHK] No indeed are they not
[SHK] How comes it do they grow rusty
[SHK] Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but
[SHK] there is sir an aery of children little eyases
[SHK] that cry out on the top of question and are most
[SHK] tyrannically clapped for't these are now the
[SHK] fashion and so berattle the common stages -- so they
[SHK] call them -- that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
[SHK] goose-quills and dare scarce come thither
[SHK] What are they children who maintains 'em how are
[SHK] they escoted Will they pursue the quality no
[SHK] longer than they can sing will they not say
[SHK] afterwards if they should grow themselves to common
[SHK] players -- as it is most like if their means are no
[SHK] better -- their writers do them wrong to make them
[SHK] exclaim against their own succession
[SHK] 'Faith there has been much to do on both sides and
[SHK] the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
[SHK] controversy there was for a while no money bid
[SHK] for argument unless the poet and the player went to
[SHK] cuffs in the question
[SHK] Is't possible
[SHK] O there has been much throwing about of brains
[SHK] Do the boys carry it away
[SHK] Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too
[SHK] It is not very strange for mine uncle is king of
[SHK] Denmark and those that would make mows at him while
[SHK] my father lived give twenty forty fifty an
[SHK] hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little
[SHK] 'Sblood there is something in this more than
[SHK] natural if philosophy could find it out
[SHK] There are the players
[SHK] Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands
[SHK] come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
[SHK] and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb
[SHK] lest my extent to the players which I tell you
[SHK] must show fairly outward should more appear like
[SHK] entertainment than yours You are welcome but my
[SHK] uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived
[SHK] In what my dear lord
[SHK] I am but mad north-north-west when the wind is
[SHK] southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw
[SHK] Well be with you gentlemen
[SHK] Hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a
[SHK] hearer that great baby you see there is not yet
[SHK] out of his swaddling-clouts
[SHK] Happily he 's the second time come to them for they
[SHK] say an old man is twice a child
[SHK] I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players
[SHK] mark it You say right sir o Monday morning
[SHK] 't was so indeed
[SHK] My lord I have news to tell you
[SHK] My lord I have news to tell you
[SHK] When Roscius was an actor in Rome --
[SHK] The actors are come hither my lord
[SHK] Buz buz
[SHK] Upon mine honour --
[SHK] Then came each actor on his ass --
[SHK] The best actors in the world either for tragedy
[SHK] comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical
[SHK] historical-pastoral tragical-historical tragical-
[SHK] comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or
[SHK] poem unlimited Seneca can not be too heavy nor
[SHK] Plautus too light For the law of writ and the
[SHK] liberty these are the only men
[SHK] O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou
[SHK] What a treasure had he my lord
[SHK] Why
[SHK] 'One fair daughter and no more
[SHK] The which he loved passing well
[SHK] Am I not i the right old Jephthah
[SHK] If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter
[SHK] that I love passing well
[SHK] Nay that follows not
[SHK] What follows then my lord
[SHK] Why
[SHK] 'As by lot God wot
[SHK] and then you know
[SHK] 'It came to pass as most like it was --
[SHK] the first row of the pious chanson will show you
[SHK] more for look where my abridgement comes
[SHK] You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad
[SHK] to see thee well Welcome good friends O my old
[SHK] friend thy face is valenced since I saw thee last
[SHK] comest thou to beard me in Denmark What my young
[SHK] lady and mistress By r lady your ladyship is
[SHK] nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
[SHK] altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like
[SHK] apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the
[SHK] ring Masters you are all welcome We 'll e'en
[SHK] to't like French falconers fly at any thing we see
[SHK] we 'll have a speech straight come give us a taste
[SHK] of your quality come a passionate speech
[SHK] What speech my lord
[SHK] I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was
[SHK] never acted or if it was not above once for the
[SHK] play I remember pleased not the million 't was
[SHK] caviare to the general but it was -- as I received
[SHK] it and others whose judgments in such matters
[SHK] cried in the top of mine -- an excellent play well
[SHK] digested in the scenes set down with as much
[SHK] modesty as cunning I remember one said there
[SHK] were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
[SHK] savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might
[SHK] indict the author of affectation but called it an
[SHK] honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very
[SHK] much more handsome than fine One speech in it I
[SHK] chiefly loved 't was Aeneas tale to Dido and
[SHK] thereabout of it especially where he speaks of
[SHK] Priam 's slaughter if it live in your memory begin
[SHK] at this line let me see let me see --
[SHK] 'The rugged Pyrrhus like the Hyrcanian beast --
[SHK] it is not so -- it begins with Pyrrhus --
[SHK] 'The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms
[SHK] Black as his purpose did the night resemble
[SHK] When he lay couched in the ominous horse
[SHK] Hath now this dread and black complexion smear 'd
[SHK] With heraldry more dismal head to foot
[SHK] Now is he total gules horridly trick 'd
[SHK] With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
[SHK] Baked and impasted with the parching streets
[SHK] That lend a tyrannous and damned light
[SHK] To their lord 's murder roasted in wrath and fire
[SHK] And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore
[SHK] With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus
[SHK] Old grandsire Priam seeks
[SHK] So proceed you
[SHK] 'Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and
[SHK] good discretion
[SHK] 'Anon he finds him
[SHK] Striking too short at Greeks his antique sword
[SHK] Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
[SHK] Repugnant to command unequal match 'd
[SHK] Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide
[SHK] But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
[SHK] The unnerved father falls Then senseless Ilium
[SHK] Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
[SHK] Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
[SHK] Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
[SHK] Which was declining on the milky head
[SHK] Of reverend Priam seem 'd i the air to stick
[SHK] So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
[SHK] And like a neutral to his will and matter
[SHK] Did nothing
[SHK] But as we often see against some storm
[SHK] A silence in the heavens the rack stand still
[SHK] The bold winds speechless and the orb below
[SHK] As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
[SHK] Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus pause
[SHK] Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work
[SHK] And never did the Cyclops hammers fall
[SHK] On Mars 's armour forged for proof eterne
[SHK] With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword
[SHK] Now falls on Priam
[SHK] Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods
[SHK] In general synod 'take away her power
[SHK] Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
[SHK] And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
[SHK] As low as to the fiends
[SHK] This is too long
[SHK] It shall to the barber 's with your beard Prithee
[SHK] say on he 's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he
[SHK] sleeps say on come to Hecuba
[SHK] 'But who O who had seen the mobled queen --
[SHK] 'The mobled queen
[SHK] That 's good 'mobled queen is good
[SHK] 'Run barefoot up and down threatening the flames
[SHK] With bisson rheum a clout upon that head
[SHK] Where late the diadem stood and for a robe
[SHK] About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins
[SHK] A blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
[SHK] Who this had seen with tongue in venom steep 'd
[SHK] 'Gainst Fortune 's state would treason have
[SHK] pronounced
[SHK] But if the gods themselves did see her then
[SHK] When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
[SHK] In mincing with his sword her husband 's limbs
[SHK] The instant burst of clamour that she made
[SHK] Unless things mortal move them not at all
[SHK] Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
[SHK] And passion in the gods
[SHK] Look whether he has not turned his colour and has
[SHK] tears in 's eyes Pray you no more
[SHK] 'T is well I 'll have thee speak out the rest soon
[SHK] Good my lord will you see the players well
[SHK] bestowed Do you hear let them be well used for
[SHK] they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
[SHK] time after your death you were better have a bad
[SHK] epitaph than their ill report while you live
[SHK] My lord I will use them according to their desert
[SHK] God 's bodykins man much better use every man
[SHK] after his desert and who should 'scape whipping
[SHK] Use them after your own honour and dignity the less
[SHK] they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
[SHK] Take them in
[SHK] Come sirs
[SHK] Follow him friends we 'll hear a play to-morrow
[SHK] Dost thou hear me old friend can you play the
[SHK] Murder of Gonzago
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] We 'll ha't to-morrow night You could for a need
[SHK] study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which
[SHK] I would set down and insert i n't could you not
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] Very well Follow that lord and look you mock him
[SHK] not
[SHK] My good friends I 'll leave you till night you are
[SHK] welcome to Elsinore
[SHK] Good my lord
[SHK] Ay so God be wi ye
[SHK] Now I am alone
[SHK] O what a rogue and peasant slave am I
[SHK] Is it not monstrous that this player here
[SHK] But in a fiction in a dream of passion
[SHK] Could force his soul so to his own conceit
[SHK] That from her working all his visage wann 'd
[SHK] Tears in his eyes distraction in 's aspect
[SHK] A broken voice and his whole function suiting
[SHK] With forms to his conceit and all for nothing
[SHK] For Hecuba
[SHK] What 's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
[SHK] That he should weep for her What would he do
[SHK] Had he the motive and the cue for passion
[SHK] That I have He would drown the stage with tears
[SHK] And cleave the general ear with horrid speech
[SHK] Make mad the guilty and appal the free
[SHK] Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
[SHK] The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I
[SHK] A dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak
[SHK] Like John-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause
[SHK] And can say nothing no not for a king
[SHK] Upon whose property and most dear life
[SHK] A damn 'd defeat was made Am I a coward
[SHK] Who calls me villain breaks my pate across
[SHK] Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
[SHK] Tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
[SHK] As deep as to the lungs who does me this
[SHK] Ha
[SHK] 'Swounds I should take it for it can not be
[SHK] But I am pigeon-liver 'd and lack gall
[SHK] To make oppression bitter or ere this
[SHK] I should have fatted all the region kites
[SHK] With this slave 's offal bloody bawdy villain
[SHK] Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
[SHK] O vengeance
[SHK] Why what an ass am I This is most brave
[SHK] That I the son of a dear father murder 'd
[SHK] Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
[SHK] Must like a whore unpack my heart with words
[SHK] And fall a-cursing like a very drab
[SHK] A scullion
[SHK] Fie upo n't foh About my brain I have heard
[SHK] That guilty creatures sitting at a play
[SHK] Have by the very cunning of the scene
[SHK] Been struck so to the soul that presently
[SHK] They have proclaim 'd their malefactions
[SHK] For murder though it have no tongue will speak
[SHK] With most miraculous organ I 'll have these players
[SHK] Play something like the murder of my father
[SHK] Before mine uncle I 'll observe his looks
[SHK] I 'll tent him to the quick if he but blench
[SHK] I know my course The spirit that I have seen
[SHK] May be the devil and the devil hath power
[SHK] To assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
[SHK] Out of my weakness and my melancholy
[SHK] As he is very potent with such spirits
[SHK] Abuses me to damn me I 'll have grounds
[SHK] More relative than this the play 's the thing
[SHK] Wherein I 'll catch the conscience of the king
[SHK] And can you by no drift of circumstance
[SHK] Get from him why he puts on this confusion
[SHK] Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
[SHK] With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
[SHK] He does confess he feels himself distracted
[SHK] But from what cause he will by no means speak
[SHK] Nor do we find him forward to be sounded
[SHK] But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
[SHK] When we would bring him on to some confession
[SHK] Of his true state
[SHK] Did he receive you well
[SHK] Most like a gentleman
[SHK] But with much forcing of his disposition
[SHK] Niggard of question but of our demands
[SHK] Most free in his reply
[SHK] Did you assay him
[SHK] To any pastime
[SHK] Madam it so fell out that certain players
[SHK] We o'er-raught on the way of these we told him
[SHK] And there did seem in him a kind of joy
[SHK] To hear of it they are about the court
[SHK] And as I think they have already order
[SHK] This night to play before him
[SHK] 'T is most true
[SHK] And he beseech 'd me to entreat your majesties
[SHK] To hear and see the matter
[SHK] With all my heart and it doth much content me
[SHK] To hear him so inclined
[SHK] Good gentlemen give him a further edge
[SHK] And drive his purpose on to these delights
[SHK] We shall my lord
[SHK] Sweet Gertrude leave us too
[SHK] For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither
[SHK] That he as 'twere by accident may here
[SHK] Affront Ophelia
[SHK] Her father and myself lawful espials
[SHK] Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
[SHK] We may of their encounter frankly judge
[SHK] And gather by him as he is behaved
[SHK] If 't be the affliction of his love or no
[SHK] That thus he suffers for
[SHK] I shall obey you
[SHK] And for your part Ophelia I do wish
[SHK] That your good beauties be the happy cause
[SHK] Of Hamlet 's wildness so shall I hope your virtues
[SHK] Will bring him to his wonted way again
[SHK] To both your honours
[SHK] Madam I wish it may
[SHK] Ophelia walk you here Gracious so please you
[SHK] We will bestow ourselves
[SHK] Read on this book
[SHK] That show of such an exercise may colour
[SHK] Your loneliness We are oft to blame in this --
[SHK] 'T is too much proved -- that with devotion 's visage
[SHK] And pious action we do sugar o'er
[SHK] The devil himself
[SHK] How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
[SHK] The harlot 's cheek beautied with plastering art
[SHK] Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
[SHK] Than is my deed to my most painted word
[SHK] O heavy burthen
[SHK] I hear him coming let 's withdraw my lord
[SHK] To be or not to be that is the question
[SHK] Whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer
[SHK] The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[SHK] Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
[SHK] And by opposing end them To die to sleep
[SHK] No more and by a sleep to say we end
[SHK] The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
[SHK] That flesh is heir to 't is a consummation
[SHK] Devoutly to be wish 'd To die to sleep
[SHK] To sleep perchance to dream ay there 's the rub
[SHK] For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
[SHK] When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
[SHK] Must give us pause there 's the respect
[SHK] That makes calamity of so long life
[SHK] For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
[SHK] The oppressor 's wrong the proud man 's contumely
[SHK] The pangs of despised love the law 's delay
[SHK] The insolence of office and the spurns
[SHK] That patient merit of the unworthy takes
[SHK] When he himself might his quietus make
[SHK] With a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
[SHK] To grunt and sweat under a weary life
[SHK] But that the dread of something after death
[SHK] The undiscover 'd country from whose bourn
[SHK] No traveller returns puzzles the will
[SHK] And makes us rather bear those ills we have
[SHK] Than fly to others that we know not of
[SHK] Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
[SHK] And thus the native hue of resolution
[SHK] Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
[SHK] And enterprises of great pith and moment
[SHK] With this regard their currents turn awry
[SHK] And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now
[SHK] The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
[SHK] Be all my sins remember 'd
[SHK] Good my lord
[SHK] How does your honour for this many a day
[SHK] I humbly thank you well well well
[SHK] My lord I have remembrances of yours
[SHK] That I have longed long to re-deliver
[SHK] I pray you now receive them
[SHK] No not I
[SHK] I never gave you aught
[SHK] My honour 'd lord you know right well you did
[SHK] And with them words of so sweet breath composed
[SHK] As made the things more rich their perfume lost
[SHK] Take these again for to the noble mind
[SHK] Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
[SHK] There my lord
[SHK] Ha ha are you honest
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] Are you fair
[SHK] What means your lordship
[SHK] That if you be honest and fair your honesty should
[SHK] admit no discourse to your beauty
[SHK] Could beauty my lord have better commerce than
[SHK] with honesty
[SHK] Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner
[SHK] transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
[SHK] force of honesty can translate beauty into his
[SHK] likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the
[SHK] time gives it proof I did love you once
[SHK] Indeed my lord you made me believe so
[SHK] You should not have believed me for virtue can not
[SHK] so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
[SHK] it I loved you not
[SHK] I was the more deceived
[SHK] Get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a
[SHK] breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest
[SHK] but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
[SHK] were better my mother had not borne me I am very
[SHK] proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at
[SHK] my beck than I have thoughts to put them in
[SHK] imagination to give them shape or time to act them
[SHK] in What should such fellows as I do crawling
[SHK] between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves
[SHK] all believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery
[SHK] Where 's your father
[SHK] At home my lord
[SHK] Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the
[SHK] fool no where but in 's own house Farewell
[SHK] O help him you sweet heavens
[SHK] If thou dost marry I 'll give thee this plague for
[SHK] thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as
[SHK] snow thou shalt not escape calumny Get thee to a
[SHK] nunnery go farewell Or if thou wilt needs
[SHK] marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough
[SHK] what monsters you make of them To a nunnery go
[SHK] and quickly too Farewell
[SHK] O heavenly powers restore him
[SHK] I have heard of your paintings too well enough God
[SHK] has given you one face and you make yourselves
[SHK] another you jig you amble and you lisp and
[SHK] nick-name God 's creatures and make your wantonness
[SHK] your ignorance Go to I 'll no more o n't it hath
[SHK] made me mad I say we will have no more marriages
[SHK] those that are married already all but one shall
[SHK] live the rest shall keep as they are To a
[SHK] nunnery go
[SHK] O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown
[SHK] The courtier 's soldier 's scholar 's eye tongue sword
[SHK] The expectancy and rose of the fair state
[SHK] The glass of fashion and the mould of form
[SHK] The observed of all observers quite quite down
[SHK] And I of ladies most deject and wretched
[SHK] That suck 'd the honey of his music vows
[SHK] Now see that noble and most sovereign reason
[SHK] Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
[SHK] That unmatch 'd form and feature of blown youth
[SHK] Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me
[SHK] To have seen what I have seen see what I see
[SHK] Love his affections do not that way tend
[SHK] Nor what he spake though it lack 'd form a little
[SHK] Was not like madness There 's something in his soul
[SHK] O'er which his melancholy sits on brood
[SHK] And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
[SHK] Will be some danger which for to prevent
[SHK] I have in quick determination
[SHK] Thus set it down he shall with speed to England
[SHK] For the demand of our neglected tribute
[SHK] Haply the seas and countries different
[SHK] With variable objects shall expel
[SHK] This something-settled matter in his heart
[SHK] Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
[SHK] From fashion of himself What think you o n't
[SHK] It shall do well but yet do I believe
[SHK] The origin and commencement of his grief
[SHK] Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
[SHK] You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
[SHK] We heard it all My lord do as you please
[SHK] But if you hold it fit after the play
[SHK] Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
[SHK] To show his grief let her be round with him
[SHK] And I 'll be placed so please you in the ear
[SHK] Of all their conference If she find him not
[SHK] To England send him or confine him where
[SHK] Your wisdom best shall think
[SHK] It shall be so
[SHK] Madness in great ones must not unwatch 'd go
[SHK] Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to
[SHK] you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it
[SHK] as many of your players do I had as lief the
[SHK] town-crier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air
[SHK] too much with your hand thus but use all gently
[SHK] for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say
[SHK] the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget
[SHK] a temperance that may give it smoothness O it
[SHK] offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
[SHK] periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to
[SHK] very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
[SHK] for the most part are capable of nothing but
[SHK] inexplicable dumbshows and noise I would have such
[SHK] a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant it
[SHK] out-herods Herod pray you avoid it
[SHK] I warrant your honour
[SHK] Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion
[SHK] be your tutor suit the action to the word the
[SHK] word to the action with this special o'erstep not
[SHK] the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is
[SHK] from the purpose of playing whose end both at the
[SHK] first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the
[SHK] mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
[SHK] scorn her own image and the very age and body of
[SHK] the time his form and pressure Now this overdone
[SHK] or come tardy off though it make the unskilful
[SHK] laugh can not but make the judicious grieve the
[SHK] censure of the which one must in your allowance
[SHK] o'erweigh a whole theatre of others O there be
[SHK] players that I have seen play and heard others
[SHK] praise and that highly not to speak it profanely
[SHK] that neither having the accent of Christians nor
[SHK] the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so
[SHK] strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
[SHK] nature 's journeymen had made men and not made them
[SHK] well they imitated humanity so abominably
[SHK] I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us
[SHK] sir
[SHK] O reform it altogether And let those that play
[SHK] your clowns speak no more than is set down for them
[SHK] for there be of them that will themselves laugh to
[SHK] set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
[SHK] too though in the mean time some necessary
[SHK] question of the play be then to be considered
[SHK] that 's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition
[SHK] in the fool that uses it Go make you ready
[SHK] How now my lord I will the king hear this piece of work
[SHK] And the queen too and that presently
[SHK] Bid the players make haste
[SHK] Will you two help to hasten them
[SHK] We will my lord
[SHK] What ho Horatio
[SHK] Here sweet lord at your service
[SHK] Horatio thou art e'en as just a man
[SHK] As e'er my conversation coped withal
[SHK] O my dear lord --
[SHK] Nay do not think I flatter
[SHK] For what advancement may I hope from thee
[SHK] That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
[SHK] To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flatter 'd
[SHK] No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
[SHK] And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
[SHK] Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear
[SHK] Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
[SHK] And could of men distinguish her election
[SHK] Hath seal 'd thee for herself for thou hast been
[SHK] As one in suffering all that suffers nothing
[SHK] A man that fortune 's buffets and rewards
[SHK] Hast ta'en with equal thanks and blest are those
[SHK] Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
[SHK] That they are not a pipe for fortune 's finger
[SHK] To sound what stop she please Give me that man
[SHK] That is not passion 's slave and I will wear him
[SHK] In my heart 's core ay in my heart of heart
[SHK] As I do thee. -- Something too much of this. --
[SHK] There is a play to-night before the king
[SHK] One scene of it comes near the circumstance
[SHK] Which I have told thee of my father 's death
[SHK] I prithee when thou seest that act afoot
[SHK] Even with the very comment of thy soul
[SHK] Observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt
[SHK] Do not itself unkennel in one speech
[SHK] It is a damned ghost that we have seen
[SHK] And my imaginations are as foul
[SHK] As Vulcan 's stithy Give him heedful note
[SHK] For I mine eyes will rivet to his face
[SHK] And after we will both our judgments join
[SHK] In censure of his seeming
[SHK] Well my lord
[SHK] If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
[SHK] And 'scape detecting I will pay the theft
[SHK] They are coming to the play I must be idle
[SHK] Get you a place
[SHK] How fares our cousin Hamlet
[SHK] Excellent i faith of the chameleon 's dish I eat
[SHK] the air promise-crammed you can not feed capons so
[SHK] I have nothing with this answer Hamlet these words
[SHK] are not mine
[SHK] No nor mine now
[SHK] My lord you played once i the university you say
[SHK] That did I my lord and was accounted a good actor
[SHK] What did you enact
[SHK] I did enact Julius Caesar I was killed i the
[SHK] Capitol Brutus killed me
[SHK] It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
[SHK] there Be the players ready
[SHK] Ay my lord they stay upon your patience
[SHK] Come hither my dear Hamlet sit by me
[SHK] No good mother here 's metal more attractive
[SHK] Lady shall I lie in your lap
[SHK] No my lord
[SHK] I mean my head upon your lap
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] Do you think I meant country matters
[SHK] I think nothing my lord
[SHK] That 's a fair thought to lie between maids legs
[SHK] What is my lord
[SHK] Nothing
[SHK] You are merry my lord
[SHK] Who I
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] O God your only jig-maker What should a man do
[SHK] but be merry for look you how cheerfully my
[SHK] mother looks and my father died within these two hours
[SHK] Nay 't is twice two months my lord
[SHK] So long Nay then let the devil wear black for
[SHK] I 'll have a suit of sables O heavens die two
[SHK] months ago and not forgotten yet Then there 's
[SHK] hope a great man 's memory may outlive his life half
[SHK] a year but by r lady he must build churches
[SHK] then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with
[SHK] the hobby-horse whose epitaph is 'For O for O
[SHK] the hobby-horse is forgot
[SHK] What means this my lord
[SHK] Marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief
[SHK] Belike this show imports the argument of the play
[SHK] We shall know by this fellow the players can not
[SHK] keep counsel they 'll tell all
[SHK] Will he tell us what this show meant
[SHK] Ay or any show that you 'll show him be not you
[SHK] ashamed to show he 'll not shame to tell you what it means
[SHK] You are naught you are naught I 'll mark the play
[SHK] For us and for our tragedy
[SHK] Here stooping to your clemency
[SHK] We beg your hearing patiently
[SHK] Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
[SHK] 'T is brief my lord
[SHK] As woman 's love
[SHK] Full thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone round
[SHK] Neptune 's salt wash and Tellus orbed ground
[SHK] And thirty dozen moons with borrow 'd sheen
[SHK] About the world have times twelve thirties been
[SHK] Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
[SHK] Unite commutual in most sacred bands
[SHK] So many journeys may the sun and moon
[SHK] Make us again count o'er ere love be done
[SHK] But woe is me you are so sick of late
[SHK] So far from cheer and from your former state
[SHK] That I distrust you Yet though I distrust
[SHK] Discomfort you my lord it nothing must
[SHK] For women 's fear and love holds quantity
[SHK] In neither aught or in extremity
[SHK] Now what my love is proof hath made you know
[SHK] And as my love is sized my fear is so
[SHK] Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
[SHK] Where little fears grow great great love grows there
[SHK] 'Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too
[SHK] My operant powers their functions leave to do
[SHK] And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
[SHK] Honour 'd beloved and haply one as kind
[SHK] For husband shalt thou --
[SHK] O confound the rest
[SHK] Such love must needs be treason in my breast
[SHK] In second husband let me be accurst
[SHK] None wed the second but who kill 'd the first
[SHK] The instances that second marriage move
[SHK] Are base respects of thrift but none of love
[SHK] A second time I kill my husband dead
[SHK] When second husband kisses me in bed
[SHK] I do believe you think what now you speak
[SHK] But what we do determine oft we break
[SHK] Purpose is but the slave to memory
[SHK] Of violent birth but poor validity
[SHK] Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
[SHK] But fall unshaken when they mellow be
[SHK] Most necessary 't is that we forget
[SHK] To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
[SHK] What to ourselves in passion we propose
[SHK] The passion ending doth the purpose lose
[SHK] The violence of either grief or joy
[SHK] Their own enactures with themselves destroy
[SHK] Where joy most revels grief doth most lament
[SHK] Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
[SHK] This world is not for aye nor 't is not strange
[SHK] That even our loves should with our fortunes change
[SHK] For 't is a question left us yet to prove
[SHK] Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
[SHK] The great man down you mark his favourite flies
[SHK] The poor advanced makes friends of enemies
[SHK] And hitherto doth love on fortune tend
[SHK] For who not needs shall never lack a friend
[SHK] And who in want a hollow friend doth try
[SHK] Directly seasons him his enemy
[SHK] But orderly to end where I begun
[SHK] Our wills and fates do so contrary run
[SHK] That our devices still are overthrown
[SHK] Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
[SHK] So think thou wilt no second husband wed
[SHK] But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
[SHK] Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
[SHK] Sport and repose lock from me day and night
[SHK] To desperation turn my trust and hope
[SHK] An anchor 's cheer in prison be my scope
[SHK] Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
[SHK] Meet what I would have well and it destroy
[SHK] Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
[SHK] If once a widow ever I be wife
[SHK] If she should break it now
[SHK] 'T is deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile
[SHK] My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile
[SHK] The tedious day with sleep
[SHK] Sleep rock thy brain
[SHK] And never come mischance between us twain
[SHK] Madam how like you this play
[SHK] The lady protests too much methinks
[SHK] O but she 'll keep her word
[SHK] Have you heard the argument Is there no offence in 't
[SHK] No no they do but jest poison in jest no offence
[SHK] i the world
[SHK] What do you call the play
[SHK] The Mouse-trap Marry how Tropically This play
[SHK] is the image of a murder done in Vienna Gonzago is
[SHK] the duke 's name his wife Baptista you shall see
[SHK] anon 't is a knavish piece of work but what o
[SHK] that your majesty and we that have free souls it
[SHK] touches us not let the galled jade wince our
[SHK] withers are unwrung
[SHK] This is one Lucianus nephew to the king
[SHK] You are as good as a chorus my lord
[SHK] I could interpret between you and your love if I
[SHK] could see the puppets dallying
[SHK] You are keen my lord you are keen
[SHK] It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
[SHK] Still better and worse
[SHK] So you must take your husbands Begin murderer
[SHK] pox leave thy damnable faces and begin Come
[SHK] 'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge
[SHK] Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
[SHK] Confederate season else no creature seeing
[SHK] Thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected
[SHK] With Hecate 's ban thrice blasted thrice infected
[SHK] Thy natural magic and dire property
[SHK] On wholesome life usurp immediately
[SHK] He poisons him i the garden for 's estate His
[SHK] name 's Gonzago the story is extant and writ in
[SHK] choice Italian you shall see anon how the murderer
[SHK] gets the love of Gonzago 's wife
[SHK] The king rises
[SHK] What frighted with false fire
[SHK] How fares my lord
[SHK] Give o'er the play
[SHK] Give me some light away
[SHK] Lights lights lights
[SHK] Why let the stricken deer go weep
[SHK] The hart ungalled play
[SHK] For some must watch while some must sleep
[SHK] So runs the world away
[SHK] Would not this sir and a forest of feathers -- if
[SHK] the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me -- with two
[SHK] Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a
[SHK] fellowship in a cry of players sir
[SHK] Half a share
[SHK] A whole one I
[SHK] For thou dost know O Damon dear
[SHK] This realm dismantled was
[SHK] Of Jove himself and now reigns here
[SHK] A very very -- pajock
[SHK] You might have rhymed
[SHK] O good Horatio I 'll take the ghost 's word for a
[SHK] thousand pound Didst perceive
[SHK] Very well my lord
[SHK] Upon the talk of the poisoning
[SHK] I did very well note him
[SHK] Ah ha Come some music come the recorders
[SHK] For if the king like not the comedy
[SHK] Why then belike he likes it not perdy
[SHK] Come some music
[SHK] Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you
[SHK] Sir a whole history
[SHK] The king sir --
[SHK] Ay sir what of him
[SHK] Is in his retirement marvellous distempered
[SHK] With drink sir
[SHK] No my lord rather with choler
[SHK] Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
[SHK] signify this to his doctor for for me to put him
[SHK] to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
[SHK] more choler
[SHK] Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and
[SHK] start not so wildly from my affair
[SHK] I am tame sir pronounce
[SHK] The queen your mother in most great affliction of
[SHK] spirit hath sent me to you
[SHK] You are welcome
[SHK] Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right
[SHK] breed If it shall please you to make me a
[SHK] wholesome answer I will do your mother 's
[SHK] commandment if not your pardon and my return
[SHK] shall be the end of my business
[SHK] Sir I can not
[SHK] What my lord
[SHK] Make you a wholesome answer my wit 's diseased but
[SHK] sir such answer as I can make you shall command
[SHK] or rather as you say my mother therefore no
[SHK] more but to the matter my mother you say --
[SHK] Then thus she says your behavior hath struck her
[SHK] into amazement and admiration
[SHK] O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother But
[SHK] is there no sequel at the heels of this mother 's
[SHK] admiration Impart
[SHK] She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you
[SHK] go to bed
[SHK] We shall obey were she ten times our mother Have
[SHK] you any further trade with us
[SHK] My lord you once did love me
[SHK] So I do still by these pickers and stealers
[SHK] Good my lord what is your cause of distemper you
[SHK] do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if
[SHK] you deny your griefs to your friend
[SHK] Sir I lack advancement
[SHK] How can that be when you have the voice of the king
[SHK] himself for your succession in Denmark
[SHK] Ay but sir 'While the grass grows -- the proverb
[SHK] is something musty
[SHK] O the recorders let me see one To withdraw with
[SHK] you -- why do you go about to recover the wind of me
[SHK] as if you would drive me into a toil
[SHK] O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too
[SHK] unmannerly
[SHK] I do not well understand that Will you play upon
[SHK] this pipe
[SHK] My lord I can not
[SHK] I pray you
[SHK] Believe me I can not
[SHK] I do beseech you
[SHK] I know no touch of it my lord
[SHK] 'T is as easy as lying govern these ventages with
[SHK] your lingers and thumb give it breath with your
[SHK] mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
[SHK] Look you these are the stops
[SHK] But these can not I command to any utterance of
[SHK] harmony I have not the skill
[SHK] Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of
[SHK] me You would play upon me you would seem to know
[SHK] my stops you would pluck out the heart of my
[SHK] mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to
[SHK] the top of my compass and there is much music
[SHK] excellent voice in this little organ yet can not
[SHK] you make it speak 'Sblood do you think I am
[SHK] easier to be played on than a pipe Call me what
[SHK] instrument you will though you can fret me yet you
[SHK] can not play upon me
[SHK] God bless you sir
[SHK] My lord the queen would speak with you and
[SHK] presently
[SHK] Do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a camel
[SHK] By the mass and 't is like a camel indeed
[SHK] Methinks it is like a weasel
[SHK] It is backed like a weasel
[SHK] Or like a whale
[SHK] Very like a whale
[SHK] Then I will come to my mother by and by They fool
[SHK] me to the top of my bent I will come by and by
[SHK] I will say so
[SHK] By and by is easily said
[SHK] Leave me friends
[SHK] Tis now the very witching time of night
[SHK] When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
[SHK] Contagion to this world now could I drink hot blood
[SHK] And do such bitter business as the day
[SHK] Would quake to look on Soft now to my mother
[SHK] O heart lose not thy nature let not ever
[SHK] The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
[SHK] Let me be cruel not unnatural
[SHK] I will speak daggers to her but use none
[SHK] My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
[SHK] How in my words soever she be shent
[SHK] To give them seals never my soul consent
[SHK] I like him not nor stands it safe with us
[SHK] To let his madness range Therefore prepare you
[SHK] I your commission will forthwith dispatch
[SHK] And he to England shall along with you
[SHK] The terms of our estate may not endure
[SHK] Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
[SHK] Out of his lunacies
[SHK] We will ourselves provide
[SHK] Most holy and religious fear it is
[SHK] To keep those many many bodies safe
[SHK] That live and feed upon your majesty
[SHK] The single and peculiar life is bound
[SHK] With all the strength and armour of the mind
[SHK] To keep itself from noyance but much more
[SHK] That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
[SHK] The lives of many The cease of majesty
[SHK] Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
[SHK] What 's near it with it it is a massy wheel
[SHK] Fix 'd on the summit of the highest mount
[SHK] To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
[SHK] Are mortised and adjoin 'd which when it falls
[SHK] Each small annexment petty consequence
[SHK] Attends the boisterous ruin Never alone
[SHK] Did the king sigh but with a general groan
[SHK] Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage
[SHK] For we will fetters put upon this fear
[SHK] Which now goes too free-footed
[SHK] We will haste us
[SHK] My lord he 's going to his mother 's closet
[SHK] Behind the arras I 'll convey myself
[SHK] To hear the process and warrant she 'll tax him home
[SHK] And as you said and wisely was it said
[SHK] 'T is meet that some more audience than a mother
[SHK] Since nature makes them partial should o'erhear
[SHK] The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege
[SHK] I 'll call upon you ere you go to bed
[SHK] And tell you what I know
[SHK] Thanks dear my lord
[SHK] O my offence is rank it smells to heaven
[SHK] It hath the primal eldest curse upo n't
[SHK] A brother 's murder Pray can I not
[SHK] Though inclination be as sharp as will
[SHK] My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
[SHK] And like a man to double business bound
[SHK] I stand in pause where I shall first begin
[SHK] And both neglect What if this cursed hand
[SHK] Were thicker than itself with brother 's blood
[SHK] Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
[SHK] To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy
[SHK] But to confront the visage of offence
[SHK] And what 's in prayer but this two-fold force
[SHK] To be forestalled ere we come to fall
[SHK] Or pardon 'd being down Then I 'll look up
[SHK] My fault is past But O what form of prayer
[SHK] Can serve my turn 'Forgive me my foul murder
[SHK] That can not be since I am still possess 'd
[SHK] Of those effects for which I did the murder
[SHK] My crown mine own ambition and my queen
[SHK] May one be pardon 'd and retain the offence
[SHK] In the corrupted currents of this world
[SHK] Offence 's gilded hand may shove by justice
[SHK] And oft 't is seen the wicked prize itself
[SHK] Buys out the law but 't is not so above
[SHK] There is no shuffling there the action lies
[SHK] In his true nature and we ourselves compell 'd
[SHK] Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
[SHK] To give in evidence What then what rests
[SHK] Try what repentance can what can it not
[SHK] Yet what can it when one can not repent
[SHK] O wretched state O bosom black as death
[SHK] O limed soul that struggling to be free
[SHK] Art more engaged Help angels Make assay
[SHK] Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
[SHK] Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
[SHK] All may be well
[SHK] Now might I do it pat now he is praying
[SHK] And now I 'll do't And so he goes to heaven
[SHK] And so am I revenged That would be scann 'd
[SHK] A villain kills my father and for that
[SHK] I his sole son do this same villain send
[SHK] To heaven
[SHK] O this is hire and salary not revenge
[SHK] He took my father grossly full of bread
[SHK] With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
[SHK] And how his audit stands who knows save heaven
[SHK] But in our circumstance and course of thought
[SHK] 'T is heavy with him and am I then revenged
[SHK] To take him in the purging of his soul
[SHK] When he is fit and season 'd for his passage
[SHK] No
[SHK] Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
[SHK] When he is drunk asleep or in his rage
[SHK] Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed
[SHK] At gaming swearing or about some act
[SHK] That has no relish of salvation i n't
[SHK] Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
[SHK] And that his soul may be as damn 'd and black
[SHK] As hell whereto it goes My mother stays
[SHK] This physic but prolongs thy sickly days
[SHK] Words without thoughts never to heaven go
[SHK] He will come straight Look you lay home to him
[SHK] Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
[SHK] And that your grace hath screen 'd and stood between
[SHK] Much heat and him I 'll sconce me even here
[SHK] Pray you be round with him
[SHK] I 'll warrant you
[SHK] Fear me not withdraw I hear him coming
[SHK] Now mother what 's the matter
[SHK] Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
[SHK] Mother you have my father much offended
[SHK] Come come you answer with an idle tongue
[SHK] Go go you question with a wicked tongue
[SHK] Why how now Hamlet
[SHK] What 's the matter now
[SHK] Have you forgot me
[SHK] No by the rood not so
[SHK] You are the queen your husband 's brother 's wife
[SHK] And -- would it were not so -- you are my mother
[SHK] Nay then I 'll set those to you that can speak
[SHK] Come come and sit you down you shall not budge
[SHK] You go not till I set you up a glass
[SHK] Where you may see the inmost part of you
[SHK] What wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me
[SHK] Help help ho
[SHK] O me what hast thou done
[SHK] Nay I know not
[SHK] Is it the king
[SHK] O what a rash and bloody deed is this
[SHK] A bloody deed almost as bad good mother
[SHK] As kill a king and marry with his brother
[SHK] As kill a king
[SHK] Ay lady 't was my word
[SHK] Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
[SHK] I took thee for thy better take thy fortune
[SHK] Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger
[SHK] Leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
[SHK] And let me wring your heart for so I shall
[SHK] If it be made of penetrable stuff
[SHK] If damned custom have not brass 'd it so
[SHK] That it is proof and bulwark against sense
[SHK] What have I done that thou darest wag thy tongue
[SHK] In noise so rude against me
[SHK] Such an act
[SHK] That blurs the grace and blush of modesty
[SHK] Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
[SHK] From the fair forehead of an innocent love
[SHK] And sets a blister there makes marriage-vows
[SHK] As false as dicers oaths O such a deed
[SHK] As from the body of contraction plucks
[SHK] The very soul and sweet religion makes
[SHK] A rhapsody of words heaven 's face doth glow
[SHK] Yea this solidity and compound mass
[SHK] With tristful visage as against the doom
[SHK] Is thought-sick at the act
[SHK] Ay me what act
[SHK] That roars so loud and thunders in the index
[SHK] Look here upon this picture and on this
[SHK] The counterfeit presentment of two brothers
[SHK] See what a grace was seated on this brow
[SHK] Hyperion 's curls the front of Jove himself
[SHK] An eye like Mars to threaten and command
[SHK] A station like the herald Mercury
[SHK] New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill
[SHK] A combination and a form indeed
[SHK] Where every god did seem to set his seal
[SHK] To give the world assurance of a man
[SHK] This was your husband Look you now what follows
[SHK] Here is your husband like a mildew 'd ear
[SHK] Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes
[SHK] Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
[SHK] And batten on this moor Ha have you eyes
[SHK] You can not call it love for at your age
[SHK] The hey-day in the blood is tame it 's humble
[SHK] And waits upon the judgment and what judgment
[SHK] Would step from this to this Sense sure you have
[SHK] Else could you not have motion but sure that sense
[SHK] Is apoplex 'd for madness would not err
[SHK] Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall 'd
[SHK] But it reserved some quantity of choice
[SHK] To serve in such a difference What devil was't
[SHK] That thus hath cozen 'd you at hoodman-blind
[SHK] Eyes without feeling feeling without sight
[SHK] Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
[SHK] Or but a sickly part of one true sense
[SHK] Could not so mope
[SHK] O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell
[SHK] If thou canst mutine in a matron 's bones
[SHK] To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
[SHK] And melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
[SHK] When the compulsive ardour gives the charge
[SHK] Since frost itself as actively doth burn
[SHK] And reason panders will
[SHK] O Hamlet speak no more
[SHK] Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul
[SHK] And there I see such black and grained spots
[SHK] As will not leave their tinct
[SHK] Nay but to live
[SHK] In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
[SHK] Stew 'd in corruption honeying and making love
[SHK] Over the nasty sty --
[SHK] O speak to me no more
[SHK] These words like daggers enter in mine ears
[SHK] No more sweet Hamlet
[SHK] A murderer and a villain
[SHK] A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
[SHK] Of your precedent lord a vice of kings
[SHK] A cutpurse of the empire and the rule
[SHK] That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
[SHK] And put it in his pocket
[SHK] No more
[SHK] A king of shreds and patches --
[SHK] Save me and hover o'er me with your wings
[SHK] You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure
[SHK] Alas he 's mad
[SHK] Do you not come your tardy son to chide
[SHK] That lapsed in time and passion lets go by
[SHK] The important acting of your dread command O say
[SHK] Do not forget this visitation
[SHK] Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
[SHK] But look amazement on thy mother sits
[SHK] O step between her and her fighting soul
[SHK] Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
[SHK] Speak to her Hamlet
[SHK] How is it with you lady
[SHK] Alas how is't with you
[SHK] That you do bend your eye on vacancy
[SHK] And with the incorporal air do hold discourse
[SHK] Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
[SHK] And as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm
[SHK] Your bedded hair like life in excrements
[SHK] Starts up and stands on end O gentle son
[SHK] Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
[SHK] Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look
[SHK] On him on him Look you how pale he glares
[SHK] His form and cause conjoin 'd preaching to stones
[SHK] Would make them capable Do not look upon me
[SHK] Lest with this piteous action you convert
[SHK] My stern effects then what I have to do
[SHK] Will want true colour tears perchance for blood
[SHK] To whom do you speak this
[SHK] Do you see nothing there
[SHK] Nothing at all yet all that is I see
[SHK] Nor did you nothing hear
[SHK] No nothing but ourselves
[SHK] Why look you there look how it steals away
[SHK] My father in his habit as he lived
[SHK] Look where he goes even now out at the portal
[SHK] This the very coinage of your brain
[SHK] This bodiless creation ecstasy
[SHK] Is very cunning in
[SHK] Ecstasy
[SHK] My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
[SHK] And makes as healthful music it is not madness
[SHK] That I have utter 'd bring me to the test
[SHK] And I the matter will re-word which madness
[SHK] Would gambol from Mother for love of grace
[SHK] Lay not that mattering unction to your soul
[SHK] That not your trespass but my madness speaks
[SHK] It will but skin and film the ulcerous place
[SHK] Whilst rank corruption mining all within
[SHK] Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven
[SHK] Repent what 's past avoid what is to come
[SHK] And do not spread the compost on the weeds
[SHK] To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue
[SHK] For in the fatness of these pursy times
[SHK] Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
[SHK] Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
[SHK] O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
[SHK] O throw away the worser part of it
[SHK] And live the purer with the other half
[SHK] Good night but go not to mine uncle 's bed
[SHK] Assume a virtue if you have it not
[SHK] That monster custom who all sense doth eat
[SHK] Of habits devil is angel yet in this
[SHK] That to the use of actions fair and good
[SHK] He likewise gives a frock or livery
[SHK] That aptly is put on Refrain to-night
[SHK] And that shall lend a kind of easiness
[SHK] To the next abstinence the next more easy
[SHK] For use almost can change the stamp of nature
[SHK] And either ... the devil or throw him out
[SHK] With wondrous potency Once more good night
[SHK] And when you are desirous to be bless 'd
[SHK] I 'll blessing beg of you For this same lord
[SHK] I do repent but heaven hath pleased it so
[SHK] To punish me with this and this with me
[SHK] That I must be their scourge and minister
[SHK] I will bestow him and will answer well
[SHK] The death I gave him So again good night
[SHK] I must be cruel only to be kind
[SHK] Thus bad begins and worse remains behind
[SHK] One word more good lady
[SHK] What shall I do
[SHK] Not this by no means that I bid you do
[SHK] Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
[SHK] Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
[SHK] And let him for a pair of reechy kisses
[SHK] Or paddling in your neck with his damn 'd fingers
[SHK] Make you to ravel all this matter out
[SHK] That I essentially am not in madness
[SHK] But mad in craft 'Twere good you let him know
[SHK] For who that 's but a queen fair sober wise
[SHK] Would from a paddock from a bat a gib
[SHK] Such dear concernings hide who would do so
[SHK] No in despite of sense and secrecy
[SHK] Unpeg the basket on the house 's top
[SHK] Let the birds fly and like the famous ape
[SHK] To try conclusions in the basket creep
[SHK] And break your own neck down
[SHK] Be thou assured if words be made of breath
[SHK] And breath of life I have no life to breathe
[SHK] What thou hast said to me
[SHK] I must to England you know that
[SHK] Alack
[SHK] I had forgot 't is so concluded on
[SHK] There 's letters seal 'd and my two schoolfellows
[SHK] Whom I will trust as I will adders fang 'd
[SHK] They bear the mandate they must sweep my way
[SHK] And marshal me to knavery Let it work
[SHK] For 't is the sport to have the engineer
[SHK] Hoist with his own petard and 't shall go hard
[SHK] But I will delve one yard below their mines
[SHK] And blow them at the moon O 't is most sweet
[SHK] When in one line two crafts directly meet
[SHK] This man shall set me packing
[SHK] I 'll lug the guts into the neighbour room
[SHK] Mother good night Indeed this counsellor
[SHK] Is now most still most secret and most grave
[SHK] Who was in life a foolish prating knave
[SHK] Come sir to draw toward an end with you
[SHK] Good night mother
[SHK] There 's matter in these sighs these profound heaves
[SHK] You must translate 't is fit we understand them
[SHK] Where is your son
[SHK] Bestow this place on us a little while
[SHK] Ah my good lord what have I seen to-night
[SHK] What Gertrude How does Hamlet
[SHK] Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
[SHK] Which is the mightier in his lawless fit
[SHK] Behind the arras hearing something stir
[SHK] Whips out his rapier cries A rat a rat
[SHK] And in this brainish apprehension kills
[SHK] The unseen good old man
[SHK] O heavy deed
[SHK] It had been so with us had we been there
[SHK] His liberty is full of threats to all
[SHK] To you yourself to us to every one
[SHK] Alas how shall this bloody deed be answer 'd
[SHK] It will be laid to us whose providence
[SHK] Should have kept short restrain 'd and out of haunt
[SHK] This mad young man but so much was our love
[SHK] We would not understand what was most fit
[SHK] But like the owner of a foul disease
[SHK] To keep it from divulging let it feed
[SHK] Even on the pith of Life Where is he gone
[SHK] To draw apart the body he hath kill 'd
[SHK] O'er whom his very madness like some ore
[SHK] Among a mineral of metals base
[SHK] Shows itself pure he weeps for what is done
[SHK] O Gertrude come away
[SHK] The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
[SHK] But we will ship him hence and this vile deed
[SHK] We must with all our majesty and skill
[SHK] Both countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern
[SHK] Friends both go join you with some further aid
[SHK] Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
[SHK] And from his mother 's closet hath he dragg 'd him
[SHK] Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
[SHK] Into the chapel I pray you haste in this
[SHK] Come Gertrude we 'll call up our wisest friends
[SHK] And let them know both what we mean to do
[SHK] And what 's untimely done ...
[SHK] Whose whisper o'er the world 's diameter
[SHK] As level as the cannon to his blank
[SHK] Transports his poison 'd shot may miss our name
[SHK] And hit the woundless air O come away
[SHK] My soul is full of discord and dismay
[SHK] Safely stowed
[SHK] What noise who calls on Hamlet
[SHK] O here they come
[SHK] What have you done my lord with the dead body
[SHK] Compounded it with dust whereto 't is kin
[SHK] Tell us where 't is that we may take it thence
[SHK] And bear it to the chapel
[SHK] Do not believe it
[SHK] Believe what
[SHK] That I can keep your counsel and not mine own
[SHK] Besides to be demanded of a sponge what
[SHK] replication should be made by the son of a king
[SHK] Take you me for a sponge my lord
[SHK] Ay sir that soaks up the king 's countenance his
[SHK] rewards his authorities But such officers do the
[SHK] king best service in the end he keeps them like
[SHK] an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to
[SHK] be last swallowed when he needs what you have
[SHK] gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you
[SHK] shall be dry again
[SHK] I understand you not my lord
[SHK] I am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a
[SHK] foolish ear
[SHK] My lord you must tell us where the body is and go
[SHK] with us to the king
[SHK] The body is with the king but the king is not with
[SHK] the body The king is a thing --
[SHK] A thing my lord
[SHK] Of nothing bring me to him Hide fox and all after
[SHK] I have sent to seek him and to find the body
[SHK] How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
[SHK] Yet must not we put the strong law on him
[SHK] He 's loved of the distracted multitude
[SHK] Who like not in their judgment but their eyes
[SHK] And where tis so the offender 's scourge is weigh 'd
[SHK] But never the offence To bear all smooth and even
[SHK] This sudden sending him away must seem
[SHK] Deliberate pause diseases desperate grown
[SHK] By desperate appliance are relieved
[SHK] Or not at all
[SHK] How now what hath befall'n
[SHK] Where the dead body is bestow 'd my lord
[SHK] We can not get from him
[SHK] But where is he
[SHK] Without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
[SHK] Bring him before us
[SHK] Ho Guildenstern bring in my lord
[SHK] Now Hamlet where 's Polonius
[SHK] At supper
[SHK] At supper where
[SHK] Not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain
[SHK] convocation of politic worms are e'en at him Your
[SHK] worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all
[SHK] creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for
[SHK] maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but
[SHK] variable service two dishes but to one table
[SHK] that 's the end
[SHK] Alas alas
[SHK] A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
[SHK] king and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm
[SHK] What dost you mean by this
[SHK] Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
[SHK] progress through the guts of a beggar
[SHK] Where is Polonius
[SHK] In heaven send hither to see if your messenger
[SHK] find him not there seek him i the other place
[SHK] yourself But indeed if you find him not within
[SHK] this month you shall nose him as you go up the
[SHK] stairs into the lobby
[SHK] Go seek him there
[SHK] He will stay till ye come
[SHK] Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety --
[SHK] Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
[SHK] For that which thou hast done -- must send thee hence
[SHK] With fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself
[SHK] The bark is ready and the wind at help
[SHK] The associates tend and every thing is bent
[SHK] For England
[SHK] For England
[SHK] Ay Hamlet
[SHK] Good
[SHK] So is it if thou knew'st our purposes
[SHK] I see a cherub that sees them But come for
[SHK] England Farewell dear mother
[SHK] Thy loving father Hamlet
[SHK] My mother father and mother is man and wife man
[SHK] and wife is one flesh and so my mother Come for England
[SHK] Follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard
[SHK] Delay it not I 'll have him hence to-night
[SHK] Away for every thing is seal 'd and done
[SHK] That else leans on the affair pray you make haste
[SHK] And England if my love thou hold'st at aught --
[SHK] As my great power thereof may give thee sense
[SHK] Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
[SHK] After the Danish sword and thy free awe
[SHK] Pays homage to us -- thou mayst not coldly set
[SHK] Our sovereign process which imports at full
[SHK] By letters congruing to that effect
[SHK] The present death of Hamlet Do it England
[SHK] For like the hectic in my blood he rages
[SHK] And thou must cure me till I know 't is done
[SHK] Howe'er my haps my joys were ne'er begun
[SHK] Go captain from me greet the Danish king
[SHK] Tell him that by his licence Fortinbras
[SHK] Craves the conveyance of a promised march
[SHK] Over his kingdom You know the rendezvous
[SHK] If that his majesty would aught with us
[SHK] We shall express our duty in his eye
[SHK] And let him know so
[SHK] I will do't my lord
[SHK] Go softly on
[SHK] Good sir whose powers are these
[SHK] They are of Norway sir
[SHK] How purposed sir I pray you
[SHK] Against some part of Poland
[SHK] Who commands them sir
[SHK] The nephews to old Norway Fortinbras
[SHK] Goes it against the main of Poland sir
[SHK] Or for some frontier
[SHK] Truly to speak and with no addition
[SHK] We go to gain a little patch of ground
[SHK] That hath in it no profit but the name
[SHK] To pay five ducats five I would not farm it
[SHK] Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
[SHK] A ranker rate should it be sold in fee
[SHK] Why then the Polack never will defend it
[SHK] Yes it is already garrison 'd
[SHK] Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
[SHK] Will not debate the question of this straw
[SHK] This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace
[SHK] That inward breaks and shows no cause without
[SHK] Why the man dies I humbly thank you sir
[SHK] God be wi you sir
[SHK] Wilt please you go my lord
[SHK] I 'll be with you straight go a little before
[SHK] How all occasions do inform against me
[SHK] And spur my dull revenge What is a man
[SHK] If his chief good and market of his time
[SHK] Be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
[SHK] Sure he that made us with such large discourse
[SHK] Looking before and after gave us not
[SHK] That capability and god-like reason
[SHK] To fust in us unused Now whether it be
[SHK] Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
[SHK] Of thinking too precisely on the event
[SHK] A thought which quarter 'd hath but one part wisdom
[SHK] And ever three parts coward I do not know
[SHK] Why yet I live to say 'This thing 's to do
[SHK] Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
[SHK] To do't Examples gross as earth exhort me
[SHK] Witness this army of such mass and charge
[SHK] Led by a delicate and tender prince
[SHK] Whose spirit with divine ambition puff 'd
[SHK] Makes mouths at the invisible event
[SHK] Exposing what is mortal and unsure
[SHK] To all that fortune death and danger dare
[SHK] Even for an egg-shell Rightly to be great
[SHK] Is not to stir without great argument
[SHK] But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
[SHK] When honour 's at the stake How stand I then
[SHK] That have a father kill 'd a mother stain 'd
[SHK] Excitements of my reason and my blood
[SHK] And let all sleep while to my shame I see
[SHK] The imminent death of twenty thousand men
[SHK] That for a fantasy and trick of fame
[SHK] Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
[SHK] Whereon the numbers can not try the cause
[SHK] Which is not tomb enough and continent
[SHK] To hide the slain O from this time forth
[SHK] My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
[SHK] I will not speak with her
[SHK] She is importunate indeed distract
[SHK] Her mood will needs be pitied
[SHK] What would she have
[SHK] She speaks much of her father says she hears
[SHK] There 's tricks i the world and hems and beats her heart
[SHK] Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
[SHK] That carry but half sense her speech is nothing
[SHK] Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
[SHK] The hearers to collection they aim at it
[SHK] And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
[SHK] Which as her winks and nods and gestures
[SHK] yield them
[SHK] Indeed would make one think there might be thought
[SHK] Though nothing sure yet much unhappily
[SHK] 'Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
[SHK] Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds
[SHK] Let her come in
[SHK] To my sick soul as sin 's true nature is
[SHK] Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
[SHK] So full of artless jealousy is guilt
[SHK] It spills itself in fearing to be spilt
[SHK] Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark
[SHK] How now Ophelia
[SHK] How should I your true love know
[SHK] From another one
[SHK] By his cockle hat and staff
[SHK] And his sandal shoon
[SHK] Alas sweet lady what imports this song
[SHK] Say you nay pray you mark
[SHK] He is dead and gone lady
[SHK] He is dead and gone
[SHK] At his head a grass-green turf
[SHK] At his heels a stone
[SHK] Nay but Ophelia --
[SHK] Pray you mark
[SHK] White his shroud as the mountain snow --
[SHK] Alas look here my lord
[SHK] Larded with sweet flowers
[SHK] Which bewept to the grave did go
[SHK] With true-love showers
[SHK] How do you pretty lady
[SHK] Well God 'ild you They say the owl was a baker 's
[SHK] daughter Lord we know what we are but know not
[SHK] what we may be God be at your table
[SHK] Conceit upon her father
[SHK] Pray you let 's have no words of this but when they
[SHK] ask you what it means say you this
[SHK] To-morrow is Saint Valentine 's day
[SHK] All in the morning betime
[SHK] And I a maid at your window
[SHK] To be your Valentine
[SHK] Then up he rose and donn 'd his clothes
[SHK] And dupp 'd the chamber-door
[SHK] Let in the maid that out a maid
[SHK] Never departed more
[SHK] Pretty Ophelia
[SHK] Indeed la without an oath I 'll make an end o n't
[SHK] By Gis and by Saint Charity
[SHK] Alack and fie for shame
[SHK] Young men will do't if they come to't
[SHK] By cock they are to blame
[SHK] Quoth she before you tumbled me
[SHK] You promised me to wed
[SHK] So would I ha done by yonder sun
[SHK] An thou hadst not come to my bed
[SHK] How long hath she been thus
[SHK] I hope all will be well We must be patient but I
[SHK] can not choose but weep to think they should lay him
[SHK] i the cold ground My brother shall know of it
[SHK] and so I thank you for your good counsel Come my
[SHK] coach Good night ladies good night sweet ladies
[SHK] good night good night
[SHK] Follow her close give her good watch
[SHK] I pray you
[SHK] O this is the poison of deep grief it springs
[SHK] All from her father 's death O Gertrude Gertrude
[SHK] When sorrows come they come not single spies
[SHK] But in battalions First her father slain
[SHK] Next your son gone and he most violent author
[SHK] Of his own just remove the people muddied
[SHK] Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
[SHK] For good Polonius death and we have done but greenly
[SHK] In hugger-mugger to inter him poor Ophelia
[SHK] Divided from herself and her fair judgment
[SHK] Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
[SHK] Last and as much containing as all these
[SHK] Her brother is in secret come from France
[SHK] Feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds
[SHK] And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
[SHK] With pestilent speeches of his father 's death
[SHK] Wherein necessity of matter beggar 'd
[SHK] Will nothing stick our person to arraign
[SHK] In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this
[SHK] Like to a murdering-piece in many places
[SHK] Gives me superfluous death
[SHK] Alack what noise is this
[SHK] Where are my Switzers Let them guard the door
[SHK] What is the matter
[SHK] Save yourself my lord
[SHK] The ocean overpeering of his list
[SHK] Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
[SHK] Than young Laertes in a riotous head
[SHK] O'erbears your officers The rabble call him lord
[SHK] And as the world were now but to begin
[SHK] Antiquity forgot custom not known
[SHK] The ratifiers and props of every word
[SHK] They cry 'Choose we Laertes shall be king
[SHK] Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
[SHK] 'Laertes shall be king Laertes king
[SHK] How cheerfully on the false trail they cry
[SHK] O this is counter you false Danish dogs
[SHK] The doors are broke
[SHK] Where is this king Sirs stand you all without
[SHK] No let 's come in
[SHK] I pray you give me leave
[SHK] We will we will
[SHK] I thank you keep the door O thou vile king
[SHK] Give me my father
[SHK] Calmly good Laertes
[SHK] That drop of blood that 's calm proclaims me bastard
[SHK] Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
[SHK] Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
[SHK] Of my true mother
[SHK] What is the cause Laertes
[SHK] That thy rebellion looks so giant-like
[SHK] Let him go Gertrude do not fear our person
[SHK] There 's such divinity doth hedge a king
[SHK] That treason can but peep to what it would
[SHK] Acts little of his will Tell me Laertes
[SHK] Why thou art thus incensed Let him go Gertrude
[SHK] Speak man
[SHK] Where is my father
[SHK] Dead
[SHK] But not by him
[SHK] Let him demand his fill
[SHK] How came he dead I 'll not be juggled with
[SHK] To hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
[SHK] Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
[SHK] I dare damnation To this point I stand
[SHK] That both the worlds I give to negligence
[SHK] Let come what comes only I 'll be revenged
[SHK] Most thoroughly for my father
[SHK] Who shall stay you
[SHK] My will not all the world
[SHK] And for my means I 'll husband them so well
[SHK] They shall go far with little
[SHK] Good Laertes
[SHK] If you desire to know the certainty
[SHK] Of your dear father 's death is't writ in your revenge
[SHK] That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
[SHK] Winner and loser
[SHK] None but his enemies
[SHK] Will you know them then
[SHK] To his good friends thus wide I 'll ope my arms
[SHK] And like the kind life-rendering pelican
[SHK] Repast them with my blood
[SHK] Why now you speak
[SHK] Like a good child and a true gentleman
[SHK] That I am guiltless of your father 's death
[SHK] And am most sensible in grief for it
[SHK] It shall as level to your judgment pierce
[SHK] As day does to your eye
[SHK] How now what noise is that
[SHK] O heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt
[SHK] Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
[SHK] By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
[SHK] Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May
[SHK] Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
[SHK] O heavens is't possible a young maid 's wits
[SHK] Should be as moral as an old man 's life
[SHK] Nature is fine in love and where 't is fine
[SHK] It sends some precious instance of itself
[SHK] After the thing it loves
[SHK] They bore him barefaced on the bier
[SHK] Hey non nonny nonny hey nonny
[SHK] And in his grave rain 'd many a tear --
[SHK] Fare you well my dove
[SHK] Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
[SHK] It could not move thus
[SHK] You must sing a-down a-down
[SHK] An you call him a-down-a
[SHK] O how the wheel becomes it It is the false
[SHK] steward that stole his master 's daughter
[SHK] This nothing 's more than matter
[SHK] There 's rosemary that 's for remembrance pray
[SHK] love remember and there is pansies that 's for thoughts
[SHK] A document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
[SHK] There 's fennel for you and columbines there 's rue
[SHK] for you and here 's some for me we may call it
[SHK] herb-grace o Sundays O you must wear your rue with
[SHK] a difference There 's a daisy I would give you
[SHK] some violets but they withered all when my father
[SHK] died they say he made a good end --
[SHK] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy
[SHK] Thought and affliction passion hell itself
[SHK] She turns to favour and to prettiness
[SHK] And will he not come again
[SHK] And will he not come again
[SHK] No no he is dead
[SHK] Go to thy death-bed
[SHK] He never will come again
[SHK] His beard was as white as snow
[SHK] All flaxen was his poll
[SHK] He is gone he is gone
[SHK] And we cast away moan
[SHK] God ha mercy on his soul
[SHK] And of all Christian souls I pray God God be wi ye
[SHK] Do you see this O God
[SHK] Laertes I must commune with your grief
[SHK] Or you deny me right Go but apart
[SHK] Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
[SHK] And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me
[SHK] If by direct or by collateral hand
[SHK] They find us touch 'd we will our kingdom give
[SHK] Our crown our life and all that we can ours
[SHK] To you in satisfaction but if not
[SHK] Be you content to lend your patience to us
[SHK] And we shall jointly labour with your soul
[SHK] To give it due content
[SHK] Let this be so
[SHK] His means of death his obscure funeral --
[SHK] No trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones
[SHK] No noble rite nor formal ostentation --
[SHK] Cry to be heard as 'twere from heaven to earth
[SHK] That I must call't in question
[SHK] So you shall
[SHK] And where the offence is let the great axe fall
[SHK] I pray you go with me
[SHK] What are they that would speak with me
[SHK] Sailors sir they say they have letters for you
[SHK] Let them come in
[SHK] I do not know from what part of the world
[SHK] I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet
[SHK] God bless you sir
[SHK] Let him bless thee too
[SHK] He shall sir a n't please him There 's a letter for
[SHK] you sir it comes from the ambassador that was
[SHK] bound for England if your name be Horatio as I am
[SHK] let to know it is
[SHK] this give these fellows some means to the king
[SHK] they have letters for him Ere we were two days old
[SHK] at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
[SHK] chase Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on
[SHK] a compelled valour and in the grapple I boarded
[SHK] them on the instant they got clear of our ship so
[SHK] I alone became their prisoner They have dealt with
[SHK] me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they
[SHK] did I am to do a good turn for them Let the king
[SHK] have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me
[SHK] with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death I
[SHK] have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
[SHK] dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of
[SHK] the matter These good fellows will bring thee
[SHK] where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
[SHK] course for England of them I have much to tell
[SHK] thee Farewell
[SHK] 'He that thou knowest thine HAMLET
[SHK] Come I will make you way for these your letters
[SHK] And do't the speedier that you may direct me
[SHK] To him from whom you brought them
[SHK] Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal
[SHK] And you must put me in your heart for friend
[SHK] Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
[SHK] That he which hath your noble father slain
[SHK] Pursued my life
[SHK] It well appears but tell me
[SHK] Why you proceeded not against these feats
[SHK] So crimeful and so capital in nature
[SHK] As by your safety wisdom all things else
[SHK] You mainly were stirr 'd up
[SHK] O for two special reasons
[SHK] Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew 'd
[SHK] But yet to me they are strong The queen his mother
[SHK] Lives almost by his looks and for myself --
[SHK] My virtue or my plague be it either which --
[SHK] She 's so conjunctive to my life and soul
[SHK] That as the star moves not but in his sphere
[SHK] I could not but by her The other motive
[SHK] Why to a public count I might not go
[SHK] Is the great love the general gender bear him
[SHK] Who dipping all his faults in their affection
[SHK] Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
[SHK] Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
[SHK] Too slightly timber 'd for so loud a wind
[SHK] Would have reverted to my bow again
[SHK] And not where I had aim 'd them
[SHK] And so have I a noble father lost
[SHK] A sister driven into desperate terms
[SHK] Whose worth if praises may go back again
[SHK] Stood challenger on mount of all the age
[SHK] For her perfections but my revenge will come
[SHK] Break not your sleeps for that you must not think
[SHK] That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
[SHK] That we can let our beard be shook with danger
[SHK] And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more
[SHK] I loved your father and we love ourself
[SHK] And that I hope will teach you to imagine --
[SHK] How now what news
[SHK] Letters my lord from Hamlet
[SHK] This to your majesty this to the queen
[SHK] From Hamlet who brought them
[SHK] Sailors my lord they say I saw them not
[SHK] They were given me by Claudio he received them
[SHK] Of him that brought them
[SHK] Laertes you shall hear them Leave us
[SHK] 'High and mighty You shall know I am set naked on
[SHK] your kingdom To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
[SHK] your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your
[SHK] pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden
[SHK] and more strange return 'HAMLET
[SHK] What should this mean Are all the rest come back
[SHK] Or is it some abuse and no such thing
[SHK] Know you the hand
[SHK] 'T is Hamlets character 'Naked
[SHK] And in a postscript here he says 'alone
[SHK] Can you advise me
[SHK] I 'm lost in it my lord But let him come
[SHK] It warms the very sickness in my heart
[SHK] That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
[SHK] 'Thus didest thou
[SHK] If it be so Laertes --
[SHK] As how should it be so how otherwise --
[SHK] Will you be ruled by me
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] So you will not o'errule me to a peace
[SHK] To thine own peace If he be now return 'd
[SHK] As checking at his voyage and that he means
[SHK] No more to undertake it I will work him
[SHK] To an exploit now ripe in my device
[SHK] Under the which he shall not choose but fall
[SHK] And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
[SHK] But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
[SHK] And call it accident
[SHK] My lord I will be ruled
[SHK] The rather if you could devise it so
[SHK] That I might be the organ
[SHK] It falls right
[SHK] You have been talk 'd of since your travel much
[SHK] And that in Hamlet 's hearing for a quality
[SHK] Wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
[SHK] Did not together pluck such envy from him
[SHK] As did that one and that in my regard
[SHK] Of the unworthiest siege
[SHK] What part is that my lord
[SHK] A very riband in the cap of youth
[SHK] Yet needful too for youth no less becomes
[SHK] The light and careless livery that it wears
[SHK] Than settled age his sables and his weeds
[SHK] Importing health and graveness Two months since
[SHK] Here was a gentleman of Normandy --
[SHK] I 've seen myself and served against the French
[SHK] And they can well on horseback but this gallant
[SHK] Had witchcraft i n't he grew unto his seat
[SHK] And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
[SHK] As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
[SHK] With the brave beast so far he topp 'd my thought
[SHK] That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
[SHK] Come short of what he did
[SHK] A Norman was't
[SHK] A Norman
[SHK] Upon my life Lamond
[SHK] The very same
[SHK] I know him well he is the brooch indeed
[SHK] And gem of all the nation
[SHK] He made confession of you
[SHK] And gave you such a masterly report
[SHK] For art and exercise in your defence
[SHK] And for your rapier most especially
[SHK] That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
[SHK] If one could match you the scrimers of their nation
[SHK] He swore had had neither motion guard nor eye
[SHK] If you opposed them Sir this report of his
[SHK] Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
[SHK] That he could nothing do but wish and beg
[SHK] Your sudden coming o'er to play with him
[SHK] Now out of this --
[SHK] What out of this my lord
[SHK] Laertes was your father dear to you
[SHK] Or are you like the painting of a sorrow
[SHK] A face without a heart
[SHK] Why ask you this
[SHK] Not that I think you did not love your father
[SHK] But that I know love is begun by time
[SHK] And that I see in passages of proof
[SHK] Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
[SHK] There lives within the very flame of love
[SHK] A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
[SHK] And nothing is at a like goodness still
[SHK] For goodness growing to a plurisy
[SHK] Dies in his own too much that we would do
[SHK] We should do when we would for this 'would changes
[SHK] And hath abatements and delays as many
[SHK] As there are tongues are hands are accidents
[SHK] And then this 'should is like a spendthrift sigh
[SHK] That hurts by easing But to the quick o the ulcer --
[SHK] Hamlet comes back what would you undertake
[SHK] To show yourself your father 's son in deed
[SHK] More than in words
[SHK] To cut his throat i the church
[SHK] No place indeed should murder sanctuarize
[SHK] Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes
[SHK] Will you do this keep close within your chamber
[SHK] Hamlet return 'd shall know you are come home
[SHK] We 'll put on those shall praise your excellence
[SHK] And set a double varnish on the fame
[SHK] The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
[SHK] And wager on your heads he being remiss
[SHK] Most generous and free from all contriving
[SHK] Will not peruse the foils so that with ease
[SHK] Or with a little shuffling you may choose
[SHK] A sword unbated and in a pass of practise
[SHK] Requite him for your father
[SHK] I will do't
[SHK] And for that purpose I 'll anoint my sword
[SHK] I bought an unction of a mountebank
[SHK] So mortal that but dip a knife in it
[SHK] Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
[SHK] Collected from all simples that have virtue
[SHK] Under the moon can save the thing from death
[SHK] That is but scratch 'd withal I 'll touch my point
[SHK] With this contagion that if I gall him slightly
[SHK] It may be death
[SHK] Let 's further think of this
[SHK] Weigh what convenience both of time and means
[SHK] May fit us to our shape if this should fail
[SHK] And that our drift look through our bad performance
[SHK] 'Twere better not assay 'd therefore this project
[SHK] Should have a back or second that might hold
[SHK] If this should blast in proof Soft let me see
[SHK] We 'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings I ha't
[SHK] When in your motion you are hot and dry --
[SHK] As make your bouts more violent to that end --
[SHK] And that he calls for drink I 'll have prepared him
[SHK] A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
[SHK] If he by chance escape your venom 'd stuck
[SHK] Our purpose may hold there
[SHK] How now sweet queen
[SHK] One woe doth tread upon another 's heel
[SHK] So fast they follow your sister 's drown 'd Laertes
[SHK] Drown 'd O where
[SHK] There is a willow grows aslant a brook
[SHK] That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
[SHK] There with fantastic garlands did she come
[SHK] Of crow-flowers nettles daisies and long purples
[SHK] That liberal shepherds give a grosser name
[SHK] But our cold maids do dead men 's fingers call them
[SHK] There on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
[SHK] Clambering to hang an envious sliver broke
[SHK] When down her weedy trophies and herself
[SHK] Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide
[SHK] And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up
[SHK] Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
[SHK] As one incapable of her own distress
[SHK] Or like a creature native and indued
[SHK] Unto that element but long it could not be
[SHK] Till that her garments heavy with their drink
[SHK] Pull 'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
[SHK] To muddy death
[SHK] Alas then she is drown 'd
[SHK] Drown 'd drown 'd
[SHK] Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia
[SHK] And therefore I forbid my tears but yet
[SHK] It is our trick nature her custom holds
[SHK] Let shame say what it will when these are gone
[SHK] The woman will be out Adieu my lord
[SHK] I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
[SHK] But that this folly douts it
[SHK] Let 's follow Gertrude
[SHK] How much I had to do to calm his rage
[SHK] Now fear I this will give it start again
[SHK] Therefore let 's follow
[SHK] Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
[SHK] wilfully seeks her own salvation
[SHK] I tell thee she is and therefore make her grave
[SHK] straight the crowner hath sat on her and finds it
[SHK] Christian burial
[SHK] How can that be unless she drowned herself in her
[SHK] own defence
[SHK] Why 't is found so
[SHK] It must be 'se offendendo it can not be else For
[SHK] here lies the point if I drown myself wittingly
[SHK] it argues an act and an act hath three branches it
[SHK] is to act to do to perform argal she drowned
[SHK] herself wittingly
[SHK] Nay but hear you goodman delver --
[SHK] Give me leave Here lies the water good here
[SHK] stands the man good if the man go to this water
[SHK] and drown himself it is will he nill he he
[SHK] goes -- mark you that but if the water come to him
[SHK] and drown him he drowns not himself argal he
[SHK] that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life
[SHK] But is this law
[SHK] Ay marry is't crowner 's quest law
[SHK] Will you ha the truth o n't If this had not been
[SHK] a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o
[SHK] Christian burial
[SHK] Why there thou say'st and the more pity that
[SHK] great folk should have countenance in this world to
[SHK] drown or hang themselves more than their even
[SHK] Christian Come my spade There is no ancient
[SHK] gentleman but gardeners ditchers and grave-makers
[SHK] they hold up Adam 's profession
[SHK] Was he a gentleman
[SHK] He was the first that ever bore arms
[SHK] Why he had none
[SHK] What art a heathen How dost thou understand the
[SHK] Scripture The Scripture says 'Adam digged
[SHK] could he dig without arms I 'll put another
[SHK] question to thee if thou answerest me not to the
[SHK] purpose confess thyself --
[SHK] Go to
[SHK] What is he that builds stronger than either the
[SHK] mason the shipwright or the carpenter
[SHK] The gallows-maker for that frame outlives a
[SHK] thousand tenants
[SHK] I like thy wit well in good faith the gallows
[SHK] does well but how does it well it does well to
[SHK] those that do in now thou dost ill to say the
[SHK] gallows is built stronger than the church argal
[SHK] the gallows may do well to thee To't again come
[SHK] 'Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or
[SHK] a carpenter
[SHK] Ay tell me that and unyoke
[SHK] Marry now I can tell
[SHK] To't
[SHK] Mass I can not tell
[SHK] Cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull
[SHK] ass will not mend his pace with beating and when
[SHK] you are asked this question next say a
[SHK] grave-maker 'the houses that he makes last till
[SHK] doomsday Go get thee to Yaughan fetch me a
[SHK] stoup of liquor
[SHK] In youth when I did love did love
[SHK] Methought it was very sweet
[SHK] To contract O the time for ah my behove
[SHK] O methought there was nothing meet
[SHK] Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he
[SHK] sings at grave-making
[SHK] Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
[SHK] 'T is e'en so the hand of little employment hath
[SHK] the daintier sense
[SHK] But age with his stealing steps
[SHK] Hath claw 'd me in his clutch
[SHK] And hath shipped me intil the land
[SHK] As if I had never been such
[SHK] That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
[SHK] how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were
[SHK] Cain 's jaw-bone that did the first murder It
[SHK] might be the pate of a politician which this ass
[SHK] now o'er-reaches one that would circumvent God
[SHK] might it not
[SHK] It might my lord
[SHK] Or of a courtier which could say 'Good morrow
[SHK] sweet lord How dost thou good lord This might
[SHK] be my lord such-a-one that praised my lord
[SHK] such-a-one 's horse when he meant to beg it might it not
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] Why e'en so and now my Lady Worm 's chapless and
[SHK] knocked about the mazzard with a sexton 's spade
[SHK] here 's fine revolution an we had the trick to
[SHK] see't Did these bones cost no more the breeding
[SHK] but to play at loggats with 'em mine ache to think o n't
[SHK] A pick-axe and a spade a spade
[SHK] For and a shrouding sheet
[SHK] O a pit of clay for to be made
[SHK] For such a guest is meet
[SHK] There 's another why may not that be the skull of a
[SHK] lawyer Where be his quiddities now his quillets
[SHK] his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he
[SHK] suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
[SHK] sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of
[SHK] his action of battery Hum This fellow might be
[SHK] in 's time a great buyer of land with his statutes
[SHK] his recognizances his fines his double vouchers
[SHK] his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and
[SHK] the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
[SHK] pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him
[SHK] no more of his purchases and double ones too than
[SHK] the length and breadth of a pair of indentures The
[SHK] very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
[SHK] this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha
[SHK] Not a jot more my lord
[SHK] Is not parchment made of sheepskins
[SHK] Ay my lord and of calf-skins too
[SHK] They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
[SHK] in that I will speak to this fellow Whose
[SHK] grave 's this sirrah
[SHK] Mine sir
[SHK] O a pit of clay for to be made
[SHK] For such a guest is meet
[SHK] I think it be thine indeed for thou liest i n't
[SHK] You lie out o n't sir and therefore it is not
[SHK] yours for my part I do not lie i n't and yet it is mine
[SHK] 'Thou dost lie i n't to be i n't and say it is thine
[SHK] 't is for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest
[SHK] 'T is a quick lie sir 'twill away gain from me to
[SHK] you
[SHK] What man dost thou dig it for
[SHK] For no man sir
[SHK] What woman then
[SHK] For none neither
[SHK] Who is to be buried i n't
[SHK] One that was a woman sir but rest her soul she 's dead
[SHK] How absolute the knave is we must speak by the
[SHK] card or equivocation will undo us By the Lord
[SHK] Horatio these three years I have taken a note of
[SHK] it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
[SHK] peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
[SHK] gaffs his kibe How long hast thou been a
[SHK] grave-maker
[SHK] Of all the days i the year I came to't that day
[SHK] that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
[SHK] How long is that since
[SHK] Can not you tell that every fool can tell that it
[SHK] was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that
[SHK] is mad and sent into England
[SHK] Ay marry why was he sent into England
[SHK] Why because he was mad he shall recover his wits
[SHK] there or if he do not it 's no great matter there
[SHK] Why
[SHK] 'Twill a not be seen in him there there the men
[SHK] are as mad as he
[SHK] How came he mad
[SHK] Very strangely they say
[SHK] How strangely
[SHK] Faith e'en with losing his wits
[SHK] Upon what ground
[SHK] Why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man
[SHK] and boy thirty years
[SHK] How long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot
[SHK] I faith if he be not rotten before he die -- as we
[SHK] have many pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce
[SHK] hold the laying in -- he will last you some eight year
[SHK] or nine year a tanner will last you nine year
[SHK] Why he more than another
[SHK] Why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that
[SHK] he will keep out water a great while and your water
[SHK] is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
[SHK] Here 's a skull now this skull has lain in the earth
[SHK] three and twenty years
[SHK] Whose was it
[SHK] A whoreson mad fellow 's it was whose do you think it was
[SHK] Nay I know not
[SHK] A pestilence on him for a mad rogue a poured a
[SHK] flagon of Rhenish on my head once This same skull
[SHK] sir was Yorick 's skull the king 's jester
[SHK] This
[SHK] E'en that
[SHK] Let me see
[SHK] Alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow
[SHK] of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath
[SHK] borne me on his back a thousand times and now how
[SHK] abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rims at
[SHK] it Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
[SHK] not how oft Where be your gibes now your
[SHK] gambols your songs your flashes of merriment
[SHK] that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one
[SHK] now to mock your own grinning quite chap-fallen
[SHK] Now get you to my lady 's chamber and tell her let
[SHK] her paint an inch thick to this favour she must
[SHK] come make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio tell
[SHK] me one thing
[SHK] What 's that my lord
[SHK] Dost thou think Alexander looked o this fashion i
[SHK] the earth
[SHK] E'en so
[SHK] And smelt so pah
[SHK] E'en so my lord
[SHK] To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may
[SHK] not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander
[SHK] till he find it stopping a bung-hole
[SHK] 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so
[SHK] No faith not a jot but to follow him thither with
[SHK] modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as
[SHK] thus Alexander died Alexander was buried
[SHK] Alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of
[SHK] earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
[SHK] was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel
[SHK] Imperious Caesar dead and turn 'd to clay
[SHK] Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
[SHK] O that that earth which kept the world in awe
[SHK] Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw
[SHK] But soft but soft aside here comes the king
[SHK] The queen the courtiers who is this they follow
[SHK] And with such maimed rites This doth betoken
[SHK] The corse they follow did with desperate hand
[SHK] Fordo its own life 't was of some estate
[SHK] Couch we awhile and mark
[SHK] What ceremony else
[SHK] That is Laertes
[SHK] A very noble youth mark
[SHK] What ceremony else
[SHK] Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
[SHK] As we have warrantise her death was doubtful
[SHK] And but that great command o'ersways the order
[SHK] She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
[SHK] Till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
[SHK] Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
[SHK] Yet here she is allow 'd her virgin crants
[SHK] Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
[SHK] Of bell and burial
[SHK] Must there no more be done
[SHK] No more be done
[SHK] We should profane the service of the dead
[SHK] To sing a requiem and such rest to her
[SHK] As to peace-parted souls
[SHK] Lay her i the earth
[SHK] And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
[SHK] May violets spring I tell thee churlish priest
[SHK] A ministering angel shall my sister be
[SHK] When thou liest howling
[SHK] What the fair Ophelia
[SHK] Sweets to the sweet farewell
[SHK] I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet 's wife
[SHK] I thought thy bride-bed to have deck 'd sweet maid
[SHK] And not have strew 'd thy grave
[SHK] O treble woe
[SHK] Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
[SHK] Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
[SHK] Deprived thee of Hold off the earth awhile
[SHK] Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
[SHK] Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
[SHK] Till of this flat a mountain you have made
[SHK] To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
[SHK] Of blue Olympus
[SHK] Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
[SHK] Conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
[SHK] Like wonder-wounded hearers This is I
[SHK] Hamlet the Dane
[SHK] The devil take thy soul
[SHK] Thou pray'st not well
[SHK] I prithee take thy fingers from my throat
[SHK] For though I am not splenitive and rash
[SHK] Yet have I something in me dangerous
[SHK] Which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand
[SHK] Pluck them asunder
[SHK] Hamlet Hamlet
[SHK] Gentlemen --
[SHK] Good my lord be quiet
[SHK] Why I will fight with him upon this theme
[SHK] Until my eyelids will no longer wag
[SHK] O my son what theme
[SHK] I loved Ophelia forty thousand brothers
[SHK] Could not with all their quantity of love
[SHK] Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her
[SHK] O he is mad Laertes
[SHK] For love of God forbear him
[SHK] 'Swounds show me what thou'lt do
[SHK] Woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself
[SHK] Woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile
[SHK] I 'll do't Dost thou come here to whine
[SHK] To outface me with leaping in her grave
[SHK] Be buried quick with her and so will I
[SHK] And if thou prate of mountains let them throw
[SHK] Millions of acres on us till our ground
[SHK] Singeing his pate against the burning zone
[SHK] Make Ossa like a wart Nay an thou'lt mouth
[SHK] I 'll rant as well as thou
[SHK] This is mere madness
[SHK] And thus awhile the fit will work on him
[SHK] Anon as patient as the female dove
[SHK] When that her golden couplets are disclosed
[SHK] His silence will sit drooping
[SHK] Hear you sir
[SHK] What is the reason that you use me thus
[SHK] I loved you ever but it is no matter
[SHK] Let Hercules himself do what he may
[SHK] The cat will mew and dog will have his day
[SHK] I pray you good Horatio wait upon him
[SHK] Strengthen your patience in our last night 's speech
[SHK] We 'll put the matter to the present push
[SHK] Good Gertrude set some watch over your son
[SHK] This grave shall have a living monument
[SHK] An hour of quiet shortly shall we see
[SHK] Till then in patience our proceeding be
[SHK] So much for this sir now shall you see the other
[SHK] You do remember all the circumstance
[SHK] Remember it my lord
[SHK] Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
[SHK] That would not let me sleep methought I lay
[SHK] Worse than the mutines in the bilboes Rashly
[SHK] And praised be rashness for it let us know
[SHK] Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
[SHK] When our deep plots do pall and that should teach us
[SHK] There 's a divinity that shapes our ends
[SHK] Rough-hew them how we will --
[SHK] That is most certain
[SHK] Up from my cabin
[SHK] My sea-gown scarf 'd about me in the dark
[SHK] Groped I to find out them had my desire
[SHK] Finger 'd their packet and in fine withdrew
[SHK] To mine own room again making so bold
[SHK] My fears forgetting manners to unseal
[SHK] Their grand commission where I found Horatio --
[SHK] O royal knavery -- an exact command
[SHK] Larded with many several sorts of reasons
[SHK] Importing Denmark 's health and England 's too
[SHK] With ho such bugs and goblins in my life
[SHK] That on the supervise no leisure bated
[SHK] No not to stay the grinding of the axe
[SHK] My head should be struck off
[SHK] Is't possible
[SHK] Here 's the commission read it at more leisure
[SHK] But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed
[SHK] I beseech you
[SHK] Being thus be-netted round with villanies --
[SHK] Ere I could make a prologue to my brains
[SHK] They had begun the play -- I sat me down
[SHK] Devised a new commission wrote it fair
[SHK] I once did hold it as our statists do
[SHK] A baseness to write fair and labour 'd much
[SHK] How to forget that learning but sir now
[SHK] It did me yeoman 's service wilt thou know
[SHK] The effect of what I wrote
[SHK] Ay good my lord
[SHK] An earnest conjuration from the king
[SHK] As England was his faithful tributary
[SHK] As love between them like the palm might flourish
[SHK] As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
[SHK] And stand a comma 'tween their amities
[SHK] And many such-like 'As'es of great charge
[SHK] That on the view and knowing of these contents
[SHK] Without debatement further more or less
[SHK] He should the bearers put to sudden death
[SHK] Not shriving-time allow 'd
[SHK] How was this seal 'd
[SHK] Why even in that was heaven ordinant
[SHK] I had my father 's signet in my purse
[SHK] Which was the model of that Danish seal
[SHK] Folded the writ up in form of the other
[SHK] Subscribed it gave't the impression placed it safely
[SHK] The changeling never known Now the next day
[SHK] Was our sea-fight and what to this was sequent
[SHK] Thou know'st already
[SHK] So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't
[SHK] Why man they did make love to this employment
[SHK] They are not near my conscience their defeat
[SHK] Does by their own insinuation grow
[SHK] 'T is dangerous when the baser nature comes
[SHK] Between the pass and fell incensed points
[SHK] Of mighty opposites
[SHK] Why what a king is this
[SHK] Does it not think'st thee stand me now upon --
[SHK] He that hath kill 'd my king and whored my mother
[SHK] Popp 'd in between the election and my hopes
[SHK] Thrown out his angle for my proper life
[SHK] And with such cozenage -- is't not perfect conscience
[SHK] To quit him with this arm and is't not to be damn 'd
[SHK] To let this canker of our nature come
[SHK] In further evil
[SHK] It must be shortly known to him from England
[SHK] What is the issue of the business there
[SHK] It will be short the interim is mine
[SHK] And a man 's life 's no more than to say 'One
[SHK] But I am very sorry good Horatio
[SHK] That to Laertes I forgot myself
[SHK] For by the image of my cause I see
[SHK] The portraiture of his I 'll court his favours
[SHK] But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
[SHK] Into a towering passion
[SHK] Peace who comes here
[SHK] Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
[SHK] I humbly thank you sir Dost know this water-fly
[SHK] No my good lord
[SHK] Thy state is the more gracious for 't is a vice to
[SHK] know him He hath much land and fertile let a
[SHK] beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at
[SHK] the king 's mess 't is a chough but as I say
[SHK] spacious in the possession of dirt
[SHK] Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I
[SHK] should impart a thing to you from his majesty
[SHK] I will receive it sir with all diligence of
[SHK] spirit Put your bonnet to his right use 't is for the head
[SHK] I thank your lordship it is very hot
[SHK] No believe me 't is very cold the wind is
[SHK] northerly
[SHK] It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
[SHK] But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
[SHK] complexion
[SHK] Exceedingly my lord it is very sultry -- as
[SHK] 'twere -- I can not tell how But my lord his
[SHK] majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
[SHK] great wager on your head sir this is the matter --
[SHK] I beseech you remember --
[SHK] Nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
[SHK] Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe
[SHK] me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent
[SHK] differences of very soft society and great showing
[SHK] indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or
[SHK] calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the
[SHK] continent of what part a gentleman would see
[SHK] Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you
[SHK] though I know to divide him inventorially would
[SHK] dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw
[SHK] neither in respect of his quick sail But in the
[SHK] verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of
[SHK] great article and his infusion of such dearth and
[SHK] rareness as to make true diction of him his
[SHK] semblable is his mirror and who else would trace
[SHK] him his umbrage nothing more
[SHK] Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
[SHK] The concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman
[SHK] in our more rawer breath
[SHK] Sir
[SHK] Is't not possible to understand in another tongue
[SHK] You will do't sir really
[SHK] What imports the nomination of this gentleman
[SHK] Of Laertes
[SHK] His purse is empty already all 's golden words are spent
[SHK] Of him sir
[SHK] I know you are not ignorant --
[SHK] I would you did sir yet in faith if you did
[SHK] it would not much approve me Well sir
[SHK] You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is --
[SHK] I dare not confess that lest I should compare with
[SHK] him in excellence but to know a man well were to
[SHK] know himself
[SHK] I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation
[SHK] laid on him by them in his meed he 's unfellowed
[SHK] What 's his weapon
[SHK] Rapier and dagger
[SHK] That 's two of his weapons but well
[SHK] The king sir hath wagered with him six Barbary
[SHK] horses against the which he has imponed as I take
[SHK] it six French rapiers and poniards with their
[SHK] assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the
[SHK] carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very
[SHK] responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages
[SHK] and of very liberal conceit
[SHK] What call you the carriages
[SHK] I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done
[SHK] The carriages sir are the hangers
[SHK] The phrase would be more german to the matter if we
[SHK] could carry cannon by our sides I would it might
[SHK] be hangers till then But on six Barbary horses
[SHK] against six French swords their assigns and three
[SHK] liberal-conceited carriages that 's the French bet
[SHK] against the Danish Why is this 'imponed as you call it
[SHK] The king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes
[SHK] between yourself and him he shall not exceed you
[SHK] three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it
[SHK] would come to immediate trial if your lordship
[SHK] would vouchsafe the answer
[SHK] How if I answer 'no
[SHK] I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
[SHK] Sir I will walk here in the hall if it please his
[SHK] majesty 't is the breathing time of day with me let
[SHK] the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the
[SHK] king hold his purpose I will win for him an I can
[SHK] if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
[SHK] Shall I re-deliver you e'en so
[SHK] To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
[SHK] I commend my duty to your lordship
[SHK] Yours yours
[SHK] He does well to commend it himself there are no
[SHK] tongues else for 's turn
[SHK] This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
[SHK] He did comply with his dug before he sucked it
[SHK] Thus has he -- and many more of the same bevy that I
[SHK] know the dressy age dotes on -- only got the tune of
[SHK] the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of
[SHK] yesty collection which carries them through and
[SHK] through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do
[SHK] but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
[SHK] My lord his majesty commended him to you by young
[SHK] Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in
[SHK] the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
[SHK] play with Laertes or that you will take longer time
[SHK] I am constant to my purpose they follow the king 's
[SHK] pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now
[SHK] or whensoever provided I be so able as now
[SHK] The king and queen and all are coming down
[SHK] In happy time
[SHK] The queen desires you to use some gentle
[SHK] entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play
[SHK] She well instructs me
[SHK] You will lose this wager my lord
[SHK] I do not think so since he went into France I
[SHK] have been in continual practise I shall win at the
[SHK] odds But thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here
[SHK] about my heart but it is no matter
[SHK] Nay good my lord --
[SHK] It is but foolery but it is such a kind of
[SHK] gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman
[SHK] If your mind dislike any thing obey it I will
[SHK] forestall their repair hither and say you are not
[SHK] fit
[SHK] Not a whit we defy augury there 's a special
[SHK] providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be now
[SHK] 't is not to come if it be not to come it will be
[SHK] now if it be not now yet it will come the
[SHK] readiness is all since no man has aught of what he
[SHK] leaves what is't to leave betimes
[SHK] Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
[SHK] Give me your pardon sir I 've done you wrong
[SHK] But pardo n't as you are a gentleman
[SHK] This presence knows
[SHK] And you must needs have heard how I am punish 'd
[SHK] With sore distraction What I have done
[SHK] That might your nature honour and exception
[SHK] Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness
[SHK] Was't Hamlet wrong 'd Laertes Never Hamlet
[SHK] If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away
[SHK] And when he 's not himself does wrong Laertes
[SHK] Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it
[SHK] Who does it then His madness if't be so
[SHK] Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong 'd
[SHK] His madness is poor Hamlet 's enemy
[SHK] Sir in this audience
[SHK] Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
[SHK] Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
[SHK] That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house
[SHK] And hurt my brother
[SHK] I am satisfied in nature
[SHK] Whose motive in this case should stir me most
[SHK] To my revenge but in my terms of honour
[SHK] I stand aloof and will no reconcilement
[SHK] Till by some elder masters of known honour
[SHK] I have a voice and precedent of peace
[SHK] To keep my name ungored But till that time
[SHK] I do receive your offer 'd love like love
[SHK] And will not wrong it
[SHK] I embrace it freely
[SHK] And will this brother 's wager frankly play
[SHK] Give us the foils Come on
[SHK] Come one for me
[SHK] I 'll be your foil Laertes in mine ignorance
[SHK] Your skill shall like a star i the darkest night
[SHK] Stick fiery off indeed
[SHK] You mock me sir
[SHK] No by this hand
[SHK] Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet
[SHK] You know the wager
[SHK] Very well my lord
[SHK] Your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side
[SHK] I do not fear it I have seen you both
[SHK] But since he is better 'd we have therefore odds
[SHK] This is too heavy let me see another
[SHK] This likes me well These foils have all a length
[SHK] Ay my good lord
[SHK] Set me the stoops of wine upon that table
[SHK] If Hamlet give the first or second hit
[SHK] Or quit in answer of the third exchange
[SHK] Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
[SHK] The king shall drink to Hamlet 's better breath
[SHK] And in the cup an union shall he throw
[SHK] Richer than that which four successive kings
[SHK] In Denmark 's crown have worn Give me the cups
[SHK] And let the kettle to the trumpet speak
[SHK] The trumpet to the cannoneer without
[SHK] The cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth
[SHK] 'Now the king dunks to Hamlet Come begin
[SHK] And you the judges bear a wary eye
[SHK] Come on sir
[SHK] Come my lord
[SHK] One
[SHK] No
[SHK] Judgment
[SHK] A hit a very palpable hit
[SHK] Well again
[SHK] Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine
[SHK] Here 's to thy health
[SHK] Give him the cup
[SHK] I 'll play this bout first set it by awhile Come
[SHK] Another hit what say you
[SHK] A touch a touch I do confess
[SHK] Our son shall win
[SHK] He 's fat and scant of breath
[SHK] Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
[SHK] The queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet
[SHK] Good madam
[SHK] Gertrude do not drink
[SHK] I will my lord I pray you pardon me
[SHK] I dare not drink yet madam by and by
[SHK] Come let me wipe thy face
[SHK] My lord I 'll hit him now
[SHK] I do not think't
[SHK] Come for the third Laertes you but dally
[SHK] I pray you pass with your best violence
[SHK] I am afeard you make a wanton of me
[SHK] Say you so come on
[SHK] Nothing neither way
[SHK] Have at you now
[SHK] Part them they are incensed
[SHK] Nay come again
[SHK] Look to the queen there ho
[SHK] They bleed on both sides How is it my lord
[SHK] How is't Laertes
[SHK] Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric
[SHK] I am justly kill 'd with mine own treachery
[SHK] How does the queen
[SHK] She swounds to see them bleed
[SHK] No no the drink the drink -- O my dear Hamlet --
[SHK] The drink the drink I am poison 'd
[SHK] O villany Ho let the door be lock 'd
[SHK] Treachery Seek it out
[SHK] It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain
[SHK] No medicine in the world can do thee good
[SHK] In thee there is not half an hour of life
[SHK] The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
[SHK] Unbated and envenom 'd the foul practise
[SHK] Hath turn 'd itself on me lo here I lie
[SHK] Never to rise again thy mother 's poison 'd
[SHK] I can no more the king the king 's to blame
[SHK] The point -- envenom 'd too
[SHK] Then venom to thy work
[SHK] Treason treason
[SHK] O yet defend me friends I am but hurt
[SHK] Here thou incestuous murderous damned Dane
[SHK] Drink off this potion Is thy union here
[SHK] Follow my mother
[SHK] He is justly served
[SHK] It is a poison temper 'd by himself
[SHK] Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
[SHK] Mine and my father 's death come not upon thee
[SHK] Nor thine on me
[SHK] Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee
[SHK] I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu
[SHK] You that look pale and tremble at this chance
[SHK] That are but mutes or audience to this act
[SHK] Had I but time -- as this fell sergeant death
[SHK] Is strict in his arrest -- O I could tell you --
[SHK] But let it be Horatio I am dead
[SHK] Thou livest report me and my cause aright
[SHK] To the unsatisfied
[SHK] Never believe it
[SHK] I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
[SHK] Here 's yet some liquor left
[SHK] As thou'rt a man
[SHK] Give me the cup let go by heaven I 'll have't
[SHK] O good Horatio what a wounded name
[SHK] Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
[SHK] If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
[SHK] Absent thee from felicity awhile
[SHK] And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
[SHK] To tell my story
[SHK] What warlike noise is this
[SHK] Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland
[SHK] To the ambassadors of England gives
[SHK] This warlike volley
[SHK] O I die Horatio
[SHK] The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit
[SHK] I can not live to hear the news from England
[SHK] But I do prophesy the election lights
[SHK] On Fortinbras he has my dying voice
[SHK] So tell him with the occurrents more and less
[SHK] Which have solicited The rest is silence
[SHK] Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince
[SHK] And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
[SHK] Why does the drum come hither
[SHK] Where is this sight
[SHK] What is it ye would see
[SHK] If aught of woe or wonder cease your search
[SHK] This quarry cries on havoc O proud death
[SHK] What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
[SHK] That thou so many princes at a shot
[SHK] So bloodily hast struck
[SHK] The sight is dismal
[SHK] And our affairs from England come too late
[SHK] The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
[SHK] To tell him his commandment is fulfill 'd
[SHK] That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
[SHK] Where should we have our thanks
[SHK] Not from his mouth
[SHK] Had it the ability of life to thank you
[SHK] He never gave commandment for their death
[SHK] But since so jump upon this bloody question
[SHK] You from the Polack wars and you from England
[SHK] Are here arrived give order that these bodies
[SHK] High on a stage be placed to the view
[SHK] And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
[SHK] How these things came about so shall you hear
[SHK] Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
[SHK] Of accidental judgments casual slaughters
[SHK] Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
[SHK] And in this upshot purposes mistook
[SHK] Fall'n on the inventors reads all this can I
[SHK] Truly deliver
[SHK] Let us haste to hear it
[SHK] And call the noblest to the audience
[SHK] For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
[SHK] I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
[SHK] Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
[SHK] Of that I shall have also cause to speak
[SHK] And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
[SHK] But let this same be presently perform 'd
[SHK] Even while men 's minds are wild lest more mischance
[SHK] On plots and errors happen
[SHK] Let four captains
[SHK] Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
[SHK] For he was likely had he been put on
[SHK] To have proved most royally and for his passage
[SHK] The soldiers music and the rites of war
[SHK] Speak loudly for him
[SHK] Take up the bodies such a sight as this
[SHK] Becomes the field but here shows much amiss
[SHK] Go bid the soldiers shoot
[SHK] Hence home you idle creatures get you home
[SHK] Is this a holiday what know you not
[SHK] Being mechanical you ought not walk
[SHK] Upon a labouring day without the sign
[SHK] Of your profession Speak what trade art thou
[SHK] Why sir a carpenter
[SHK] Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
[SHK] What dost thou with thy best apparel on
[SHK] You sir what trade are you
[SHK] Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but
[SHK] as you would say a cobbler
[SHK] But what trade art thou answer me directly
[SHK] A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe
[SHK] conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
[SHK] What trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade
[SHK] Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet
[SHK] if you be out sir I can mend you
[SHK] What meanest thou by that mend me thou saucy fellow
[SHK] Why sir cobble you
[SHK] Thou art a cobbler art thou
[SHK] Truly sir all that I live by is with the awl I
[SHK] meddle with no tradesman 's matters nor women 's
[SHK] matters but with awl I am indeed sir a surgeon
[SHK] to old shoes when they are in great danger I
[SHK] recover them As proper men as ever trod upon
[SHK] neat 's leather have gone upon my handiwork
[SHK] But wherefore art not in thy shop today
[SHK] Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
[SHK] Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
[SHK] into more work But indeed sir we make holiday
[SHK] to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
[SHK] Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
[SHK] What tributaries follow him to Rome
[SHK] To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels
[SHK] You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
[SHK] O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
[SHK] Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
[SHK] Have you climb 'd up to walls and battlements
[SHK] To towers and windows yea to chimney-tops
[SHK] Your infants in your arms and there have sat
[SHK] The livelong day with patient expectation
[SHK] To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
[SHK] And when you saw his chariot but appear
[SHK] Have you not made an universal shout
[SHK] That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
[SHK] To hear the replication of your sounds
[SHK] Made in her concave shores
[SHK] And do you now put on your best attire
[SHK] And do you now cull out a holiday
[SHK] And do you now strew flowers in his way
[SHK] That comes in triumph over Pompey 's blood Be gone
[SHK] Run to your houses fall upon your knees
[SHK] Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
[SHK] That needs must light on this ingratitude
[SHK] Go go good countrymen and for this fault
[SHK] Assemble all the poor men of your sort
[SHK] Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
[SHK] Into the channel till the lowest stream
[SHK] Do kiss the most exalted shores of all
[SHK] See whether their basest metal be not moved
[SHK] They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness
[SHK] Go you down that way towards the Capitol
[SHK] This way will I disrobe the images
[SHK] If you do find them deck 'd with ceremonies
[SHK] May we do so
[SHK] You know it is the feast of Lupercal
[SHK] It is no matter let no images
[SHK] Be hung with Caesar 's trophies I 'll about
[SHK] And drive away the vulgar from the streets
[SHK] So do you too where you perceive them thick
[SHK] These growing feathers pluck 'd from Caesar 's wing
[SHK] Will make him fly an ordinary pitch
[SHK] Who else would soar above the view of men
[SHK] And keep us all in servile fearfulness
[SHK] Calpurnia
[SHK] Peace ho Caesar speaks
[SHK] Calpurnia
[SHK] Here my lord
[SHK] Stand you directly in Antonius way
[SHK] When he doth run his course Antonius
[SHK] Caesar my lord
[SHK] Forget not in your speed Antonius
[SHK] To touch Calpurnia for our elders say
[SHK] The barren touched in this holy chase
[SHK] Shake off their sterile curse
[SHK] I shall remember
[SHK] When Caesar says 'do this it is perform 'd
[SHK] Set on and leave no ceremony out
[SHK] Caesar
[SHK] Ha who calls
[SHK] Bid every noise be still peace yet again
[SHK] Who is it in the press that calls on me
[SHK] I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
[SHK] Cry 'Caesar Speak Caesar is turn 'd to hear
[SHK] Beware the ides of March
[SHK] What man is that
[SHK] A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March
[SHK] Set him before me let me see his face
[SHK] Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar
[SHK] What say'st thou to me now speak once again
[SHK] Beware the ides of March
[SHK] He is a dreamer let us leave him pass
[SHK] Will you go see the order of the course
[SHK] Not I
[SHK] I pray you do
[SHK] I am not gamesome I do lack some part
[SHK] Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
[SHK] Let me not hinder Cassius your desires
[SHK] I 'll leave you
[SHK] Brutus I do observe you now of late
[SHK] I have not from your eyes that gentleness
[SHK] And show of love as I was wont to have
[SHK] You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
[SHK] Over your friend that loves you
[SHK] Cassius
[SHK] Be not deceived if I have veil 'd my look
[SHK] I turn the trouble of my countenance
[SHK] Merely upon myself Vexed I am
[SHK] Of late with passions of some difference
[SHK] Conceptions only proper to myself
[SHK] Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
[SHK] But let not therefore my good friends be grieved --
[SHK] Among which number Cassius be you one --
[SHK] Nor construe any further my neglect
[SHK] Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
[SHK] Forgets the shows of love to other men
[SHK] Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion
[SHK] By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
[SHK] Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
[SHK] Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
[SHK] No Cassius for the eye sees not itself
[SHK] But by reflection by some other things
[SHK] 'T is just
[SHK] And it is very much lamented Brutus
[SHK] That you have no such mirrors as will turn
[SHK] Your hidden worthiness into your eye
[SHK] That you might see your shadow I have heard
[SHK] Where many of the best respect in Rome
[SHK] Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus
[SHK] And groaning underneath this age 's yoke
[SHK] Have wish 'd that noble Brutus had his eyes
[SHK] Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius
[SHK] That you would have me seek into myself
[SHK] For that which is not in me
[SHK] Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
[SHK] And since you know you can not see yourself
[SHK] So well as by reflection I your glass
[SHK] Will modestly discover to yourself
[SHK] That of yourself which you yet know not of
[SHK] And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
[SHK] Were I a common laugher or did use
[SHK] To stale with ordinary oaths my love
[SHK] To every new protester if you know
[SHK] That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
[SHK] And after scandal them or if you know
[SHK] That I profess myself in banqueting
[SHK] To all the rout then hold me dangerous
[SHK] What means this shouting I do fear the people
[SHK] Choose Caesar for their king
[SHK] Ay do you fear it
[SHK] Then must I think you would not have it so
[SHK] I would not Cassius yet I love him well
[SHK] But wherefore do you hold me here so long
[SHK] What is it that you would impart to me
[SHK] If it be aught toward the general good
[SHK] Set honour in one eye and death i the other
[SHK] And I will look on both indifferently
[SHK] For let the gods so speed me as I love
[SHK] The name of honour more than I fear death
[SHK] I know that virtue to be in you Brutus
[SHK] As well as I do know your outward favour
[SHK] Well honour is the subject of my story
[SHK] I can not tell what you and other men
[SHK] Think of this life but for my single self
[SHK] I had as lief not be as live to be
[SHK] In awe of such a thing as I myself
[SHK] I was born free as Caesar so were you
[SHK] We both have fed as well and we can both
[SHK] Endure the winter 's cold as well as he
[SHK] For once upon a raw and gusty day
[SHK] The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
[SHK] Caesar said to me 'Darest thou Cassius now
[SHK] Leap in with me into this angry flood
[SHK] And swim to yonder point Upon the word
[SHK] Accoutred as I was I plunged in
[SHK] And bade him follow so indeed he did
[SHK] The torrent roar 'd and we did buffet it
[SHK] With lusty sinews throwing it aside
[SHK] And stemming it with hearts of controversy
[SHK] But ere we could arrive the point proposed
[SHK] Caesar cried 'Help me Cassius or I sink
[SHK] I as Aeneas our great ancestor
[SHK] Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
[SHK] The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
[SHK] Did I the tired Caesar And this man
[SHK] Is now become a god and Cassius is
[SHK] A wretched creature and must bend his body
[SHK] If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
[SHK] He had a fever when he was in Spain
[SHK] And when the fit was on him I did mark
[SHK] How he did shake 't is true this god did shake
[SHK] His coward lips did from their colour fly
[SHK] And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
[SHK] Did lose his lustre I did hear him groan
[SHK] Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
[SHK] Mark him and write his speeches in their books
[SHK] Alas it cried 'Give me some drink Titinius
[SHK] As a sick girl Ye gods it doth amaze me
[SHK] A man of such a feeble temper should
[SHK] So get the start of the majestic world
[SHK] And bear the palm alone
[SHK] Another general shout
[SHK] I do believe that these applauses are
[SHK] For some new honours that are heap 'd on Caesar
[SHK] Why man he doth bestride the narrow world
[SHK] Like a Colossus and we petty men
[SHK] Walk under his huge legs and peep about
[SHK] To find ourselves dishonourable graves
[SHK] Men at some time are masters of their fates
[SHK] The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
[SHK] But in ourselves that we are underlings
[SHK] Brutus and Caesar what should be in that 'Caesar
[SHK] Why should that name be sounded more than yours
[SHK] Write them together yours is as fair a name
[SHK] Sound them it doth become the mouth as well
[SHK] Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em
[SHK] Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar
[SHK] Now in the names of all the gods at once
[SHK] Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
[SHK] That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed
[SHK] Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
[SHK] When went there by an age since the great flood
[SHK] But it was famed with more than with one man
[SHK] When could they say till now that talk 'd of Rome
[SHK] That her wide walls encompass 'd but one man
[SHK] Now is it Rome indeed and room enough
[SHK] When there is in it but one only man
[SHK] O you and I have heard our fathers say
[SHK] There was a Brutus once that would have brook 'd
[SHK] The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
[SHK] As easily as a king
[SHK] That you do love me I am nothing jealous
[SHK] What you would work me to I have some aim
[SHK] How I have thought of this and of these times
[SHK] I shall recount hereafter for this present
[SHK] I would not so with love I might entreat you
[SHK] Be any further moved What you have said
[SHK] I will consider what you have to say
[SHK] I will with patience hear and find a time
[SHK] Both meet to hear and answer such high things
[SHK] Till then my noble friend chew upon this
[SHK] Brutus had rather be a villager
[SHK] Than to repute himself a son of Rome
[SHK] Under these hard conditions as this time
[SHK] Is like to lay upon us
[SHK] I am glad that my weak words
[SHK] Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus
[SHK] The games are done and Caesar is returning
[SHK] As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
[SHK] And he will after his sour fashion tell you
[SHK] What hath proceeded worthy note to-day
[SHK] I will do so But look you Cassius
[SHK] The angry spot doth glow on Caesar 's brow
[SHK] And all the rest look like a chidden train
[SHK] Calpurnia 's cheek is pale and Cicero
[SHK] Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
[SHK] As we have seen him in the Capitol
[SHK] Being cross 'd in conference by some senators
[SHK] Casca will tell us what the matter is
[SHK] Antonius
[SHK] Caesar
[SHK] Let me have men about me that are fat
[SHK] Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o nights
[SHK] Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
[SHK] He thinks too much such men are dangerous
[SHK] Fear him not Caesar he 's not dangerous
[SHK] He is a noble Roman and well given
[SHK] Would he were fatter But I fear him not
[SHK] Yet if my name were liable to fear
[SHK] I do not know the man I should avoid
[SHK] So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
[SHK] He is a great observer and he looks
[SHK] Quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
[SHK] As thou dost Antony he hears no music
[SHK] Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
[SHK] As if he mock 'd himself and scorn 'd his spirit
[SHK] That could be moved to smile at any thing
[SHK] Such men as he be never at heart 's ease
[SHK] Whiles they behold a greater than themselves
[SHK] And therefore are they very dangerous
[SHK] I rather tell thee what is to be fear 'd
[SHK] Than what I fear for always I am Caesar
[SHK] Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
[SHK] And tell me truly what thou think'st of him
[SHK] You pull 'd me by the cloak would you speak with me
[SHK] Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced to-day
[SHK] That Caesar looks so sad
[SHK] Why you were with him were you not
[SHK] I should not then ask Casca what had chanced
[SHK] Why there was a crown offered him and being
[SHK] offered him he put it by with the back of his hand
[SHK] thus and then the people fell a-shouting
[SHK] What was the second noise for
[SHK] Why for that too
[SHK] They shouted thrice what was the last cry for
[SHK] Why for that too
[SHK] Was the crown offered him thrice
[SHK] Ay marry was't and he put it by thrice every
[SHK] time gentler than other and at every putting-by
[SHK] mine honest neighbours shouted
[SHK] Who offered him the crown
[SHK] Why Antony
[SHK] Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca
[SHK] I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it
[SHK] it was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark
[SHK] Antony offer him a crown -- yet 't was not a crown
[SHK] neither 't was one of these coronets -- and as I told
[SHK] you he put it by once but for all that to my
[SHK] thinking he would fain have had it Then he
[SHK] offered it to him again then he put it by again
[SHK] but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his
[SHK] fingers off it And then he offered it the third
[SHK] time he put it the third time by and still as he
[SHK] refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their
[SHK] chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
[SHK] and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
[SHK] Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
[SHK] Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and
[SHK] for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of
[SHK] opening my lips and receiving the bad air
[SHK] But soft I pray you what did Caesar swound
[SHK] He fell down in the market-place and foamed at
[SHK] mouth and was speechless
[SHK] 'T is very like he hath the failing sickness
[SHK] No Caesar hath it not but you and I
[SHK] And honest Casca we have the falling sickness
[SHK] I know not what you mean by that but I am sure
[SHK] Caesar fell down If the tag-rag people did not
[SHK] clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and
[SHK] displeased them as they use to do the players in
[SHK] the theatre I am no true man
[SHK] What said he when he came unto himself
[SHK] Marry before he fell down when he perceived the
[SHK] common herd was glad he refused the crown he
[SHK] plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
[SHK] throat to cut An I had been a man of any
[SHK] occupation if I would not have taken him at a word
[SHK] I would I might go to hell among the rogues And so
[SHK] he fell When he came to himself again he said
[SHK] If he had done or said any thing amiss he desired
[SHK] their worships to think it was his infirmity Three
[SHK] or four wenches where I stood cried 'Alas good
[SHK] soul and forgave him with all their hearts but
[SHK] there 's no heed to be taken of them if Caesar had
[SHK] stabbed their mothers they would have done no less
[SHK] And after that he came thus sad away
[SHK] Ay
[SHK] Did Cicero say any thing
[SHK] Ay he spoke Greek
[SHK] To what effect
[SHK] Nay an I tell you that Ill ne'er look you i the
[SHK] face again but those that understood him smiled at
[SHK] one another and shook their heads but for mine own
[SHK] part it was Greek to me I could tell you more
[SHK] news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs
[SHK] off Caesar 's images are put to silence Fare you
[SHK] well There was more foolery yet if I could
[SHK] remember it
[SHK] Will you sup with me to-night Casca
[SHK] No I am promised forth
[SHK] Will you dine with me to-morrow
[SHK] Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
[SHK] worth the eating
[SHK] Good I will expect you
[SHK] Do so Farewell both
[SHK] What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
[SHK] He was quick mettle when he went to school
[SHK] So is he now in execution
[SHK] Of any bold or noble enterprise
[SHK] However he puts on this tardy form
[SHK] This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
[SHK] Which gives men stomach to digest his words
[SHK] With better appetite
[SHK] And so it is For this time I will leave you
[SHK] To-morrow if you please to speak with me
[SHK] I will come home to you or if you will
[SHK] Come home to me and I will wait for you
[SHK] I will do so till then think of the world
[SHK] Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see
[SHK] Thy honourable metal may be wrought
[SHK] From that it is disposed therefore it is meet
[SHK] That noble minds keep ever with their likes
[SHK] For who so firm that can not be seduced
[SHK] Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
[SHK] If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
[SHK] He should not humour me I will this night
[SHK] In several hands in at his windows throw
[SHK] As if they came from several citizens
[SHK] Writings all tending to the great opinion
[SHK] That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
[SHK] Caesar 's ambition shall be glanced at
[SHK] And after this let Caesar seat him sure
[SHK] For we will shake him or worse days endure
[SHK] Good even Casca brought you Caesar home
[SHK] Why are you breathless and why stare you so
[SHK] Are not you moved when all the sway of earth
[SHK] Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
[SHK] I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
[SHK] Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen
[SHK] The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
[SHK] To be exalted with the threatening clouds
[SHK] But never till to-night never till now
[SHK] Did I go through a tempest dropping fire
[SHK] Either there is a civil strife in heaven
[SHK] Or else the world too saucy with the gods
[SHK] Incenses them to send destruction
[SHK] Why saw you any thing more wonderful
[SHK] A common slave -- you know him well by sight --
[SHK] Held up his left hand which did flame and burn
[SHK] Like twenty torches join 'd and yet his hand
[SHK] Not sensible of fire remain 'd unscorch 'd
[SHK] Besides -- I ha not since put up my sword --
[SHK] Against the Capitol I met a lion
[SHK] Who glared upon me and went surly by
[SHK] Without annoying me and there were drawn
[SHK] Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
[SHK] Transformed with their fear who swore they saw
[SHK] Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
[SHK] And yesterday the bird of night did sit
[SHK] Even at noon-day upon the market-place
[SHK] Hooting and shrieking When these prodigies
[SHK] Do so conjointly meet let not men say
[SHK] 'These are their reasons they are natural
[SHK] For I believe they are portentous things
[SHK] Unto the climate that they point upon
[SHK] Indeed it is a strange-disposed time
[SHK] But men may construe things after their fashion
[SHK] Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
[SHK] Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow
[SHK] He doth for he did bid Antonius
[SHK] Send word to you he would be there to-morrow
[SHK] Good night then Casca this disturbed sky
[SHK] Is not to walk in
[SHK] Farewell Cicero
[SHK] Who 's there
[SHK] A Roman
[SHK] Casca by your voice
[SHK] Your ear is good Cassius what night is this
[SHK] A very pleasing night to honest men
[SHK] Who ever knew the heavens menace so
[SHK] Those that have known the earth so full of faults
[SHK] For my part I have walk 'd about the streets
[SHK] Submitting me unto the perilous night
[SHK] And thus unbraced Casca as you see
[SHK] Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone
[SHK] And when the cross blue lightning seem 'd to open
[SHK] The breast of heaven I did present myself
[SHK] Even in the aim and very flash of it
[SHK] But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
[SHK] It is the part of men to fear and tremble
[SHK] When the most mighty gods by tokens send
[SHK] Such dreadful heralds to astonish us
[SHK] You are dull Casca and those sparks of life
[SHK] That should be in a Roman you do want
[SHK] Or else you use not You look pale and gaze
[SHK] And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
[SHK] To see the strange impatience of the heavens
[SHK] But if you would consider the true cause
[SHK] Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
[SHK] Why birds and beasts from quality and kind
[SHK] Why old men fool and children calculate
[SHK] Why all these things change from their ordinance
[SHK] Their natures and preformed faculties
[SHK] To monstrous quality -- why you shall find
[SHK] That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
[SHK] To make them instruments of fear and warning
[SHK] Unto some monstrous state
[SHK] Now could I Casca name to thee a man
[SHK] Most like this dreadful night
[SHK] That thunders lightens opens graves and roars
[SHK] As doth the lion in the Capitol
[SHK] A man no mightier than thyself or me
[SHK] In personal action yet prodigious grown
[SHK] And fearful as these strange eruptions are
[SHK] 'T is Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius
[SHK] Let it be who it is for Romans now
[SHK] Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
[SHK] But woe the while our fathers minds are dead
[SHK] And we are govern 'd with our mothers spirits
[SHK] Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
[SHK] Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
[SHK] Mean to establish Caesar as a king
[SHK] And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
[SHK] In every place save here in Italy
[SHK] I know where I will wear this dagger then
[SHK] Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
[SHK] Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
[SHK] Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
[SHK] Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
[SHK] Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
[SHK] Can be retentive to the strength of spirit
[SHK] But life being weary of these worldly bars
[SHK] Never lacks power to dismiss itself
[SHK] If I know this know all the world besides
[SHK] That part of tyranny that I do bear
[SHK] I can shake off at pleasure
[SHK] So can I
[SHK] So every bondman in his own hand bears
[SHK] The power to cancel his captivity
[SHK] And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
[SHK] Poor man I know he would not be a wolf
[SHK] But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
[SHK] He were no lion were not Romans hinds
[SHK] Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
[SHK] Begin it with weak straws what trash is Rome
[SHK] What rubbish and what offal when it serves
[SHK] For the base matter to illuminate
[SHK] So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief
[SHK] Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
[SHK] Before a willing bondman then I know
[SHK] My answer must be made But I am arm 'd
[SHK] And dangers are to me indifferent
[SHK] You speak to Casca and to such a man
[SHK] That is no fleering tell-tale Hold my hand
[SHK] Be factious for redress of all these griefs
[SHK] And I will set this foot of mine as far
[SHK] As who goes farthest
[SHK] There 's a bargain made
[SHK] Now know you Casca I have moved already
[SHK] Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
[SHK] To undergo with me an enterprise
[SHK] Of honourable-dangerous consequence
[SHK] And I do know by this they stay for me
[SHK] In Pompey 's porch for now this fearful night
[SHK] There is no stir or walking in the streets
[SHK] And the complexion of the element
[SHK] In favour 's like the work we have in hand
[SHK] Most bloody fiery and most terrible
[SHK] Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
[SHK] 'T is Cinna I do know him by his gait
[SHK] He is a friend
[SHK] Cinna where haste you so
[SHK] To find out you Who 's that Metellus Cimber
[SHK] No it is Casca one incorporate
[SHK] To our attempts Am I not stay 'd for Cinna
[SHK] I am glad on 't What a fearful night is this
[SHK] There 's two or three of us have seen strange sights
[SHK] Am I not stay 'd for tell me
[SHK] Yes you are
[SHK] O Cassius if you could
[SHK] But win the noble Brutus to our party --
[SHK] Be you content good Cinna take this paper
[SHK] And look you lay it in the praetor 's chair
[SHK] Where Brutus may but find it and throw this
[SHK] In at his window set this up with wax
[SHK] Upon old Brutus statue all this done
[SHK] Repair to Pompey 's porch where you shall find us
[SHK] Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
[SHK] All but Metellus Cimber and he 's gone
[SHK] To seek you at your house Well I will hie
[SHK] And so bestow these papers as you bade me
[SHK] That done repair to Pompey 's theatre
[SHK] Come Casca you and I will yet ere day
[SHK] See Brutus at his house three parts of him
[SHK] Is ours already and the man entire
[SHK] Upon the next encounter yields him ours
[SHK] O he sits high in all the people 's hearts
[SHK] And that which would appear offence in us
[SHK] His countenance like richest alchemy
[SHK] Will change to virtue and to worthiness
[SHK] Him and his worth and our great need of him
[SHK] You have right well conceited Let us go
[SHK] For it is after midnight and ere day
[SHK] We will awake him and be sure of him
[SHK] What Lucius ho
[SHK] I can not by the progress of the stars
[SHK] Give guess how near to day Lucius I say
[SHK] I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
[SHK] When Lucius when awake I say what Lucius
[SHK] Call 'd you my lord
[SHK] Get me a taper in my study Lucius
[SHK] When it is lighted come and call me here
[SHK] I will my lord
[SHK] It must be by his death and for my part
[SHK] I know no personal cause to spurn at him
[SHK] But for the general He would be crown 'd
[SHK] How that might change his nature there 's the question
[SHK] It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
[SHK] And that craves wary walking Crown him -- that --
[SHK] And then I grant we put a sting in him
[SHK] That at his will he may do danger with
[SHK] The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
[SHK] Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar
[SHK] I have not known when his affections sway 'd
[SHK] More than his reason But 't is a common proof
[SHK] That lowliness is young ambition 's ladder
[SHK] Whereto the climber-upward turns his face
[SHK] But when he once attains the upmost round
[SHK] He then unto the ladder turns his back
[SHK] Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
[SHK] By which he did ascend So Caesar may
[SHK] Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
[SHK] Will bear no colour for the thing he is
[SHK] Fashion it thus that what he is augmented
[SHK] Would run to these and these extremities
[SHK] And therefore think him as a serpent 's egg
[SHK] Which hatch 'd would as his kind grow mischievous
[SHK] And kill him in the shell
[SHK] The taper burneth in your closet sir
[SHK] Searching the window for a flint I found
[SHK] This paper thus seal 'd up and I am sure
[SHK] It did not lie there when I went to bed
[SHK] Get you to bed again it is not day
[SHK] Is not to-morrow boy the ides of March
[SHK] I know not sir
[SHK] Look in the calendar and bring me word
[SHK] I will sir
[SHK] The exhalations whizzing in the air
[SHK] Give so much light that I may read by them
[SHK] 'Brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself
[SHK] Shall Rome c. Speak strike redress
[SHK] Brutus thou sleep'st awake
[SHK] Such instigations have been often dropp 'd
[SHK] Where I have took them up
[SHK] 'Shall Rome c. Thus must I piece it out
[SHK] Shall Rome stand under one man 's awe What Rome
[SHK] My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
[SHK] The Tarquin drive when he was call 'd a king
[SHK] 'Speak strike redress Am I entreated
[SHK] To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
[SHK] If the redress will follow thou receivest
[SHK] Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus
[SHK] Sir March is wasted fourteen days
[SHK] 'T is good Go to the gate somebody knocks
[SHK] Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
[SHK] I have not slept
[SHK] Between the acting of a dreadful thing
[SHK] And the first motion all the interim is
[SHK] Like a phantasma or a hideous dream
[SHK] The Genius and the mortal instruments
[SHK] Are then in council and the state of man
[SHK] Like to a little kingdom suffers then
[SHK] The nature of an insurrection
[SHK] Sir 't is your brother Cassius at the door
[SHK] Who doth desire to see you
[SHK] Is he alone
[SHK] No sir there are moe with him
[SHK] Do you know them
[SHK] No sir their hats are pluck 'd about their ears
[SHK] And half their faces buried in their cloaks
[SHK] That by no means I may discover them
[SHK] By any mark of favour
[SHK] Let 'em enter
[SHK] They are the faction O conspiracy
[SHK] Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
[SHK] When evils are most free O then by day
[SHK] Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
[SHK] To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracy
[SHK] Hide it in smiles and affability
[SHK] For if thou path thy native semblance on
[SHK] Not Erebus itself were dim enough
[SHK] To hide thee from prevention
[SHK] I think we are too bold upon your rest
[SHK] Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you
[SHK] I have been up this hour awake all night
[SHK] Know I these men that come along with you
[SHK] Yes every man of them and no man here
[SHK] But honours you and every one doth wish
[SHK] You had but that opinion of yourself
[SHK] Which every noble Roman bears of you
[SHK] This is Trebonius
[SHK] He is welcome hither
[SHK] This Decius Brutus
[SHK] He is welcome too
[SHK] This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
[SHK] They are all welcome
[SHK] What watchful cares do interpose themselves
[SHK] Betwixt your eyes and night
[SHK] Shall I entreat a word
[SHK] Here lies the east doth not the day break here
[SHK] No
[SHK] O pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines
[SHK] That fret the clouds are messengers of day
[SHK] You shall confess that you are both deceived
[SHK] Here as I point my sword the sun arises
[SHK] Which is a great way growing on the south
[SHK] Weighing the youthful season of the year
[SHK] Some two months hence up higher toward the north
[SHK] He first presents his fire and the high east
[SHK] Stands as the Capitol directly here
[SHK] Give me your hands all over one by one
[SHK] And let us swear our resolution
[SHK] No not an oath if not the face of men
[SHK] The sufferance of our souls the time 's abuse --
[SHK] If these be motives weak break off betimes
[SHK] And every man hence to his idle bed
[SHK] So let high-sighted tyranny range on
[SHK] Till each man drop by lottery But if these
[SHK] As I am sure they do bear fire enough
[SHK] To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
[SHK] The melting spirits of women then countrymen
[SHK] What need we any spur but our own cause
[SHK] To prick us to redress what other bond
[SHK] Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
[SHK] And will not palter and what other oath
[SHK] Than honesty to honesty engaged
[SHK] That this shall be or we will fall for it
[SHK] Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
[SHK] Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
[SHK] That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
[SHK] Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
[SHK] The even virtue of our enterprise
[SHK] Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
[SHK] To think that or our cause or our performance
[SHK] Did need an oath when every drop of blood
[SHK] That every Roman bears and nobly bears
[SHK] Is guilty of a several bastardy
[SHK] If he do break the smallest particle
[SHK] Of any promise that hath pass 'd from him
[SHK] But what of Cicero shall we sound him
[SHK] I think he will stand very strong with us
[SHK] Let us not leave him out
[SHK] No by no means
[SHK] O let us have him for his silver hairs
[SHK] Will purchase us a good opinion
[SHK] And buy men 's voices to commend our deeds
[SHK] It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
[SHK] Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
[SHK] But all be buried in his gravity
[SHK] O name him not let us not break with him
[SHK] For he will never follow any thing
[SHK] That other men begin
[SHK] Then leave him out
[SHK] Indeed he is not fit
[SHK] Shall no man else be touch 'd but only Caesar
[SHK] Decius well urged I think it is not meet
[SHK] Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar
[SHK] Should outlive Caesar we shall find of him
[SHK] A shrewd contriver and you know his means
[SHK] If he improve them may well stretch so far
[SHK] As to annoy us all which to prevent
[SHK] Let Antony and Caesar fall together
[SHK] Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
[SHK] To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
[SHK] Like wrath in death and envy afterwards
[SHK] For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
[SHK] Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
[SHK] We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar
[SHK] And in the spirit of men there is no blood
[SHK] O that we then could come by Caesar 's spirit
[SHK] And not dismember Caesar But alas
[SHK] Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends
[SHK] Let 's kill him boldly but not wrathfully
[SHK] Let 's carve him as a dish fit for the gods
[SHK] Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
[SHK] And let our hearts as subtle masters do
[SHK] Stir up their servants to an act of rage
[SHK] And after seem to chide 'em This shall make
[SHK] Our purpose necessary and not envious
[SHK] Which so appearing to the common eyes
[SHK] We shall be call 'd purgers not murderers
[SHK] And for Mark Antony think not of him
[SHK] For he can do no more than Caesar 's arm
[SHK] When Caesar 's head is off
[SHK] Yet I fear him
[SHK] For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar --
[SHK] Alas good Cassius do not think of him
[SHK] If he love Caesar all that he can do
[SHK] Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar
[SHK] And that were much he should for he is given
[SHK] To sports to wildness and much company
[SHK] There is no fear in him let him not die
[SHK] For he will live and laugh at this hereafter
[SHK] Peace count the clock
[SHK] The clock hath stricken three
[SHK] 'T is time to part
[SHK] But it is doubtful yet
[SHK] Whether Caesar will come forth to-day or no
[SHK] For he is superstitious grown of late
[SHK] Quite from the main opinion he held once
[SHK] Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
[SHK] It may be these apparent prodigies
[SHK] The unaccustom 'd terror of this night
[SHK] And the persuasion of his augurers
[SHK] May hold him from the Capitol to-day
[SHK] Never fear that if he be so resolved
[SHK] I can o'ersway him for he loves to hear
[SHK] That unicorns may be betray 'd with trees
[SHK] And bears with glasses elephants with holes
[SHK] Lions with toils and men with flatterers
[SHK] But when I tell him he hates flatterers
[SHK] He says he does being then most flattered
[SHK] Let me work
[SHK] For I can give his humour the true bent
[SHK] And I will bring him to the Capitol
[SHK] Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
[SHK] By the eighth hour is that the uttermost
[SHK] Be that the uttermost and fail not then
[SHK] Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
[SHK] Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
[SHK] I wonder none of you have thought of him
[SHK] Now good Metellus go along by him
[SHK] He loves me well and I have given him reasons
[SHK] Send him but hither and I 'll fashion him
[SHK] The morning comes upon 's we 'll leave you Brutus
[SHK] And friends disperse yourselves but all remember
[SHK] What you have said and show yourselves true Romans
[SHK] Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
[SHK] Let not our looks put on our purposes
[SHK] But bear it as our Roman actors do
[SHK] With untired spirits and formal constancy
[SHK] And so good morrow to you every one
[SHK] Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter
[SHK] Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber
[SHK] Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
[SHK] Which busy care draws in the brains of men
[SHK] Therefore thou sleep'st so sound
[SHK] Brutus my lord
[SHK] Portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
[SHK] It is not for your health thus to commit
[SHK] Your weak condition to the raw cold morning
[SHK] Nor for yours neither You 've ungently Brutus
[SHK] Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
[SHK] You suddenly arose and walk 'd about
[SHK] Musing and sighing with your arms across
[SHK] And when I ask 'd you what the matter was
[SHK] You stared upon me with ungentle looks
[SHK] I urged you further then you scratch 'd your head
[SHK] And too impatiently stamp 'd with your foot
[SHK] Yet I insisted yet you answer 'd not
[SHK] But with an angry wafture of your hand
[SHK] Gave sign for me to leave you so I did
[SHK] Fearing to strengthen that impatience
[SHK] Which seem 'd too much enkindled and withal
[SHK] Hoping it was but an effect of humour
[SHK] Which sometime hath his hour with every man
[SHK] It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
[SHK] And could it work so much upon your shape
[SHK] As it hath much prevail 'd on your condition
[SHK] I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
[SHK] Make me acquainted with your cause of grief
[SHK] I am not well in health and that is all
[SHK] Brutus is wise and were he not in health
[SHK] He would embrace the means to come by it
[SHK] Why so I do Good Portia go to bed
[SHK] Is Brutus sick and is it physical
[SHK] To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
[SHK] Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick
[SHK] And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
[SHK] To dare the vile contagion of the night
[SHK] And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
[SHK] To add unto his sickness No my Brutus
[SHK] You have some sick offence within your mind
[SHK] Which by the right and virtue of my place
[SHK] I ought to know of and upon my knees
[SHK] I charm you by my once-commended beauty
[SHK] By all your vows of love and that great vow
[SHK] Which did incorporate and make us one
[SHK] That you unfold to me yourself your half
[SHK] Why you are heavy and what men to-night
[SHK] Have had to resort to you for here have been
[SHK] Some six or seven who did hide their faces
[SHK] Even from darkness
[SHK] Kneel not gentle Portia
[SHK] I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
[SHK] Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
[SHK] Is it excepted I should know no secrets
[SHK] That appertain to you Am I yourself
[SHK] But as it were in sort or limitation
[SHK] To keep with you at meals comfort your bed
[SHK] And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
[SHK] Of your good pleasure If it be no more
[SHK] Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife
[SHK] You are my true and honourable wife
[SHK] As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
[SHK] That visit my sad heart
[SHK] If this were true then should I know this secret
[SHK] I grant I am a woman but withal
[SHK] A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
[SHK] I grant I am a woman but withal
[SHK] A woman well-reputed Cato 's daughter
[SHK] Think you I am no stronger than my sex
[SHK] Being so father 'd and so husbanded
[SHK] Tell me your counsels I will not disclose 'em
[SHK] I have made strong proof of my constancy
[SHK] Giving myself a voluntary wound
[SHK] Here in the thigh can I bear that with patience
[SHK] And not my husband 's secrets
[SHK] O ye gods
[SHK] Render me worthy of this noble wife
[SHK] Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile
[SHK] And by and by thy bosom shall partake
[SHK] The secrets of my heart
[SHK] All my engagements I will construe to thee
[SHK] All the charactery of my sad brows
[SHK] Leave me with haste
[SHK] Lucius who 's that knocks
[SHK] He is a sick man that would speak with you
[SHK] Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of
[SHK] Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how
[SHK] Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
[SHK] O what a time have you chose out brave Caius
[SHK] To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick
[SHK] I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
[SHK] Any exploit worthy the name of honour
[SHK] Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius
[SHK] Had you a healthful ear to hear of it
[SHK] By all the gods that Romans bow before
[SHK] I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome
[SHK] Brave son derived from honourable loins
[SHK] Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
[SHK] My mortified spirit Now bid me run
[SHK] And I will strive with things impossible
[SHK] Yea get the better of them What 's to do
[SHK] A piece of work that will make sick men whole
[SHK] But are not some whole that we must make sick
[SHK] That must we also What it is my Caius
[SHK] I shall unfold to thee as we are going
[SHK] To whom it must be done
[SHK] Set on your foot
[SHK] And with a heart new-fired I follow you
[SHK] To do I know not what but it sufficeth
[SHK] That Brutus leads me on
[SHK] Follow me then
[SHK] Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night
[SHK] Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out
[SHK] 'Help ho they murder Caesar Who 's within
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
[SHK] And bring me their opinions of success
[SHK] I will my lord
[SHK] What mean you Caesar think you to walk forth
[SHK] You shall not stir out of your house to-day
[SHK] Caesar shall forth the things that threaten 'd me
[SHK] Ne'er look 'd but on my back when they shall see
[SHK] The face of Caesar they are vanished
[SHK] Caesar I never stood on ceremonies
[SHK] Yet now they fright me There is one within
[SHK] Besides the things that we have heard and seen
[SHK] Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
[SHK] A lioness hath whelped in the streets
[SHK] And graves have yawn 'd and yielded up their dead
[SHK] Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
[SHK] In ranks and squadrons and right form of war
[SHK] Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
[SHK] The noise of battle hurtled in the air
[SHK] Horses did neigh and dying men did groan
[SHK] And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
[SHK] O Caesar these things are beyond all use
[SHK] And I do fear them
[SHK] What can be avoided
[SHK] Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
[SHK] Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions
[SHK] Are to the world in general as to Caesar
[SHK] When beggars die there are no comets seen
[SHK] The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
[SHK] Cowards die many times before their deaths
[SHK] The valiant never taste of death but once
[SHK] Of all the wonders that I yet have heard
[SHK] It seems to me most strange that men should fear
[SHK] Seeing that death a necessary end
[SHK] Will come when it will come
[SHK] What say the augurers
[SHK] They would not have you to stir forth to-day
[SHK] Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
[SHK] They could not find a heart within the beast
[SHK] The gods do this in shame of cowardice
[SHK] Caesar should be a beast without a heart
[SHK] If he should stay at home to-day for fear
[SHK] No Caesar shall not danger knows full well
[SHK] That Caesar is more dangerous than he
[SHK] We are two lions litter 'd in one day
[SHK] And I the elder and more terrible
[SHK] And Caesar shall go forth
[SHK] Alas my lord
[SHK] Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
[SHK] Do not go forth to-day call it my fear
[SHK] That keeps you in the house and not your own
[SHK] We 'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house
[SHK] And he shall say you are not well to-day
[SHK] Let me upon my knee prevail in this
[SHK] Mark Antony shall say I am not well
[SHK] And for thy humour I will stay at home
[SHK] Here 's Decius Brutus he shall tell them so
[SHK] Caesar all hail good morrow worthy Caesar
[SHK] I come to fetch you to the senate-house
[SHK] And you are come in very happy time
[SHK] To bear my greeting to the senators
[SHK] And tell them that I will not come to-day
[SHK] Can not is false and that I dare not falser
[SHK] I will not come to-day tell them so Decius
[SHK] Say he is sick
[SHK] Shall Caesar send a lie
[SHK] Have I in conquest stretch 'd mine arm so far
[SHK] To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
[SHK] Decius go tell them Caesar will not come
[SHK] Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause
[SHK] Lest I be laugh 'd at when I tell them so
[SHK] The cause is in my will I will not come
[SHK] That is enough to satisfy the senate
[SHK] But for your private satisfaction
[SHK] Because I love you I will let you know
[SHK] Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
[SHK] She dreamt to-night she saw my statua
[SHK] Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
[SHK] Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans
[SHK] Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
[SHK] And these does she apply for warnings and portents
[SHK] And evils imminent and on her knee
[SHK] Hath begg 'd that I will stay at home to-day
[SHK] This dream is all amiss interpreted
[SHK] It was a vision fair and fortunate
[SHK] Your statue spouting blood in many pipes
[SHK] In which so many smiling Romans bathed
[SHK] Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
[SHK] Reviving blood and that great men shall press
[SHK] For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
[SHK] This by Calpurnia 's dream is signified
[SHK] And this way have you well expounded it
[SHK] I have when you have heard what I can say
[SHK] And know it now the senate have concluded
[SHK] To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
[SHK] If you shall send them word you will not come
[SHK] Their minds may change Besides it were a mock
[SHK] Apt to be render 'd for some one to say
[SHK] 'Break up the senate till another time
[SHK] When Caesar 's wife shall meet with better dreams
[SHK] If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
[SHK] 'Lo Caesar is afraid
[SHK] Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
[SHK] To our proceeding bids me tell you this
[SHK] And reason to my love is liable
[SHK] How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia
[SHK] I am ashamed I did yield to them
[SHK] Give me my robe for I will go
[SHK] And look where Publius is come to fetch me
[SHK] Good morrow Caesar
[SHK] Welcome Publius
[SHK] What Brutus are you stirr 'd so early too
[SHK] Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius
[SHK] Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
[SHK] As that same ague which hath made you lean
[SHK] What is 't o'clock
[SHK] Caesar 't is strucken eight
[SHK] I thank you for your pains and courtesy
[SHK] See Antony that revels long o nights
[SHK] Is notwithstanding up Good morrow Antony
[SHK] So to most noble Caesar
[SHK] Bid them prepare within
[SHK] I am to blame to be thus waited for
[SHK] Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius
[SHK] I have an hour 's talk in store for you
[SHK] Remember that you call on me to-day
[SHK] Be near me that I may remember you
[SHK] Caesar I will
[SHK] and so near will I be
[SHK] That your best friends shall wish I had been further
[SHK] Good friends go in and taste some wine with me
[SHK] And we like friends will straightway go together
[SHK] The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon
[SHK] 'Caesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius
[SHK] come not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not
[SHK] Trebonius mark well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus
[SHK] loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius
[SHK] There is but one mind in all these men and it is
[SHK] bent against Caesar If thou beest not immortal
[SHK] look about you security gives way to conspiracy
[SHK] The mighty gods defend thee Thy lover
[SHK] 'ARTEMIDORUS
[SHK] Here will I stand till Caesar pass along
[SHK] And as a suitor will I give him this
[SHK] My heart laments that virtue can not live
[SHK] Out of the teeth of emulation
[SHK] If thou read this O Caesar thou mayst live
[SHK] If not the Fates with traitors do contrive
[SHK] I prithee boy run to the senate-house
[SHK] Stay not to answer me but get thee gone
[SHK] Why dost thou stay
[SHK] To know my errand madam
[SHK] I would have had thee there and here again
[SHK] Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
[SHK] O constancy be strong upon my side
[SHK] Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue
[SHK] I have a man 's mind but a woman 's might
[SHK] How hard it is for women to keep counsel
[SHK] Art thou here yet
[SHK] Madam what should I do
[SHK] Run to the Capitol and nothing else
[SHK] And so return to you and nothing else
[SHK] Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well
[SHK] For he went sickly forth and take good note
[SHK] What Caesar doth what suitors press to him
[SHK] Hark boy what noise is that
[SHK] I hear none madam
[SHK] Prithee listen well
[SHK] I heard a bustling rumour like a fray
[SHK] And the wind brings it from the Capitol
[SHK] Sooth madam I hear nothing
[SHK] Come hither fellow which way hast thou been
[SHK] At mine own house good lady
[SHK] What is't o'clock
[SHK] About the ninth hour lady
[SHK] Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol
[SHK] Madam not yet I go to take my stand
[SHK] To see him pass on to the Capitol
[SHK] Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not
[SHK] That I have lady if it will please Caesar
[SHK] To be so good to Caesar as to hear me
[SHK] I shall beseech him to befriend himself
[SHK] Why know'st thou any harm 's intended towards him
[SHK] None that I know will be much that I fear may chance
[SHK] Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow
[SHK] The throng that follows Caesar at the heels
[SHK] Of senators of praetors common suitors
[SHK] Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
[SHK] I 'll get me to a place more void and there
[SHK] Speak to great Caesar as he comes along
[SHK] I must go in Ay me how weak a thing
[SHK] The heart of woman is O Brutus
[SHK] The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise
[SHK] Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit
[SHK] That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint
[SHK] Run Lucius and commend me to my lord
[SHK] Say I am merry come to me again
[SHK] And bring me word what he doth say to thee
[SHK] Ay Caesar but not gone
[SHK] Hail Caesar read this schedule
[SHK] Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread
[SHK] At your best leisure this his humble suit
[SHK] O Caesar read mine first for mine 's a suit
[SHK] That touches Caesar nearer read it great Caesar
[SHK] What touches us ourself shall be last served
[SHK] Delay not Caesar read it instantly
[SHK] What is the fellow mad
[SHK] Sirrah give place
[SHK] What urge you your petitions in the street
[SHK] Come to the Capitol
[SHK] I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive
[SHK] What enterprise Popilius
[SHK] Fare you well
[SHK] What said Popilius Lena
[SHK] He wish 'd to-day our enterprise might thrive
[SHK] I fear our purpose is discovered
[SHK] Look how he makes to Caesar mark him
[SHK] Casca be sudden for we fear prevention
[SHK] Brutus what shall be done If this be known
[SHK] Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back
[SHK] For I will slay myself
[SHK] Cassius be constant
[SHK] Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes
[SHK] For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change
[SHK] Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus
[SHK] He draws Mark Antony out of the way
[SHK] Where is Metellus Cimber Let him go
[SHK] And presently prefer his suit to Caesar
[SHK] He is address 'd press near and second him
[SHK] Casca you are the first that rears your hand
[SHK] Are we all ready What is now amiss
[SHK] That Caesar and his senate must redress
[SHK] Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar
[SHK] Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
[SHK] An humble heart --
[SHK] I must prevent thee Cimber
[SHK] These couchings and these lowly courtesies
[SHK] Might fire the blood of ordinary men
[SHK] And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
[SHK] Into the law of children Be not fond
[SHK] To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
[SHK] That will be thaw 'd from the true quality
[SHK] With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words
[SHK] Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning
[SHK] Thy brother by decree is banished
[SHK] If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
[SHK] I spurn thee like a cur out of my way
[SHK] Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
[SHK] Will he be satisfied
[SHK] Is there no voice more worthy than my own
[SHK] To sound more sweetly in great Caesar 's ear
[SHK] For the repealing of my banish 'd brother
[SHK] I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar
[SHK] Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
[SHK] Have an immediate freedom of repeal
[SHK] What Brutus
[SHK] Pardon Caesar Caesar pardon
[SHK] As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
[SHK] To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber
[SHK] I could be well moved if I were as you
[SHK] If I could pray to move prayers would move me
[SHK] But I am constant as the northern star
[SHK] Of whose true-fix 'd and resting quality
[SHK] There is no fellow in the firmament
[SHK] The skies are painted with unnumber 'd sparks
[SHK] They are all fire and every one doth shine
[SHK] But there 's but one in all doth hold his place
[SHK] So in the world 't is furnish 'd well with men
[SHK] And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
[SHK] Yet in the number I do know but one
[SHK] That unassailable holds on his rank
[SHK] Unshaked of motion and that I am he
[SHK] Let me a little show it even in this
[SHK] That I was constant Cimber should be banish 'd
[SHK] And constant do remain to keep him so
[SHK] O Caesar --
[SHK] Hence wilt thou lift up Olympus
[SHK] Great Caesar --
[SHK] Doth not Brutus bootless kneel
[SHK] Speak hands for me
[SHK] Et tu Brute Then fall Caesar
[SHK] Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead
[SHK] Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
[SHK] Some to the common pulpits and cry out
[SHK] 'Liberty freedom and enfranchisement
[SHK] People and senators be not affrighted
[SHK] Fly not stand stiff ambition 's debt is paid
[SHK] Go to the pulpit Brutus
[SHK] And Cassius too
[SHK] Where 's Publius
[SHK] Here quite confounded with this mutiny
[SHK] Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesar 's
[SHK] Should chance --
[SHK] Talk not of standing Publius good cheer
[SHK] There is no harm intended to your person
[SHK] Nor to no Roman else so tell them Publius
[SHK] And leave us Publius lest that the people
[SHK] Rushing on us should do your age some mischief
[SHK] Do so and let no man abide this deed
[SHK] But we the doers
[SHK] Where is Antony
[SHK] Fled to his house amazed
[SHK] Men wives and children stare cry out and run
[SHK] As it were doomsday
[SHK] Fates we will know your pleasures
[SHK] That we shall die we know 't is but the time
[SHK] And drawing days out that men stand upon
[SHK] Why he that cuts off twenty years of life
[SHK] Cuts off so many years of fearing death
[SHK] Grant that and then is death a benefit
[SHK] So are we Caesar 's friends that have abridged
[SHK] His time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop
[SHK] And let us bathe our hands in Caesar 's blood
[SHK] Up to the elbows and besmear our swords
[SHK] Then walk we forth even to the market-place
[SHK] And waving our red weapons o'er our heads
[SHK] Let 's all cry 'Peace freedom and liberty
[SHK] Stoop then and wash. How many ages hence
[SHK] Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
[SHK] In states unborn and accents yet unknown
[SHK] How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
[SHK] That now on Pompey 's basis lies along
[SHK] No worthier than the dust
[SHK] So oft as that shall be
[SHK] So often shall the knot of us be call 'd
[SHK] The men that gave their country liberty
[SHK] What shall we forth
[SHK] Ay every man away
[SHK] Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
[SHK] With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome
[SHK] Soft who comes here A friend of Antony 's
[SHK] Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
[SHK] Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
[SHK] And being prostrate thus he bade me say
[SHK] Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
[SHK] Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
[SHK] Say I love Brutus and I honour him
[SHK] Say I fear 'd Caesar honour 'd him and loved him
[SHK] If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
[SHK] May safely come to him and be resolved
[SHK] How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
[SHK] Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
[SHK] So well as Brutus living but will follow
[SHK] The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
[SHK] Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
[SHK] With all true faith So says my master Antony
[SHK] Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
[SHK] I never thought him worse
[SHK] Tell him so please him come unto this place
[SHK] He shall be satisfied and by my honour
[SHK] Depart untouch 'd
[SHK] I 'll fetch him presently
[SHK] I know that we shall have him well to friend
[SHK] I wish we may but yet have I a mind
[SHK] That fears him much and my misgiving still
[SHK] Falls shrewdly to the purpose
[SHK] But here comes Antony
[SHK] Welcome Mark Antony
[SHK] O mighty Caesar dost thou lie so low
[SHK] Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
[SHK] Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well
[SHK] I know not gentlemen what you intend
[SHK] Who else must be let blood who else is rank
[SHK] If I myself there is no hour so fit
[SHK] As Caesar 's death hour nor no instrument
[SHK] Of half that worth as those your swords made rich
[SHK] With the most noble blood of all this world
[SHK] I do beseech ye if you bear me hard
[SHK] Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
[SHK] Fulfil your pleasure Live a thousand years
[SHK] I shall not find myself so apt to die
[SHK] No place will please me so no mean of death
[SHK] As here by Caesar and by you cut off
[SHK] The choice and master spirits of this age
[SHK] O Antony beg not your death of us
[SHK] Though now we must appear bloody and cruel
[SHK] As by our hands and this our present act
[SHK] You see we do yet see you but our hands
[SHK] And this the bleeding business they have done
[SHK] Our hearts you see not they are pitiful
[SHK] And pity to the general wrong of Rome --
[SHK] As fire drives out fire so pity pity --
[SHK] Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part
[SHK] To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
[SHK] Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
[SHK] Of brothers temper do receive you in
[SHK] With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
[SHK] Your voice shall be as strong as any man 's
[SHK] In the disposing of new dignities
[SHK] Only be patient till we have appeased
[SHK] The multitude beside themselves with fear
[SHK] And then we will deliver you the cause
[SHK] Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him
[SHK] Have thus proceeded
[SHK] I doubt not of your wisdom
[SHK] Let each man render me his bloody hand
[SHK] First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you
[SHK] Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand
[SHK] Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus
[SHK] Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours
[SHK] Though last not last in love yours good Trebonius
[SHK] Gentlemen all -- alas what shall I say
[SHK] My credit now stands on such slippery ground
[SHK] That one of two bad ways you must conceit me
[SHK] Either a coward or a flatterer
[SHK] That I did love thee Caesar O 't is true
[SHK] If then thy spirit look upon us now
[SHK] Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
[SHK] To see thy thy Anthony making his peace
[SHK] Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
[SHK] Most noble in the presence of thy corse
[SHK] Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
[SHK] Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
[SHK] It would become me better than to close
[SHK] In terms of friendship with thine enemies
[SHK] Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bay 'd brave hart
[SHK] Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
[SHK] Sign 'd in thy spoil and crimson 'd in thy lethe
[SHK] O world thou wast the forest to this hart
[SHK] And this indeed O world the heart of thee
[SHK] How like a deer strucken by many princes
[SHK] Dost thou here lie
[SHK] Mark Antony --
[SHK] Pardon me Caius Cassius
[SHK] The enemies of Caesar shall say this
[SHK] Then in a friend it is cold modesty
[SHK] I blame you not for praising Caesar so
[SHK] But what compact mean you to have with us
[SHK] Will you be prick 'd in number of our friends
[SHK] Or shall we on and not depend on you
[SHK] Therefore I took your hands but was indeed
[SHK] Sway 'd from the point by looking down on Caesar
[SHK] Friends am I with you all and love you all
[SHK] Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
[SHK] Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous
[SHK] Or else were this a savage spectacle
[SHK] Our reasons are so full of good regard
[SHK] That were you Antony the son of Caesar
[SHK] You should be satisfied
[SHK] That 's all I seek
[SHK] And am moreover suitor that I may
[SHK] Produce his body to the market-place
[SHK] And in the pulpit as becomes a friend
[SHK] Speak in the order of his funeral
[SHK] You shall Mark Antony
[SHK] Brutus a word with you
[SHK] You know not what you do do not consent
[SHK] That Antony speak in his funeral
[SHK] Know you how much the people may be moved
[SHK] By that which he will utter
[SHK] By your pardon
[SHK] I will myself into the pulpit first
[SHK] And show the reason of our Caesar 's death
[SHK] What Antony shall speak I will protest
[SHK] He speaks by leave and by permission
[SHK] And that we are contented Caesar shall
[SHK] Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
[SHK] It shall advantage more than do us wrong
[SHK] I know not what may fall I like it not
[SHK] Mark Antony here take you Caesar 's body
[SHK] You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
[SHK] But speak all good you can devise of Caesar
[SHK] And say you do't by our permission
[SHK] Else shall you not have any hand at all
[SHK] About his funeral and you shall speak
[SHK] In the same pulpit whereto I am going
[SHK] After my speech is ended
[SHK] Be it so
[SHK] I do desire no more
[SHK] Prepare the body then and follow us
[SHK] O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
[SHK] That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
[SHK] Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
[SHK] That ever lived in the tide of times
[SHK] Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
[SHK] Over thy wounds now do I prophesy --
[SHK] Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
[SHK] To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue --
[SHK] A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
[SHK] Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
[SHK] Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
[SHK] Blood and destruction shall be so in use
[SHK] And dreadful objects so familiar
[SHK] That mothers shall but smile when they behold
[SHK] Their infants quarter 'd with the hands of war
[SHK] All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
[SHK] And Caesar 's spirit ranging for revenge
[SHK] With Ate by his side come hot from hell
[SHK] Shall in these confines with a monarch 's voice
[SHK] Cry 'Havoc and let slip the dogs of war
[SHK] That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
[SHK] With carrion men groaning for burial
[SHK] You serve Octavius Caesar do you not
[SHK] I do Mark Antony
[SHK] Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
[SHK] He did receive his letters and is coming
[SHK] And bid me say to you by word of mouth --
[SHK] O Caesar --
[SHK] Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
[SHK] Passion I see is catching for mine eyes
[SHK] Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
[SHK] Began to water Is thy master coming
[SHK] He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome
[SHK] Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
[SHK] Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome
[SHK] No Rome of safety for Octavius yet
[SHK] Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile
[SHK] Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
[SHK] Into the market-place there shall I try
[SHK] In my oration how the people take
[SHK] The cruel issue of these bloody men
[SHK] According to the which thou shalt discourse
[SHK] To young Octavius of the state of things
[SHK] Lend me your hand
[SHK] We will be satisfied let us be satisfied
[SHK] Then follow me and give me audience friends
[SHK] Cassius go you into the other street
[SHK] And part the numbers
[SHK] Those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here
[SHK] Those that will follow Cassius go with him
[SHK] And public reasons shall be rendered
[SHK] Of Caesar 's death
[SHK] I will hear Brutus speak
[SHK] I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons
[SHK] When severally we hear them rendered
[SHK] The noble Brutus is ascended silence
[SHK] Be patient till the last
[SHK] Romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my
[SHK] cause and be silent that you may hear believe me
[SHK] for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that
[SHK] you may believe censure me in your wisdom and
[SHK] awake your senses that you may the better judge
[SHK] If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of
[SHK] Caesar 's to him I say that Brutus love to Caesar
[SHK] was no less than his If then that friend demand
[SHK] why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer
[SHK] -- Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved
[SHK] Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and
[SHK] die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live
[SHK] all free men As Caesar loved me I weep for him
[SHK] as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was
[SHK] valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I
[SHK] slew him There is tears for his love joy for his
[SHK] fortune honour for his valour and death for his
[SHK] ambition Who is here so base that would be a
[SHK] bondman If any speak for him have I offended
[SHK] Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If
[SHK] any speak for him have I offended Who is here so
[SHK] vile that will not love his country If any speak
[SHK] for him have I offended I pause for a reply
[SHK] None Brutus none
[SHK] Then none have I offended I have done no more to
[SHK] Caesar than you shall do to Brutus The question of
[SHK] his death is enrolled in the Capitol his glory not
[SHK] extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences
[SHK] enforced for which he suffered death
[SHK] Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who
[SHK] though he had no hand in his death shall receive
[SHK] the benefit of his dying a place in the
[SHK] commonwealth as which of you shall not With this
[SHK] I depart -- that as I slew my best lover for the
[SHK] good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself
[SHK] when it shall please my country to need my death
[SHK] Live Brutus live live
[SHK] Bring him with triumph home unto his house
[SHK] Give him a statue with his ancestors
[SHK] Let him be Caesar
[SHK] Caesar 's better parts
[SHK] Shall be crown 'd in Brutus
[SHK] We 'll bring him to his house
[SHK] With shouts and clamours
[SHK] My countrymen --
[SHK] Peace silence Brutus speaks
[SHK] Peace ho
[SHK] Good countrymen let me depart alone
[SHK] And for my sake stay here with Antony
[SHK] Do grace to Caesar 's corpse and grace his speech
[SHK] Tending to Caesar 's glories which Mark Antony
[SHK] By our permission is allow 'd to make
[SHK] I do entreat you not a man depart
[SHK] Save I alone till Antony have spoke
[SHK] Stay ho and let us hear Mark Antony
[SHK] Let him go up into the public chair
[SHK] We 'll hear him Noble Antony go up
[SHK] For Brutus sake I am beholding to you
[SHK] What does he say of Brutus
[SHK] He says for Brutus sake
[SHK] He finds himself beholding to us all
[SHK] 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here
[SHK] This Caesar was a tyrant
[SHK] Nay that 's certain
[SHK] We are blest that Rome is rid of him
[SHK] Peace let us hear what Antony can say
[SHK] You gentle Romans --
[SHK] Peace ho let us hear him
[SHK] Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
[SHK] I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
[SHK] The evil that men do lives after them
[SHK] The good is oft interred with their bones
[SHK] So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
[SHK] Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
[SHK] If it were so it was a grievous fault
[SHK] And grievously hath Caesar answer 'd it
[SHK] Here under leave of Brutus and the rest --
[SHK] For Brutus is an honourable man
[SHK] So are they all all honourable men --
[SHK] Come I to speak in Caesar 's funeral
[SHK] He was my friend faithful and just to me
[SHK] But Brutus says he was ambitious
[SHK] And Brutus is an honourable man
[SHK] He hath brought many captives home to Rome
[SHK] Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
[SHK] Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
[SHK] When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
[SHK] Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
[SHK] Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
[SHK] And Brutus is an honourable man
[SHK] You all did see that on the Lupercal
[SHK] I thrice presented him a kingly crown
[SHK] Which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
[SHK] Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
[SHK] And sure he is an honourable man
[SHK] I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
[SHK] But here I am to speak what I do know
[SHK] You all did love him once not without cause
[SHK] What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
[SHK] O judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
[SHK] And men have lost their reason Bear with me
[SHK] My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
[SHK] And I must pause till it come back to me
[SHK] Methinks there is much reason in his sayings
[SHK] If thou consider rightly of the matter
[SHK] Caesar has had great wrong
[SHK] Has he masters
[SHK] I fear there will a worse come in his place
[SHK] Mark 'd ye his words He would not take the crown
[SHK] Therefore 't is certain he was not ambitious
[SHK] If it be found so some will dear abide it
[SHK] Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
[SHK] There 's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
[SHK] Now mark him he begins again to speak
[SHK] But yesterday the word of Caesar might
[SHK] Have stood against the world now lies he there
[SHK] And none so poor to do him reverence
[SHK] O masters if I were disposed to stir
[SHK] Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
[SHK] I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
[SHK] Who you all know are honourable men
[SHK] I will not do them wrong I rather choose
[SHK] To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
[SHK] Than I will wrong such honourable men
[SHK] But here 's a parchment with the seal of Caesar
[SHK] I found it in his closet 't is his will
[SHK] Let but the commons hear this testament --
[SHK] Which pardon me I do not mean to read --
[SHK] And they would go and kiss dead Caesar 's wounds
[SHK] And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
[SHK] Yea beg a hair of him for memory
[SHK] And dying mention it within their wills
[SHK] Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
[SHK] Unto their issue
[SHK] We 'll hear the will read it Mark Antony
[SHK] The will the will we will hear Caesar 's will
[SHK] Have patience gentle friends I must not read it
[SHK] It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
[SHK] You are not wood you are not stones but men
[SHK] And being men bearing the will of Caesar
[SHK] It will inflame you it will make you mad
[SHK] 'T is good you know not that you are his heirs
[SHK] For if you should O what would come of it
[SHK] Read the will we 'll hear it Antony
[SHK] You shall read us the will Caesar 's will
[SHK] Will you be patient will you stay awhile
[SHK] I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
[SHK] I fear I wrong the honourable men
[SHK] Whose daggers have stabb 'd Caesar I do fear it
[SHK] They were traitors honourable men
[SHK] The will the testament
[SHK] They were villains murderers the will read the will
[SHK] You will compel me then to read the will
[SHK] Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar
[SHK] And let me show you him that made the will
[SHK] Shall I descend and will you give me leave
[SHK] Come down
[SHK] Descend
[SHK] You shall have leave
[SHK] A ring stand round
[SHK] Stand from the hearse stand from the body
[SHK] Room for Antony most noble Antony
[SHK] Nay press not so upon me stand far off
[SHK] Stand back room bear back
[SHK] If you have tears prepare to shed them now
[SHK] You all do know this mantle I remember
[SHK] The first time ever Caesar put it on
[SHK] 'T was on a summer 's evening in his tent
[SHK] That day he overcame the Nervii
[SHK] Look in this place ran Cassius dagger through
[SHK] See what a rent the envious Casca made
[SHK] Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb 'd
[SHK] And as he pluck 'd his cursed steel away
[SHK] Mark how the blood of Caesar follow 'd it
[SHK] As rushing out of doors to be resolved
[SHK] If Brutus so unkindly knock 'd or no
[SHK] For Brutus as you know was Caesar 's angel
[SHK] Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
[SHK] This was the most unkindest cut of all
[SHK] For when the noble Caesar saw him stab
[SHK] Ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
[SHK] Quite vanquish 'd him then burst his mighty heart
[SHK] And in his mantle muffling up his face
[SHK] Even at the base of Pompey 's statua
[SHK] Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
[SHK] O what a fall was there my countrymen
[SHK] Then I and you and all of us fell down
[SHK] Whilst bloody treason flourish 'd over us
[SHK] O now you weep and I perceive you feel
[SHK] The dint of pity these are gracious drops
[SHK] Kind souls what weep you when you but behold
[SHK] Our Caesar 's vesture wounded Look you here
[SHK] Here is himself marr 'd as you see with traitors
[SHK] O piteous spectacle
[SHK] O noble Caesar
[SHK] O woful day
[SHK] O traitors villains
[SHK] O most bloody sight
[SHK] We will be revenged
[SHK] Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill Slay
[SHK] Let not a traitor live
[SHK] Stay countrymen
[SHK] Peace there hear the noble Antony
[SHK] We 'll hear him we 'll follow him we 'll die with him
[SHK] Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
[SHK] To such a sudden flood of mutiny
[SHK] They that have done this deed are honourable
[SHK] What private griefs they have alas I know not
[SHK] That made them do it they are wise and honourable
[SHK] And will no doubt with reasons answer you
[SHK] I come not friends to steal away your hearts
[SHK] I am no orator as Brutus is
[SHK] But as you know me all a plain blunt man
[SHK] That love my friend and that they know full well
[SHK] That gave me public leave to speak of him
[SHK] For I have neither wit nor words nor worth
[SHK] Action nor utterance nor the power of speech
[SHK] To stir men 's blood I only speak right on
[SHK] I tell you that which you yourselves do know
[SHK] Show you sweet Caesar 's wounds poor poor dumb mouths
[SHK] And bid them speak for me but were I Brutus
[SHK] And Brutus Antony there were an Antony
[SHK] Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
[SHK] In every wound of Caesar that should move
[SHK] The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
[SHK] We 'll mutiny
[SHK] We 'll burn the house of Brutus
[SHK] Away then come seek the conspirators
[SHK] Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
[SHK] Peace ho Hear Antony Most noble Antony
[SHK] Why friends you go to do you know not what
[SHK] Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
[SHK] Alas you know not I must tell you then
[SHK] You have forgot the will I told you of
[SHK] Most true The will Let 's stay and hear the will
[SHK] Here is the will and under Caesar 's seal
[SHK] To every Roman citizen he gives
[SHK] To every several man seventy-five drachmas
[SHK] Most noble Caesar We 'll revenge his death
[SHK] O royal Caesar
[SHK] Hear me with patience
[SHK] Peace ho
[SHK] Moreover he hath left you all his walks
[SHK] His private arbours and new-planted orchards
[SHK] On this side Tiber he hath left them you
[SHK] And to your heirs for ever common pleasures
[SHK] To walk abroad and recreate yourselves
[SHK] Here was a Caesar when comes such another
[SHK] Never never Come away away
[SHK] We 'll burn his body in the holy place
[SHK] And with the brands fire the traitors houses
[SHK] Take up the body
[SHK] Go fetch fire
[SHK] Pluck down benches
[SHK] Pluck down forms windows any thing
[SHK] Now let it work Mischief thou art afoot
[SHK] Take thou what course thou wilt
[SHK] How now fellow
[SHK] Sir Octavius is already come to Rome
[SHK] Where is he
[SHK] He and Lepidus are at Caesar 's house
[SHK] And thither will I straight to visit him
[SHK] He comes upon a wish Fortune is merry
[SHK] And in this mood will give us any thing
[SHK] I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
[SHK] Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome
[SHK] Belike they had some notice of the people
[SHK] How I had moved them Bring me to Octavius
[SHK] I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar
[SHK] And things unlucky charge my fantasy
[SHK] I have no will to wander forth of doors
[SHK] Yet something leads me forth
[SHK] What is your name
[SHK] Whither are you going
[SHK] Where do you dwell
[SHK] Are you a married man or a bachelor
[SHK] Answer every man directly
[SHK] Ay and briefly
[SHK] Ay and wisely
[SHK] Ay and truly you were best
[SHK] What is my name Whither am I going Where do I
[SHK] dwell Am I a married man or a bachelor Then to
[SHK] answer every man directly and briefly wisely and
[SHK] truly wisely I say I am a bachelor
[SHK] That 's as much as to say they are fools that marry
[SHK] you 'll bear me a bang for that I fear Proceed directly
[SHK] Directly I am going to Caesar 's funeral
[SHK] As a friend or an enemy
[SHK] As a friend
[SHK] That matter is answered directly
[SHK] For your dwelling -- briefly
[SHK] Briefly I dwell by the Capitol
[SHK] Your name sir truly
[SHK] Truly my name is Cinna
[SHK] Tear him to pieces he 's a conspirator
[SHK] I am Cinna the poet I am Cinna the poet
[SHK] Tear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad verses
[SHK] I am not Cinna the conspirator
[SHK] It is no matter his name 's Cinna pluck but his
[SHK] name out of his heart and turn him going
[SHK] Tear him tear him Come brands ho fire-brands
[SHK] to Brutus to Cassius burn all some to Decius
[SHK] house and some to Casca 's some to Ligarius away go
[SHK] These many then shall die their names are prick 'd
[SHK] Your brother too must die consent you Lepidus
[SHK] I do consent --
[SHK] Prick him down Antony
[SHK] Upon condition Publius shall not live
[SHK] Who is your sister 's son Mark Antony
[SHK] He shall not live look with a spot I damn him
[SHK] But Lepidus go you to Caesar 's house
[SHK] Fetch the will hither and we shall determine
[SHK] How to cut off some charge in legacies
[SHK] What shall I find you here
[SHK] Or here or at the Capitol
[SHK] This is a slight unmeritable man
[SHK] Meet to be sent on errands is it fit
[SHK] The three-fold world divided he should stand
[SHK] One of the three to share it
[SHK] So you thought him
[SHK] And took his voice who should be prick 'd to die
[SHK] In our black sentence and proscription
[SHK] Octavius I have seen more days than you
[SHK] And though we lay these honours on this man
[SHK] To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
[SHK] He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
[SHK] To groan and sweat under the business
[SHK] Either led or driven as we point the way
[SHK] And having brought our treasure where we will
[SHK] Then take we down his load and turn him off
[SHK] Like to the empty ass to shake his ears
[SHK] And graze in commons
[SHK] You may do your will
[SHK] But he 's a tried and valiant soldier
[SHK] So is my horse Octavius and for that
[SHK] I do appoint him store of provender
[SHK] It is a creature that I teach to fight
[SHK] To wind to stop to run directly on
[SHK] His corporal motion govern 'd by my spirit
[SHK] And in some taste is Lepidus but so
[SHK] He must be taught and train 'd and bid go forth
[SHK] A barren-spirited fellow one that feeds
[SHK] On abjects orts and imitations
[SHK] Which out of use and staled by other men
[SHK] Begin his fashion do not talk of him
[SHK] But as a property And now Octavius
[SHK] Listen great things -- Brutus and Cassius
[SHK] Are levying powers we must straight make head
[SHK] Therefore let our alliance be combined
[SHK] Our best friends made our means stretch 'd
[SHK] And let us presently go sit in council
[SHK] How covert matters may be best disclosed
[SHK] And open perils surest answered
[SHK] Let us do so for we are at the stake
[SHK] And bay 'd about with many enemies
[SHK] And some that smile have in their hearts I fear
[SHK] Millions of mischiefs
[SHK] Stand ho
[SHK] Give the word ho and stand
[SHK] What now Lucilius is Cassius near
[SHK] He is at hand and Pindarus is come
[SHK] To do you salutation from his master
[SHK] He greets me well Your master Pindarus
[SHK] In his own change or by ill officers
[SHK] Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
[SHK] Things done undone but if he be at hand
[SHK] I shall be satisfied
[SHK] I do not doubt
[SHK] But that my noble master will appear
[SHK] Such as he is full of regard and honour
[SHK] He is not doubted A word Lucilius
[SHK] How he received you let me be resolved
[SHK] With courtesy and with respect enough
[SHK] But not with such familiar instances
[SHK] Nor with such free and friendly conference
[SHK] As he hath used of old
[SHK] Thou hast described
[SHK] A hot friend cooling ever note Lucilius
[SHK] When love begins to sicken and decay
[SHK] It useth an enforced ceremony
[SHK] There are no tricks in plain and simple faith
[SHK] But hollow men like horses hot at hand
[SHK] Make gallant show and promise of their mettle
[SHK] But when they should endure the bloody spur
[SHK] They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
[SHK] Sink in the trial Comes his army on
[SHK] They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter 'd
[SHK] The greater part the horse in general
[SHK] Are come with Cassius
[SHK] Hark he is arrived
[SHK] March gently on to meet him
[SHK] Stand ho
[SHK] Stand ho Speak the word along
[SHK] Stand
[SHK] Stand
[SHK] Stand
[SHK] Most noble brother you have done me wrong
[SHK] Judge me you gods wrong I mine enemies
[SHK] And if not so how should I wrong a brother
[SHK] Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
[SHK] And when you do them --
[SHK] Cassius be content
[SHK] Speak your griefs softly I do know you well
[SHK] Before the eyes of both our armies here
[SHK] Which should perceive nothing but love from us
[SHK] Let us not wrangle bid them move away
[SHK] Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
[SHK] And I will give you audience
[SHK] Pindarus
[SHK] Bid our commanders lead their charges off
[SHK] A little from this ground
[SHK] Lucilius do you the like and let no man
[SHK] Come to our tent till we have done our conference
[SHK] Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door
[SHK] That you have wrong 'd me doth appear in this
[SHK] You have condemn 'd and noted Lucius Pella
[SHK] For taking bribes here of the Sardians
[SHK] Wherein my letters praying on his side
[SHK] Because I knew the man were slighted off
[SHK] You wronged yourself to write in such a case
[SHK] In such a time as this it is not meet
[SHK] That every nice offence should bear his comment
[SHK] Let me tell you Cassius you yourself
[SHK] Are much condemn 'd to have an itching palm
[SHK] To sell and mart your offices for gold
[SHK] To undeservers
[SHK] I an itching palm
[SHK] You know that you are Brutus that speak this
[SHK] Or by the gods this speech were else your last
[SHK] The name of Cassius honours this corruption
[SHK] And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
[SHK] Chastisement
[SHK] Remember March the ides of March remember
[SHK] Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake
[SHK] What villain touch 'd his body that did stab
[SHK] And not for justice What shall one of us
[SHK] That struck the foremost man of all this world
[SHK] But for supporting robbers shall we now
[SHK] Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
[SHK] And sell the mighty space of our large honours
[SHK] For so much trash as may be grasped thus
[SHK] I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
[SHK] Than such a Roman
[SHK] Brutus bay not me
[SHK] I 'll not endure it you forget yourself
[SHK] To hedge me in I am a soldier I
[SHK] Older in practise abler than yourself
[SHK] To make conditions
[SHK] Go to you are not Cassius
[SHK] I am
[SHK] I say you are not
[SHK] Urge me no more I shall forget myself
[SHK] Have mind upon your health tempt me no further
[SHK] Away slight man
[SHK] Is't possible
[SHK] Hear me for I will speak
[SHK] Must I give way and room to your rash choler
[SHK] Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
[SHK] O ye gods ye gods must I endure all this
[SHK] All this ay more fret till your proud heart break
[SHK] Go show your slaves how choleric you are
[SHK] And make your bondmen tremble Must I budge
[SHK] Must I observe you must I stand and crouch
[SHK] Under your testy humour By the gods
[SHK] You shall digest the venom of your spleen
[SHK] Though it do split you for from this day forth
[SHK] I 'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
[SHK] When you are waspish
[SHK] Is it come to this
[SHK] You say you are a better soldier
[SHK] Let it appear so make your vaunting true
[SHK] And it shall please me well for mine own part
[SHK] I shall be glad to learn of noble men
[SHK] You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
[SHK] I said an elder soldier not a better
[SHK] Did I say 'better
[SHK] If you did I care not
[SHK] When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
[SHK] Peace peace you durst not so have tempted him
[SHK] I durst not
[SHK] No
[SHK] What durst not tempt him
[SHK] For your life you durst not
[SHK] Do not presume too much upon my love
[SHK] I may do that I shall be sorry for
[SHK] You have done that you should be sorry for
[SHK] There is no terror Cassius in your threats
[SHK] For I am arm 'd so strong in honesty
[SHK] That they pass by me as the idle wind
[SHK] Which I respect not I did send to you
[SHK] For certain sums of gold which you denied me
[SHK] For I can raise no money by vile means
[SHK] By heaven I had rather coin my heart
[SHK] And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
[SHK] From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
[SHK] By any indirection I did send
[SHK] To you for gold to pay my legions
[SHK] Which you denied me was that done like Cassius
[SHK] Should I have answer 'd Caius Cassius so
[SHK] When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
[SHK] To lock such rascal counters from his friends
[SHK] Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
[SHK] Dash him to pieces
[SHK] I denied you not
[SHK] You did
[SHK] I did not he was but a fool that brought
[SHK] My answer back Brutus hath rived my heart
[SHK] A friend should bear his friend 's infirmities
[SHK] But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
[SHK] I do not till you practise them on me
[SHK] You love me not
[SHK] I do not like your faults
[SHK] A friendly eye could never see such faults
[SHK] A flatterer 's would not though they do appear
[SHK] As huge as high Olympus
[SHK] Come Antony and young Octavius come
[SHK] Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius
[SHK] For Cassius is aweary of the world
[SHK] Hated by one he loves braved by his brother
[SHK] Cheque 'd like a bondman all his faults observed
[SHK] Set in a note-book learn 'd and conn 'd by rote
[SHK] To cast into my teeth O I could weep
[SHK] My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger
[SHK] And here my naked breast within a heart
[SHK] Dearer than Plutus mine richer than gold
[SHK] If that thou be'st a Roman take it forth
[SHK] I that denied thee gold will give my heart
[SHK] Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know
[SHK] When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
[SHK] Than ever thou lovedst Cassius
[SHK] Sheathe your dagger
[SHK] Be angry when you will it shall have scope
[SHK] Do what you will dishonour shall be humour
[SHK] O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb
[SHK] That carries anger as the flint bears fire
[SHK] Who much enforced shows a hasty spark
[SHK] And straight is cold again
[SHK] Hath Cassius lived
[SHK] To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
[SHK] When grief and blood ill-temper 'd vexeth him
[SHK] When I spoke that I was ill-temper 'd too
[SHK] Do you confess so much Give me your hand
[SHK] And my heart too
[SHK] O Brutus
[SHK] What 's the matter
[SHK] Have not you love enough to bear with me
[SHK] When that rash humour which my mother gave me
[SHK] Makes me forgetful
[SHK] Yes Cassius and from henceforth
[SHK] When you are over-earnest with your Brutus
[SHK] He 'll think your mother chides and leave you so
[SHK] There is some grudge between 'em 't is not meet
[SHK] They be alone
[SHK] How now what 's the matter
[SHK] For shame you generals what do you mean
[SHK] Love and be friends as two such men should be
[SHK] For I have seen more years I 'm sure than ye
[SHK] Ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
[SHK] Get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
[SHK] Bear with him Brutus 't is his fashion
[SHK] I 'll know his humour when he knows his time
[SHK] What should the wars do with these jigging fools
[SHK] Companion hence
[SHK] Away away be gone
[SHK] Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders
[SHK] Prepare to lodge their companies to-night
[SHK] And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
[SHK] Immediately to us
[SHK] Lucius a bowl of wine
[SHK] I did not think you could have been so angry
[SHK] O Cassius I am sick of many griefs
[SHK] Of your philosophy you make no use
[SHK] If you give place to accidental evils
[SHK] No man bears sorrow better Portia is dead
[SHK] Ha Portia
[SHK] She is dead
[SHK] How 'scaped I killing when I cross 'd you so
[SHK] O insupportable and touching loss
[SHK] Upon what sickness
[SHK] Impatient of my absence
[SHK] And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
[SHK] Have made themselves so strong -- for with her death
[SHK] That tidings came -- with this she fell distract
[SHK] And her attendants absent swallow 'd fire
[SHK] And died so
[SHK] Even so
[SHK] O ye immortal gods
[SHK] Speak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine
[SHK] In this I bury all unkindness Cassius
[SHK] My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
[SHK] Fill Lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup
[SHK] I can not drink too much of Brutus love
[SHK] Come in Titinius
[SHK] Welcome good Messala
[SHK] Now sit we close about this taper here
[SHK] And call in question our necessities
[SHK] Portia art thou gone
[SHK] No more I pray you
[SHK] Messala I have here received letters
[SHK] That young Octavius and Mark Antony
[SHK] Come down upon us with a mighty power
[SHK] Bending their expedition toward Philippi
[SHK] Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor
[SHK] With what addition
[SHK] That by proscription and bills of outlawry
[SHK] Octavius Antony and Lepidus
[SHK] Have put to death an hundred senators
[SHK] Therein our letters do not well agree
[SHK] Mine speak of seventy senators that died
[SHK] By their proscriptions Cicero being one
[SHK] Cicero one
[SHK] Cicero is dead
[SHK] And by that order of proscription
[SHK] Had you your letters from your wife my lord
[SHK] No Messala
[SHK] Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
[SHK] Nothing Messala
[SHK] That methinks is strange
[SHK] Why ask you hear you aught of her in yours
[SHK] No my lord
[SHK] Now as you are a Roman tell me true
[SHK] Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
[SHK] For certain she is dead and by strange manner
[SHK] Why farewell Portia We must die Messala
[SHK] With meditating that she must die once
[SHK] I have the patience to endure it now
[SHK] Even so great men great losses should endure
[SHK] I have as much of this in art as you
[SHK] But yet my nature could not bear it so
[SHK] Well to our work alive What do you think
[SHK] Of marching to Philippi presently
[SHK] I do not think it good
[SHK] Your reason
[SHK] This it is
[SHK] 'T is better that the enemy seek us
[SHK] So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
[SHK] Doing himself offence whilst we lying still
[SHK] Are full of rest defense and nimbleness
[SHK] Good reasons must of force give place to better
[SHK] The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
[SHK] Do stand but in a forced affection
[SHK] For they have grudged us contribution
[SHK] The enemy marching along by them
[SHK] By them shall make a fuller number up
[SHK] Come on refresh 'd new-added and encouraged
[SHK] From which advantage shall we cut him off
[SHK] If at Philippi we do face him there
[SHK] These people at our back
[SHK] Hear me good brother
[SHK] Under your pardon You must note beside
[SHK] That we have tried the utmost of our friends
[SHK] Our legions are brim-full our cause is ripe
[SHK] The enemy increaseth every day
[SHK] We at the height are ready to decline
[SHK] There is a tide in the affairs of men
[SHK] Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
[SHK] Omitted all the voyage of their life
[SHK] Is bound in shallows and in miseries
[SHK] On such a full sea are we now afloat
[SHK] And we must take the current when it serves
[SHK] Or lose our ventures
[SHK] Then with your will go on
[SHK] We 'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi
[SHK] The deep of night is crept upon our talk
[SHK] And nature must obey necessity
[SHK] Which we will niggard with a little rest
[SHK] There is no more to say
[SHK] No more Good night
[SHK] Early to-morrow will we rise and hence
[SHK] Lucius
[SHK] My gown
[SHK] Farewell good Messala
[SHK] Good night Titinius Noble noble Cassius
[SHK] Good night and good repose
[SHK] O my dear brother
[SHK] This was an ill beginning of the night
[SHK] Never come such division 'tween our souls
[SHK] Let it not Brutus
[SHK] Every thing is well
[SHK] Good night my lord
[SHK] Good night good brother
[SHK] Good night Lord Brutus
[SHK] Farewell every one
[SHK] Give me the gown Where is thy instrument
[SHK] Here in the tent
[SHK] What thou speak'st drowsily
[SHK] Poor knave I blame thee not thou art o'er-watch 'd
[SHK] Call Claudius and some other of my men
[SHK] I 'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent
[SHK] Varro and Claudius
[SHK] Calls my lord
[SHK] I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep
[SHK] It may be I shall raise you by and by
[SHK] On business to my brother Cassius
[SHK] So please you we will stand and watch your pleasure
[SHK] I will not have it so lie down good sirs
[SHK] It may be I shall otherwise bethink me
[SHK] Look Lucius here 's the book I sought for so
[SHK] I put it in the pocket of my gown
[SHK] I was sure your lordship did not give it me
[SHK] Bear with me good boy I am much forgetful
[SHK] Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile
[SHK] And touch thy instrument a strain or two
[SHK] Ay my lord a n't please you
[SHK] It does my boy
[SHK] I trouble thee too much but thou art willing
[SHK] It is my duty sir
[SHK] I should not urge thy duty past thy might
[SHK] I know young bloods look for a time of rest
[SHK] I have slept my lord already
[SHK] It was well done and thou shalt sleep again
[SHK] I will not hold thee long if I do live
[SHK] I will be good to thee
[SHK] This is a sleepy tune O murderous slumber
[SHK] Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
[SHK] That plays thee music Gentle knave good night
[SHK] I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee
[SHK] If thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument
[SHK] I 'll take it from thee and good boy good night
[SHK] Let me see let me see is not the leaf turn 'd down
[SHK] Where I left reading Here it is I think
[SHK] How ill this taper burns Ha who comes here
[SHK] I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
[SHK] That shapes this monstrous apparition
[SHK] It comes upon me Art thou any thing
[SHK] Art thou some god some angel or some devil
[SHK] That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare
[SHK] Speak to me what thou art
[SHK] Thy evil spirit Brutus
[SHK] Why comest thou
[SHK] To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
[SHK] Well then I shall see thee again
[SHK] Ay at Philippi
[SHK] Why I will see thee at Philippi then
[SHK] Now I have taken heart thou vanishest
[SHK] Ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee
[SHK] Boy Lucius Varro Claudius Sirs awake Claudius
[SHK] The strings my lord are false
[SHK] He thinks he still is at his instrument
[SHK] Lucius awake
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] Didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out
[SHK] My lord I do not know that I did cry
[SHK] Yes that thou didst didst thou see any thing
[SHK] Nothing my lord
[SHK] Sleep again Lucius Sirrah Claudius
[SHK] Fellow thou awake
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep
[SHK] Did we my lord
[SHK] Ay saw you any thing
[SHK] No my lord I saw nothing
[SHK] Nor I my lord
[SHK] Go and commend me to my brother Cassius
[SHK] Bid him set on his powers betimes before
[SHK] And we will follow
[SHK] It shall be done my lord
[SHK] Now Antony our hopes are answered
[SHK] You said the enemy would not come down
[SHK] But keep the hills and upper regions
[SHK] It proves not so their battles are at hand
[SHK] They mean to warn us at Philippi here
[SHK] Answering before we do demand of them
[SHK] Tut I am in their bosoms and I know
[SHK] Wherefore they do it they could be content
[SHK] To visit other places and come down
[SHK] With fearful bravery thinking by this face
[SHK] To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
[SHK] But 't is not so
[SHK] Prepare you generals
[SHK] The enemy comes on in gallant show
[SHK] Their bloody sign of battle is hung out
[SHK] And something to be done immediately
[SHK] Octavius lead your battle softly on
[SHK] Upon the left hand of the even field
[SHK] Upon the right hand I keep thou the left
[SHK] Why do you cross me in this exigent
[SHK] I do not cross you but I will do so
[SHK] They stand and would have parley
[SHK] Stand fast Titinius we must out and talk
[SHK] Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
[SHK] No Caesar we will answer on their charge
[SHK] Make forth the generals would have some words
[SHK] Stir not until the signal
[SHK] Words before blows is it so countrymen
[SHK] Not that we love words better as you do
[SHK] Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
[SHK] In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
[SHK] Witness the hole you made in Caesar 's heart
[SHK] Crying 'Long live hail Caesar
[SHK] Antony
[SHK] The posture of your blows are yet unknown
[SHK] But for your words they rob the Hybla bees
[SHK] And leave them honeyless
[SHK] Not stingless too
[SHK] O yes and soundless too
[SHK] For you have stol'n their buzzing Antony
[SHK] And very wisely threat before you sting
[SHK] Villains you did not so when your vile daggers
[SHK] Hack 'd one another in the sides of Caesar
[SHK] You show 'd your teeth like apes and fawn 'd like hounds
[SHK] And bow 'd like bondmen kissing Caesar 's feet
[SHK] Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind
[SHK] Struck Caesar on the neck O you flatterers
[SHK] Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
[SHK] This tongue had not offended so to-day
[SHK] If Cassius might have ruled
[SHK] Come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
[SHK] The proof of it will turn to redder drops Look
[SHK] I draw a sword against conspirators
[SHK] When think you that the sword goes up again
[SHK] Never till Caesar 's three and thirty wounds
[SHK] Be well avenged or till another Caesar
[SHK] Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
[SHK] Caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
[SHK] Unless thou bring'st them with thee
[SHK] So I hope
[SHK] I was not born to die on Brutus sword
[SHK] O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
[SHK] Young man thou couldst not die more honourable
[SHK] A peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour
[SHK] Join 'd with a masker and a reveller
[SHK] Old Cassius still
[SHK] Come Antony away
[SHK] Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
[SHK] If you dare fight to-day come to the field
[SHK] If not when you have stomachs
[SHK] Why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
[SHK] The storm is up and all is on the hazard
[SHK] Ho Lucilius hark a word with you
[SHK] Messala
[SHK] Messala
[SHK] This is my birth-day as this very day
[SHK] Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
[SHK] Be thou my witness that against my will
[SHK] As Pompey was am I compell 'd to set
[SHK] Upon one battle all our liberties
[SHK] You know that I held Epicurus strong
[SHK] And his opinion now I change my mind
[SHK] And partly credit things that do presage
[SHK] Coming from Sardis on our former ensign
[SHK] Two mighty eagles fell and there they perch 'd
[SHK] Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
[SHK] Who to Philippi here consorted us
[SHK] This morning are they fled away and gone
[SHK] And in their steads do ravens crows and kites
[SHK] Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us
[SHK] As we were sickly prey their shadows seem
[SHK] A canopy most fatal under which
[SHK] Our army lies ready to give up the ghost
[SHK] Believe not so
[SHK] I but believe it partly
[SHK] For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
[SHK] To meet all perils very constantly
[SHK] Even so Lucilius
[SHK] Now most noble Brutus
[SHK] The gods to-day stand friendly that we may
[SHK] Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
[SHK] But since the affairs of men rest still incertain
[SHK] Let 's reason with the worst that may befall
[SHK] If we do lose this battle then is this
[SHK] The very last time we shall speak together
[SHK] What are you then determined to do
[SHK] Even by the rule of that philosophy
[SHK] By which I did blame Cato for the death
[SHK] Which he did give himself I know not how
[SHK] But I do find it cowardly and vile
[SHK] For fear of what might fall so to prevent
[SHK] The time of life arming myself with patience
[SHK] To stay the providence of some high powers
[SHK] That govern us below
[SHK] Then if we lose this battle
[SHK] You are contented to be led in triumph
[SHK] Thorough the streets of Rome
[SHK] No Cassius no think not thou noble Roman
[SHK] That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
[SHK] He bears too great a mind But this same day
[SHK] Must end that work the ides of March begun
[SHK] And whether we shall meet again I know not
[SHK] Therefore our everlasting farewell take
[SHK] For ever and for ever farewell Cassius
[SHK] If we do meet again why we shall smile
[SHK] If not why then this parting was well made
[SHK] For ever and for ever farewell Brutus
[SHK] If we do meet again we 'll smile indeed
[SHK] If not 't is true this parting was well made
[SHK] Why then lead on O that a man might know
[SHK] The end of this day 's business ere it come
[SHK] But it sufficeth that the day will end
[SHK] And then the end is known Come ho away
[SHK] Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills
[SHK] Unto the legions on the other side
[SHK] Let them set on at once for I perceive
[SHK] But cold demeanor in Octavius wing
[SHK] And sudden push gives them the overthrow
[SHK] Ride ride Messala let them all come down
[SHK] O look Titinius look the villains fly
[SHK] Myself have to mine own turn 'd enemy
[SHK] This ensign here of mine was turning back
[SHK] I slew the coward and did take it from him
[SHK] O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
[SHK] Who having some advantage on Octavius
[SHK] Took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
[SHK] Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed
[SHK] Fly further off my lord fly further off
[SHK] Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
[SHK] Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off
[SHK] This hill is far enough Look look Titinius
[SHK] Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
[SHK] They are my lord
[SHK] Titinius if thou lovest me
[SHK] Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
[SHK] Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
[SHK] And here again that I may rest assured
[SHK] Whether yond troops are friend or enemy
[SHK] I will be here again even with a thought
[SHK] Go Pindarus get higher on that hill
[SHK] My sight was ever thick regard Titinius
[SHK] And tell me what thou notest about the field
[SHK] This day I breathed first time is come round
[SHK] And where I did begin there shall I end
[SHK] My life is run his compass Sirrah what news
[SHK] What news
[SHK] With horsemen that make to him on the spur
[SHK] Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him
[SHK] Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too
[SHK] He 's ta'en
[SHK] And hark they shout for joy
[SHK] Come down behold no more
[SHK] O coward that I am to live so long
[SHK] To see my best friend ta'en before my face
[SHK] Come hither sirrah
[SHK] In Parthia did I take thee prisoner
[SHK] And then I swore thee saving of thy life
[SHK] That whatsoever I did bid thee do
[SHK] Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath
[SHK] Now be a freeman and with this good sword
[SHK] That ran through Caesar 's bowels search this bosom
[SHK] Stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
[SHK] And when my face is cover 'd as 't is now
[SHK] Guide thou the sword
[SHK] Caesar thou art revenged
[SHK] Even with the sword that kill 'd thee
[SHK] So I am free yet would not so have been
[SHK] Durst I have done my will O Cassius
[SHK] Far from this country Pindarus shall run
[SHK] Where never Roman shall take note of him
[SHK] It is but change Titinius for Octavius
[SHK] Is overthrown by noble Brutus power
[SHK] As Cassius legions are by Antony
[SHK] These tidings will well comfort Cassius
[SHK] Where did you leave him
[SHK] All disconsolate
[SHK] With Pindarus his bondman on this hill
[SHK] Is not that he that lies upon the ground
[SHK] He lies not like the living O my heart
[SHK] Is not that he
[SHK] No this was he Messala
[SHK] But Cassius is no more O setting sun
[SHK] As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night
[SHK] So in his red blood Cassius day is set
[SHK] The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone
[SHK] Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
[SHK] Mistrust of my success hath done this deed
[SHK] Mistrust of good success hath done this deed
[SHK] O hateful error melancholy 's child
[SHK] Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
[SHK] The things that are not O error soon conceived
[SHK] Thou never comest unto a happy birth
[SHK] But kill'st the mother that engender 'd thee
[SHK] What Pindarus where art thou Pindarus
[SHK] Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet
[SHK] The noble Brutus thrusting this report
[SHK] Into his ears I may say thrusting it
[SHK] For piercing steel and darts envenomed
[SHK] Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
[SHK] As tidings of this sight
[SHK] Hie you Messala
[SHK] And I will seek for Pindarus the while
[SHK] Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
[SHK] Did I not meet thy friends and did not they
[SHK] Put on my brows this wreath of victory
[SHK] And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts
[SHK] Alas thou hast misconstrued every thing
[SHK] But hold thee take this garland on thy brow
[SHK] Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I
[SHK] Will do his bidding Brutus come apace
[SHK] And see how I regarded Caius Cassius
[SHK] By your leave gods -- this is a Roman 's part
[SHK] Come Cassius sword and find Titinius heart
[SHK] Where where Messala doth his body lie
[SHK] Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it
[SHK] Titinius face is upward
[SHK] He is slain
[SHK] O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet
[SHK] Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
[SHK] In our own proper entrails
[SHK] Brave Titinius
[SHK] Look whether he have not crown 'd dead Cassius
[SHK] Are yet two Romans living such as these
[SHK] The last of all the Romans fare thee well
[SHK] It is impossible that ever Rome
[SHK] Should breed thy fellow Friends I owe more tears
[SHK] To this dead man than you shall see me pay
[SHK] I shall find time Cassius I shall find time
[SHK] Come therefore and to Thasos send his body
[SHK] His funerals shall not be in our camp
[SHK] Lest it discomfort us Lucilius come
[SHK] And come young Cato let us to the field
[SHK] Labeo and Flavius set our battles on
[SHK] 'T is three o'clock and Romans yet ere night
[SHK] We shall try fortune in a second fight
[SHK] Yet countrymen O yet hold up your heads
[SHK] What bastard doth not Who will go with me
[SHK] I will proclaim my name about the field
[SHK] I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
[SHK] A foe to tyrants and my country 's friend
[SHK] I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
[SHK] And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I
[SHK] Brutus my country 's friend know me for Brutus
[SHK] O young and noble Cato art thou down
[SHK] Why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius
[SHK] And mayst be honour 'd being Cato 's son
[SHK] Yield or thou diest
[SHK] Only I yield to die
[SHK] There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight
[SHK] Kill Brutus and be honour 'd in his death
[SHK] We must not A noble prisoner
[SHK] Room ho Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en
[SHK] I 'll tell the news Here comes the general
[SHK] Brutus is ta'en Brutus is ta'en my lord
[SHK] Where is he
[SHK] Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough
[SHK] I dare assure thee that no enemy
[SHK] Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus
[SHK] The gods defend him from so great a shame
[SHK] When you do find him or alive or dead
[SHK] He will be found like Brutus like himself
[SHK] This is not Brutus friend but I assure you
[SHK] A prize no less in worth keep this man safe
[SHK] Give him all kindness I had rather have
[SHK] Such men my friends than enemies Go on
[SHK] And see whether Brutus be alive or dead
[SHK] And bring us word unto Octavius tent
[SHK] How every thing is chanced
[SHK] Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
[SHK] Statilius show 'd the torch-light but my lord
[SHK] He came not back he is or ta'en or slain
[SHK] Sit thee down Clitus slaying is the word
[SHK] It is a deed in fashion Hark thee Clitus
[SHK] What I my lord No not for all the world
[SHK] Peace then no words
[SHK] I 'll rather kill myself
[SHK] Hark thee Dardanius
[SHK] Shall I do such a deed
[SHK] O Dardanius
[SHK] O Clitus
[SHK] What ill request did Brutus make to thee
[SHK] To kill him Clitus Look he meditates
[SHK] Now is that noble vessel full of grief
[SHK] That it runs over even at his eyes
[SHK] Come hither good Volumnius list a word
[SHK] What says my lord
[SHK] Why this Volumnius
[SHK] The ghost of Caesar hath appear 'd to me
[SHK] Two several times by night at Sardis once
[SHK] And this last night here in Philippi fields
[SHK] I know my hour is come
[SHK] Not so my lord
[SHK] Nay I am sure it is Volumnius
[SHK] Thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes
[SHK] Our enemies have beat us to the pit
[SHK] It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
[SHK] Than tarry till they push us Good Volumnius
[SHK] Thou know'st that we two went to school together
[SHK] Even for that our love of old I prithee
[SHK] Hold thou my sword-hilts whilst I run on it
[SHK] That 's not an office for a friend my lord
[SHK] Fly fly my lord there is no tarrying here

[SHK] I found no man but he was true to me
[SHK] I shall have glory by this losing day
[SHK] More than Octavius and Mark Antony
[SHK] By this vile conquest shall attain unto
[SHK] So fare you well at once for Brutus tongue

[SHK] Night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest

[SHK] I prithee Strato stay thou by thy lord
[SHK] Thou art a fellow of a good respect
[SHK] Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it
[SHK] Hold then my sword and turn away thy face
[SHK] While I do run upon it Wilt thou Strato
[SHK] Give me your hand first Fare you well my lord
[SHK] Farewell good Strato
[SHK] Caesar now be still
[SHK] I kill 'd not thee with half so good a will
[SHK] What man is that
[SHK] My master 's man Strato where is thy master
[SHK] Free from the bondage you are in Messala
[SHK] The conquerors can but make a fire of him
[SHK] For Brutus only overcame himself
[SHK] And no man else hath honour by his death
[SHK] So Brutus should be found I thank thee Brutus
[SHK] That thou hast proved Lucilius saying true
[SHK] All that served Brutus I will entertain them
[SHK] Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
[SHK] Ay if Messala will prefer me to you
[SHK] Do so good Messala
[SHK] How died my master Strato
[SHK] I held the sword and he did run on it
[SHK] Octavius then take him to follow thee
[SHK] That did the latest service to my master
[SHK] This was the noblest Roman of them all
[SHK] All the conspirators save only he
[SHK] Did that they did in envy of great Caesar
[SHK] He only in a general honest thought
[SHK] And common good to all made one of them
[SHK] His life was gentle and the elements
[SHK] So mix 'd in him that Nature might stand up
[SHK] And say to all the world 'This was a man
[SHK] According to his virtue let us use him
[SHK] With all respect and rites of burial
[SHK] Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie
[SHK] Most like a soldier order 'd honourably
[SHK] So call the field to rest and let 's away
[SHK] To part the glories of this happy day
[SHK] When shall we three meet again
[SHK] In thunder lightning or in rain
[SHK] When the hurlyburly 's done
[SHK] When the battle 's lost and won
[SHK] That will be ere the set of sun
[SHK] Where the place
[SHK] Upon the heath
[SHK] There to meet with Macbeth
[SHK] I come Graymalkin
[SHK] Paddock calls
[SHK] Anon
[SHK] Fair is foul and foul is fair
[SHK] Hover through the fog and filthy air
[SHK] What bloody man is that He can report
[SHK] As seemeth by his plight of the revolt
[SHK] The newest state
[SHK] This is the sergeant
[SHK] Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
[SHK] 'Gainst my captivity Hail brave friend
[SHK] Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
[SHK] As thou didst leave it
[SHK] Doubtful it stood
[SHK] As two spent swimmers that do cling together
[SHK] And choke their art The merciless Macdonwald --
[SHK] Worthy to be a rebel for to that
[SHK] The multiplying villanies of nature
[SHK] Do swarm upon him -- from the western isles
[SHK] Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
[SHK] And fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
[SHK] Show 'd like a rebel 's whore but all 's too weak
[SHK] For brave Macbeth -- well he deserves that name --
[SHK] Disdaining fortune with his brandish 'd steel
[SHK] Which smoked with bloody execution
[SHK] Like valour 's minion carved out his passage
[SHK] Till he faced the slave
[SHK] Which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him
[SHK] Till he unseam 'd him from the nave to the chaps
[SHK] And fix 'd his head upon our battlements
[SHK] O valiant cousin worthy gentleman
[SHK] As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
[SHK] Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
[SHK] So from that spring whence comfort seem 'd to come
[SHK] Discomfort swells Mark king of Scotland mark
[SHK] No sooner justice had with valour arm 'd
[SHK] Compell 'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels
[SHK] But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage
[SHK] With furbish 'd arms and new supplies of men
[SHK] Began a fresh assault
[SHK] Dismay 'd not this
[SHK] Our captains Macbeth and Banquo
[SHK] Yes
[SHK] As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
[SHK] If I say sooth I must report they were
[SHK] As cannons overcharged with double cracks so they
[SHK] Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
[SHK] Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
[SHK] Or memorise another Golgotha
[SHK] I can not tell
[SHK] But I am faint my gashes cry for help
[SHK] So well thy words become thee as thy wounds
[SHK] They smack of honour both Go get him surgeons
[SHK] Who comes here
[SHK] The worthy thane of Ross
[SHK] What a haste looks through his eyes So should he look
[SHK] That seems to speak things strange
[SHK] God save the king
[SHK] Whence camest thou worthy thane
[SHK] From Fife great king
[SHK] Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
[SHK] And fan our people cold Norway himself
[SHK] With terrible numbers
[SHK] Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
[SHK] The thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict
[SHK] Till that Bellona 's bridegroom lapp 'd in proof
[SHK] Confronted him with self-comparisons
[SHK] Point against point rebellious arm 'gainst arm
[SHK] Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
[SHK] The victory fell on us
[SHK] Great happiness
[SHK] That now
[SHK] Sweno the Norways king craves composition
[SHK] Nor would we deign him burial of his men
[SHK] Till he disbursed at Saint Colme 's inch
[SHK] Ten thousand dollars to our general use
[SHK] No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
[SHK] Our bosom interest go pronounce his present death
[SHK] And with his former title greet Macbeth
[SHK] I 'll see it done
[SHK] What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won
[SHK] Where hast thou been sister
[SHK] Killing swine
[SHK] Sister where thou
[SHK] A sailor 's wife had chestnuts in her lap
[SHK] And munch 'd and munch 'd and munch 'd --
[SHK] 'Give me quoth I
[SHK] 'Aroint thee witch the rump-fed ronyon cries
[SHK] Her husband 's to Aleppo gone master o the Tiger
[SHK] But in a sieve I 'll thither sail
[SHK] And like a rat without a tail
[SHK] I 'll do I 'll do and I 'll do
[SHK] I 'll give thee a wind
[SHK] Thou'rt kind
[SHK] And I another
[SHK] I myself have all the other
[SHK] And the very ports they blow
[SHK] All the quarters that they know
[SHK] I the shipman 's card
[SHK] I will drain him dry as hay
[SHK] Sleep shall neither night nor day
[SHK] Hang upon his pent-house lid
[SHK] He shall live a man forbid
[SHK] Weary se'nnights nine times nine
[SHK] Shall he dwindle peak and pine
[SHK] Though his bark can not be lost
[SHK] Yet it shall be tempest-tost
[SHK] Look what I have
[SHK] Show me show me
[SHK] Here I have a pilot 's thumb
[SHK] Wreck 'd as homeward he did come
[SHK] A drum a drum
[SHK] Macbeth doth come
[SHK] The weird sisters hand in hand
[SHK] Posters of the sea and land
[SHK] Thus do go about about
[SHK] Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
[SHK] And thrice again to make up nine
[SHK] Peace the charm 's wound up
[SHK] So foul and fair a day I have not seen
[SHK] How far is't call 'd to Forres What are these
[SHK] So wither 'd and so wild in their attire
[SHK] That look not like the inhabitants o the earth
[SHK] And yet are o n't Live you or are you aught
[SHK] That man may question You seem to understand me
[SHK] By each at once her chappy finger laying
[SHK] Upon her skinny lips you should be women
[SHK] And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
[SHK] That you are so
[SHK] Speak if you can what are you
[SHK] All hail Macbeth hail to thee thane of Glamis
[SHK] All hail Macbeth hail to thee thane of Cawdor
[SHK] All hail Macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter
[SHK] Good sir why do you start and seem to fear
[SHK] Things that do sound so fair I the name of truth
[SHK] Are ye fantastical or that indeed
[SHK] Which outwardly ye show My noble partner
[SHK] You greet with present grace and great prediction
[SHK] Of noble having and of royal hope
[SHK] That he seems rapt withal to me you speak not
[SHK] If you can look into the seeds of time
[SHK] And say which grain will grow and which will not
[SHK] Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
[SHK] Your favours nor your hate
[SHK] Hail
[SHK] Hail
[SHK] Hail
[SHK] Lesser than Macbeth and greater
[SHK] Not so happy yet much happier
[SHK] Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
[SHK] So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
[SHK] Banquo and Macbeth all hail
[SHK] Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
[SHK] By Sinel 's death I know I am thane of Glamis
[SHK] But how of Cawdor the thane of Cawdor lives
[SHK] A prosperous gentleman and to be king
[SHK] Stands not within the prospect of belief
[SHK] No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence
[SHK] You owe this strange intelligence or why
[SHK] Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
[SHK] With such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you
[SHK] The earth hath bubbles as the water has
[SHK] And these are of them Whither are they vanish 'd
[SHK] Into the air and what seem 'd corporal melted
[SHK] As breath into the wind Would they had stay 'd
[SHK] Were such things here as we do speak about
[SHK] Or have we eaten on the insane root
[SHK] That takes the reason prisoner
[SHK] Your children shall be kings
[SHK] You shall be king
[SHK] And thane of Cawdor too went it not so
[SHK] To the selfsame tune and words Who 's here
[SHK] The king hath happily received Macbeth
[SHK] The news of thy success and when he reads
[SHK] Thy personal venture in the rebels fight
[SHK] His wonders and his praises do contend
[SHK] Which should be thine or his silenced with that
[SHK] In viewing o'er the rest o the selfsame day
[SHK] He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks
[SHK] Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
[SHK] Strange images of death As thick as hail
[SHK] Came post with post and every one did bear
[SHK] Thy praises in his kingdom 's great defence
[SHK] And pour 'd them down before him
[SHK] We are sent
[SHK] To give thee from our royal master thanks
[SHK] Only to herald thee into his sight
[SHK] Not pay thee
[SHK] And for an earnest of a greater honour
[SHK] He bade me from him call thee thane of Cawdor
[SHK] In which addition hail most worthy thane
[SHK] For it is thine
[SHK] What can the devil speak true
[SHK] The thane of Cawdor lives why do you dress me
[SHK] In borrow 'd robes
[SHK] Who was the thane lives yet
[SHK] But under heavy judgment bears that life
[SHK] Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined
[SHK] With those of Norway or did line the rebel
[SHK] With hidden help and vantage or that with both
[SHK] He labour 'd in his country 's wreck I know not
[SHK] But treasons capital confess 'd and proved
[SHK] Have overthrown him
[SHK] The greatest is behind
[SHK] Thanks for your pains
[SHK] Do you not hope your children shall be kings
[SHK] When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
[SHK] Promised no less to them
[SHK] That trusted home
[SHK] Might yet enkindle you unto the crown
[SHK] Besides the thane of Cawdor But 't is strange
[SHK] And oftentimes to win us to our harm
[SHK] The instruments of darkness tell us truths
[SHK] Win us with honest trifles to betray 's
[SHK] In deepest consequence
[SHK] Cousins a word I pray you
[SHK] As happy prologues to the swelling act
[SHK] Of the imperial theme. -- I thank you gentlemen
[SHK] Can not be ill can not be good if ill
[SHK] Why hath it given me earnest of success
[SHK] Commencing in a truth I am thane of Cawdor
[SHK] If good why do I yield to that suggestion
[SHK] Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
[SHK] And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
[SHK] Against the use of nature Present fears
[SHK] Are less than horrible imaginings
[SHK] My thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
[SHK] Shakes so my single state of man that function
[SHK] Is smother 'd in surmise and nothing is
[SHK] But what is not
[SHK] Look how our partner 's rapt
[SHK] Without my stir
[SHK] New horrors come upon him
[SHK] Like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
[SHK] But with the aid of use
[SHK] Time and the hour runs through the roughest day
[SHK] Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure
[SHK] Give me your favour my dull brain was wrought
[SHK] With things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains
[SHK] Are register 'd where every day I turn
[SHK] The leaf to read them Let us toward the king
[SHK] Think upon what hath chanced and at more time
[SHK] The interim having weigh 'd it let us speak
[SHK] Our free hearts each to other
[SHK] Very gladly
[SHK] Till then enough Come friends
[SHK] Is execution done on Cawdor Are not
[SHK] Those in commission yet return 'd
[SHK] My liege
[SHK] They are not yet come back But I have spoke
[SHK] With one that saw him die who did report
[SHK] That very frankly he confess 'd his treasons
[SHK] Implored your highness pardon and set forth
[SHK] A deep repentance nothing in his life
[SHK] Became him like the leaving it he died
[SHK] As one that had been studied in his death
[SHK] To throw away the dearest thing he owed
[SHK] As 'twere a careless trifle
[SHK] There 's no art
[SHK] To find the mind 's construction in the face
[SHK] He was a gentleman on whom I built
[SHK] An absolute trust
[SHK] O worthiest cousin
[SHK] The sin of my ingratitude even now
[SHK] Was heavy on me thou art so far before
[SHK] That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
[SHK] To overtake thee Would thou hadst less deserved
[SHK] That the proportion both of thanks and payment
[SHK] Might have been mine only I have left to say
[SHK] More is thy due than more than all can pay
[SHK] The service and the loyalty I owe
[SHK] In doing it pays itself Your highness part
[SHK] Is to receive our duties and our duties
[SHK] Are to your throne and state children and servants
[SHK] Which do but what they should by doing every thing
[SHK] Safe toward your love and honour
[SHK] Welcome hither
[SHK] I have begun to plant thee and will labour
[SHK] To make thee full of growing Noble Banquo
[SHK] That hast no less deserved nor must be known
[SHK] No less to have done so let me enfold thee
[SHK] And hold thee to my heart
[SHK] There if I grow
[SHK] The harvest is your own
[SHK] My plenteous joys
[SHK] Wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves
[SHK] In drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes
[SHK] And you whose places are the nearest know
[SHK] We will establish our estate upon
[SHK] Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter
[SHK] The Prince of Cumberland which honour must
[SHK] Not unaccompanied invest him only
[SHK] But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
[SHK] On all deservers From hence to Inverness
[SHK] And bind us further to you
[SHK] The rest is labour which is not used for you
[SHK] I 'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
[SHK] The hearing of my wife with your approach
[SHK] So humbly take my leave
[SHK] My worthy Cawdor
[SHK] On which I must fall down or else o'erleap
[SHK] For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires
[SHK] Let not light see my black and deep desires
[SHK] The eye wink at the hand yet let that be
[SHK] Which the eye fears when it is done to see
[SHK] True worthy Banquo he is full so valiant
[SHK] And in his commendations I am fed
[SHK] It is a banquet to me Let 's after him
[SHK] Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
[SHK] It is a peerless kinsman
[SHK] 'They met me in the day of success and I have
[SHK] learned by the perfectest report they have more in
[SHK] them than mortal knowledge When I burned in desire
[SHK] to question them further they made themselves air
[SHK] into which they vanished Whiles I stood rapt in
[SHK] the wonder of it came missives from the king who
[SHK] all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor by which title
[SHK] before these weird sisters saluted me and referred
[SHK] me to the coming on of time with 'Hail king that
[SHK] shalt be This have I thought good to deliver
[SHK] thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou
[SHK] mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being
[SHK] ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it
[SHK] to thy heart and farewell
[SHK] Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be
[SHK] What thou art promised yet do I fear thy nature
[SHK] It is too full o the milk of human kindness
[SHK] To catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great
[SHK] Art not without ambition but without
[SHK] The illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly
[SHK] That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
[SHK] And yet wouldst wrongly win thou'ldst have great Glamis
[SHK] That which cries 'Thus thou must do if thou have it
[SHK] And that which rather thou dost fear to do
[SHK] Than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither
[SHK] That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
[SHK] And chastise with the valour of my tongue
[SHK] All that impedes thee from the golden round
[SHK] Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
[SHK] To have thee crown 'd withal
[SHK] What is your tidings
[SHK] The king comes here to-night
[SHK] Thou'rt mad to say it
[SHK] Is not thy master with him who were't so
[SHK] Would have inform 'd for preparation
[SHK] So please you it is true our thane is coming
[SHK] One of my fellows had the speed of him
[SHK] Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
[SHK] Than would make up his message
[SHK] Give him tending
[SHK] He brings great news
[SHK] The raven himself is hoarse
[SHK] That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
[SHK] Under my battlements Come you spirits
[SHK] That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
[SHK] And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
[SHK] Of direst cruelty make thick my blood
[SHK] Stop up the access and passage to remorse
[SHK] That no compunctious visitings of nature
[SHK] Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
[SHK] The effect and it Come to my woman 's breasts
[SHK] And take my milk for gall you murdering ministers
[SHK] Wherever in your sightless substances
[SHK] You wait on nature 's mischief Come thick night
[SHK] And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
[SHK] That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
[SHK] Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
[SHK] To cry 'Hold hold
[SHK] Great Glamis worthy Cawdor
[SHK] Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter
[SHK] Thy letters have transported me beyond
[SHK] This ignorant present and I feel now
[SHK] The future in the instant
[SHK] My dearest love
[SHK] Duncan comes here to-night
[SHK] And when goes hence
[SHK] To-morrow as he purposes
[SHK] O never
[SHK] Shall sun that morrow see
[SHK] Your face my thane is as a book where men
[SHK] May read strange matters To beguile the time
[SHK] Look like the time bear welcome in your eye
[SHK] Your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
[SHK] But be the serpent under't He that 's coming
[SHK] Must be provided for and you shall put
[SHK] This night 's great business into my dispatch
[SHK] Which shall to all our nights and days to come
[SHK] Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom
[SHK] We will speak further
[SHK] Only look up clear
[SHK] To alter favour ever is to fear
[SHK] Leave all the rest to me
[SHK] This castle hath a pleasant seat the air
[SHK] Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
[SHK] Unto our gentle senses
[SHK] This guest of summer
[SHK] The temple-haunting martlet does approve
[SHK] By his loved mansionry that the heaven 's breath
[SHK] Smells wooingly here no jutty frieze
[SHK] Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird
[SHK] Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle
[SHK] Where they most breed and haunt I have observed
[SHK] The air is delicate
[SHK] See see our honour 'd hostess
[SHK] The love that follows us sometime is our trouble
[SHK] Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you
[SHK] How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains
[SHK] And thank us for your trouble
[SHK] All our service
[SHK] In every point twice done and then done double
[SHK] Were poor and single business to contend
[SHK] Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
[SHK] Your majesty loads our house for those of old
[SHK] And the late dignities heap 'd up to them
[SHK] We rest your hermits
[SHK] Where 's the thane of Cawdor
[SHK] We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
[SHK] To be his purveyor but he rides well
[SHK] And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him
[SHK] To his home before us Fair and noble hostess
[SHK] We are your guest to-night
[SHK] Your servants ever
[SHK] Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt
[SHK] To make their audit at your highness pleasure
[SHK] Still to return your own
[SHK] Give me your hand
[SHK] Conduct me to mine host we love him highly
[SHK] And shall continue our graces towards him
[SHK] By your leave hostess
[SHK] If it were done when 't is done then 'twere well
[SHK] It were done quickly if the assassination
[SHK] Could trammel up the consequence and catch
[SHK] With his surcease success that but this blow
[SHK] Might be the be-all and the end-all here
[SHK] But here upon this bank and shoal of time
[SHK] We'ld jump the life to come But in these cases
[SHK] We still have judgment here that we but teach
[SHK] Bloody instructions which being taught return
[SHK] To plague the inventor this even-handed justice
[SHK] Commends the ingredients of our poison 'd chalice
[SHK] To our own lips He 's here in double trust
[SHK] First as I am his kinsman and his subject
[SHK] Strong both against the deed then as his host
[SHK] Who should against his murderer shut the door
[SHK] Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan
[SHK] Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
[SHK] So clear in his great office that his virtues
[SHK] Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
[SHK] The deep damnation of his taking-off
[SHK] And pity like a naked new-born babe
[SHK] Striding the blast or heaven 's cherubim horsed
[SHK] Upon the sightless couriers of the air
[SHK] Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
[SHK] That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur
[SHK] To prick the sides of my intent but only
[SHK] Vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself
[SHK] And falls on the other
[SHK] How now what news
[SHK] He has almost supp 'd why have you left the chamber
[SHK] Hath he ask 'd for me
[SHK] Know you not he has
[SHK] We will proceed no further in this business
[SHK] He hath honour 'd me of late and I have bought
[SHK] Golden opinions from all sorts of people
[SHK] Which would be worn now in their newest gloss
[SHK] Not cast aside so soon
[SHK] Was the hope drunk
[SHK] Wherein you dress 'd yourself hath it slept since
[SHK] And wakes it now to look so green and pale
[SHK] At what it did so freely From this time
[SHK] Such I account thy love Art thou afeard
[SHK] To be the same in thine own act and valour
[SHK] As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
[SHK] Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life
[SHK] And live a coward in thine own esteem
[SHK] Letting I dare not wait upon I would
[SHK] Like the poor cat i the adage
[SHK] Prithee peace
[SHK] I dare do all that may become a man
[SHK] Who dares do more is none
[SHK] What beast was't then
[SHK] That made you break this enterprise to me
[SHK] When you durst do it then you were a man
[SHK] And to be more than what you were you would
[SHK] Be so much more the man Nor time nor place
[SHK] Did then adhere and yet you would make both
[SHK] They have made themselves and that their fitness now
[SHK] Does unmake you I have given suck and know
[SHK] How tender 't is to love the babe that milks me
[SHK] I would while it was smiling in my face
[SHK] Have pluck 'd my nipple from his boneless gums
[SHK] And dash 'd the brains out had I so sworn as you
[SHK] Have done to this
[SHK] If we should fail
[SHK] We fail
[SHK] But screw your courage to the sticking-place
[SHK] And we 'll not fail When Duncan is asleep --
[SHK] Whereto the rather shall his day 's hard journey
[SHK] Soundly invite him -- his two chamberlains
[SHK] Will I with wine and wassail so convince
[SHK] That memory the warder of the brain
[SHK] Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
[SHK] A limbeck only when in swinish sleep
[SHK] Their drenched natures lie as in a death
[SHK] What can not you and I perform upon
[SHK] The unguarded Duncan what not put upon
[SHK] His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
[SHK] Of our great quell
[SHK] Bring forth men-children only
[SHK] For thy undaunted mettle should compose
[SHK] Nothing but males Will it not be received
[SHK] When we have mark 'd with blood those sleepy two
[SHK] Of his own chamber and used their very daggers
[SHK] That they have done't
[SHK] Who dares receive it other
[SHK] As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
[SHK] Upon his death
[SHK] I am settled and bend up
[SHK] Each corporal agent to this terrible feat
[SHK] Away and mock the time with fairest show
[SHK] False face must hide what the false heart doth know
[SHK] How goes the night boy
[SHK] The moon is down I have not heard the clock
[SHK] And she goes down at twelve
[SHK] I take't 't is later sir
[SHK] Hold take my sword There 's husbandry in heaven
[SHK] Their candles are all out Take thee that too
[SHK] A heavy summons lies like lead upon me
[SHK] And yet I would not sleep merciful powers
[SHK] Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
[SHK] Gives way to in repose
[SHK] Give me my sword
[SHK] Who 's there
[SHK] A friend
[SHK] What sir not yet at rest The king 's a-bed
[SHK] He hath been in unusual pleasure and
[SHK] Sent forth great largess to your offices
[SHK] This diamond he greets your wife withal
[SHK] By the name of most kind hostess and shut up
[SHK] In measureless content
[SHK] Being unprepared
[SHK] Our will became the servant to defect
[SHK] Which else should free have wrought
[SHK] All 's well
[SHK] I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
[SHK] To you they have show 'd some truth
[SHK] I think not of them
[SHK] Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
[SHK] We would spend it in some words upon that business
[SHK] If you would grant the time
[SHK] At your kind'st leisure
[SHK] If you shall cleave to my consent when 't is
[SHK] It shall make honour for you
[SHK] So I lose none
[SHK] In seeking to augment it but still keep
[SHK] My bosom franchised and allegiance clear
[SHK] I shall be counsell 'd
[SHK] Good repose the while
[SHK] Thanks sir the like to you
[SHK] Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
[SHK] She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed
[SHK] Is this a dagger which I see before me
[SHK] The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee
[SHK] I have thee not and yet I see thee still
[SHK] Art thou not fatal vision sensible
[SHK] To feeling as to sight or art thou but
[SHK] A dagger of the mind a false creation
[SHK] Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain
[SHK] I see thee yet in form as palpable
[SHK] As this which now I draw
[SHK] Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going
[SHK] And such an instrument I was to use
[SHK] Mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses
[SHK] Or else worth all the rest I see thee still
[SHK] And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
[SHK] Which was not so before There 's no such thing
[SHK] It is the bloody business which informs
[SHK] Thus to mine eyes Now o'er the one halfworld
[SHK] Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
[SHK] The curtain 'd sleep witchcraft celebrates
[SHK] Pale Hecate 's offerings and wither 'd murder
[SHK] Alarum 'd by his sentinel the wolf
[SHK] Whose howl 's his watch thus with his stealthy pace
[SHK] With Tarquin 's ravishing strides towards his design
[SHK] Moves like a ghost Thou sure and firm-set earth
[SHK] Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
[SHK] Thy very stones prate of my whereabout
[SHK] And take the present horror from the time
[SHK] Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives
[SHK] Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
[SHK] I go and it is done the bell invites me
[SHK] Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell
[SHK] That summons thee to heaven or to hell
[SHK] That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
[SHK] What hath quench 'd them hath given me fire
[SHK] Hark Peace
[SHK] It was the owl that shriek 'd the fatal bellman
[SHK] Which gives the stern'st good-night He is about it
[SHK] The doors are open and the surfeited grooms
[SHK] Do mock their charge with snores I have drugg 'd
[SHK] their possets
[SHK] That death and nature do contend about them
[SHK] Whether they live or die
[SHK] Alack I am afraid they have awaked
[SHK] And 't is not done The attempt and not the deed
[SHK] Confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready
[SHK] He could not miss 'em Had he not resembled
[SHK] My father as he slept I had done't
[SHK] My husband
[SHK] I have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noise
[SHK] I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
[SHK] Did not you speak
[SHK] When
[SHK] Now
[SHK] As I descended
[SHK] Ay
[SHK] Hark
[SHK] Who lies i the second chamber
[SHK] Donalbain
[SHK] This is a sorry sight
[SHK] A foolish thought to say a sorry sight
[SHK] There 's one did laugh in 's sleep and one cried
[SHK] 'Murder
[SHK] That they did wake each other I stood and heard them
[SHK] But they did say their prayers and address 'd them
[SHK] Again to sleep
[SHK] There are two lodged together
[SHK] One cried 'God bless us and 'Amen the other
[SHK] As they had seen me with these hangman 's hands
[SHK] Listening their fear I could not say 'Amen
[SHK] When they did say 'God bless us
[SHK] Consider it not so deeply
[SHK] But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen
[SHK] I had most need of blessing and 'Amen
[SHK] Stuck in my throat
[SHK] These deeds must not be thought
[SHK] After these ways so it will make us mad
[SHK] Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more
[SHK] Macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep
[SHK] Sleep that knits up the ravell 'd sleeve of care
[SHK] The death of each day 's life sore labour 's bath
[SHK] Balm of hurt minds great nature 's second course
[SHK] Chief nourisher in life 's feast --
[SHK] What do you mean
[SHK] Still it cried 'Sleep no more to all the house
[SHK] 'Glamis hath murder 'd sleep and therefore Cawdor
[SHK] Shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more
[SHK] Who was it that thus cried Why worthy thane
[SHK] You do unbend your noble strength to think
[SHK] So brainsickly of things Go get some water
[SHK] And wash this filthy witness from your hand
[SHK] Why did you bring these daggers from the place
[SHK] They must lie there go carry them and smear
[SHK] The sleepy grooms with blood
[SHK] I 'll go no more
[SHK] I am afraid to think what I have done
[SHK] Look o n't again I dare not
[SHK] Infirm of purpose
[SHK] Give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead
[SHK] Are but as pictures 't is the eye of childhood
[SHK] That fears a painted devil If he do bleed
[SHK] I 'll gild the faces of the grooms withal
[SHK] For it must seem their guilt
[SHK] Whence is that knocking
[SHK] How is't with me when every noise appals me
[SHK] What hands are here ha they pluck out mine eyes
[SHK] Will all great Neptune 's ocean wash this blood
[SHK] Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather
[SHK] The multitudinous seas in incarnadine
[SHK] Making the green one red
[SHK] My hands are of your colour but I shame
[SHK] To wear a heart so white
[SHK] I hear a knocking
[SHK] At the south entry retire we to our chamber
[SHK] A little water clears us of this deed
[SHK] How easy is it then Your constancy
[SHK] Hath left you unattended
[SHK] Hark more knocking
[SHK] Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us
[SHK] And show us to be watchers Be not lost
[SHK] So poorly in your thoughts
[SHK] To know my deed 'twere best not know myself
[SHK] Wake Duncan with thy knocking I would thou couldst
[SHK] Here 's a knocking indeed If a
[SHK] man were porter of hell-gate he should have
[SHK] old turning the key
[SHK] Knock
[SHK] knock knock Who 's there i the name of
[SHK] Beelzebub Here 's a farmer that hanged
[SHK] himself on the expectation of plenty come in
[SHK] time have napkins enow about you here
[SHK] you 'll sweat for't
[SHK] Knock
[SHK] knock Who 's there in the other devil 's
[SHK] name Faith here 's an equivocator that could
[SHK] swear in both the scales against either scale
[SHK] who committed treason enough for God 's sake
[SHK] yet could not equivocate to heaven O come
[SHK] in equivocator
[SHK] Knock
[SHK] knock knock Who 's there Faith here 's an
[SHK] English tailor come hither for stealing out of
[SHK] a French hose come in tailor here you may
[SHK] roast your goose
[SHK] Knock
[SHK] knock never at quiet What are you But
[SHK] this place is too cold for hell I 'll devil-porter
[SHK] it no further I had thought to have let in
[SHK] some of all professions that go the primrose
[SHK] way to the everlasting bonfire
[SHK] Anon anon I pray you remember the porter
[SHK] Was it so late friend ere you went to bed
[SHK] That you do lie so late
[SHK] 'Faith sir we were carousing till the
[SHK] second cock and drink sir is a great
[SHK] provoker of three things
[SHK] What three things does drink especially provoke
[SHK] Marry sir nose-painting sleep and
[SHK] urine Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes
[SHK] it provokes the desire but it takes
[SHK] away the performance therefore much drink
[SHK] may be said to be an equivocator with lechery
[SHK] it makes him and it mars him it sets
[SHK] him on and it takes him off it persuades him
[SHK] and disheartens him makes him stand to and
[SHK] not stand to in conclusion equivocates him
[SHK] in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
[SHK] I believe drink gave thee the lie last night
[SHK] That it did sir i the very throat on
[SHK] me but I requited him for his lie and I
[SHK] think being too strong for him though he took
[SHK] up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast
[SHK] him
[SHK] Is thy master stirring
[SHK] Our knocking has awaked him here he comes
[SHK] Good morrow noble sir
[SHK] Good morrow both
[SHK] Is the king stirring worthy thane
[SHK] Not yet
[SHK] He did command me to call timely on him
[SHK] I have almost slipp 'd the hour
[SHK] I 'll bring you to him
[SHK] I know this is a joyful trouble to you
[SHK] But yet 't is one
[SHK] The labour we delight in physics pain
[SHK] This is the door
[SHK] I 'll make so bold to call
[SHK] For 't is my limited service
[SHK] Goes the king hence to-day
[SHK] He does he did appoint so
[SHK] The night has been unruly where we lay
[SHK] Our chimneys were blown down and as they say
[SHK] Lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death
[SHK] And prophesying with accents terrible
[SHK] Of dire combustion and confused events
[SHK] New hatch 'd to the woeful time the obscure bird
[SHK] Clamour 'd the livelong night some say the earth
[SHK] Was feverous and did shake
[SHK] 'T was a rough night
[SHK] My young remembrance can not parallel
[SHK] A fellow to it
[SHK] O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart
[SHK] Can not conceive nor name thee
[SHK] What 's the matter
[SHK] Confusion now hath made his masterpiece
[SHK] Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
[SHK] The Lord 's anointed temple and stole thence
[SHK] The life o the building
[SHK] What is 't you say the life
[SHK] Mean you his majesty
[SHK] Approach the chamber and destroy your sight
[SHK] With a new Gorgon do not bid me speak
[SHK] See and then speak yourselves
[SHK] Awake awake
[SHK] Ring the alarum-bell Murder and treason
[SHK] Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake
[SHK] Shake off this downy sleep death 's counterfeit
[SHK] And look on death itself up up and see
[SHK] The great doom 's image Malcolm Banquo
[SHK] As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
[SHK] To countenance this horror Ring the bell
[SHK] What 's the business
[SHK] That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
[SHK] The sleepers of the house speak speak
[SHK] O gentle lady
[SHK] 'T is not for you to hear what I can speak
[SHK] The repetition in a woman 's ear
[SHK] Would murder as it fell
[SHK] O Banquo Banquo
[SHK] Our royal master 's murder 'd
[SHK] Woe alas
[SHK] What in our house
[SHK] Too cruel any where
[SHK] Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself
[SHK] And say it is not so
[SHK] Had I but died an hour before this chance
[SHK] I had lived a blessed time for from this instant
[SHK] There 's nothing serious in mortality
[SHK] All is but toys renown and grace is dead
[SHK] The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
[SHK] Is left this vault to brag of
[SHK] What is amiss
[SHK] You are and do not know't
[SHK] The spring the head the fountain of your blood
[SHK] Is stopp 'd the very source of it is stopp 'd
[SHK] Your royal father 's murder 'd
[SHK] O by whom
[SHK] Those of his chamber as it seem 'd had done 't
[SHK] Their hands and faces were an badged with blood
[SHK] So were their daggers which unwiped we found
[SHK] Upon their pillows
[SHK] They stared and were distracted no man 's life
[SHK] Was to be trusted with them
[SHK] O yet I do repent me of my fury
[SHK] That I did kill them
[SHK] Wherefore did you so
[SHK] Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious
[SHK] Loyal and neutral in a moment No man
[SHK] The expedition my violent love
[SHK] Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan
[SHK] His silver skin laced with his golden blood
[SHK] And his gash 'd stabs look 'd like a breach in nature
[SHK] For ruin 's wasteful entrance there the murderers
[SHK] Steep 'd in the colours of their trade their daggers
[SHK] Unmannerly breech 'd with gore who could refrain
[SHK] That had a heart to love and in that heart
[SHK] Courage to make 's love known
[SHK] Help me hence ho
[SHK] Look to the lady
[SHK] That most may claim this argument for ours
[SHK] where our fate
[SHK] Hid in an auger-hole may rush and seize us
[SHK] Let 's away
[SHK] Our tears are not yet brew 'd
[SHK] Upon the foot of motion
[SHK] Look to the lady
[SHK] And when we have our naked frailties hid
[SHK] That suffer in exposure let us meet
[SHK] And question this most bloody piece of work
[SHK] To know it further Fears and scruples shake us
[SHK] In the great hand of God I stand and thence
[SHK] Against the undivulged pretence I fight
[SHK] Of treasonous malice
[SHK] And so do I
[SHK] So all
[SHK] Let 's briefly put on manly readiness
[SHK] And meet i the hall together
[SHK] Well contented
[SHK] What will you do Let 's not consort with them
[SHK] To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
[SHK] Which the false man does easy I 'll to England
[SHK] To Ireland I our separated fortune
[SHK] Shall keep us both the safer where we are
[SHK] There 's daggers in men 's smiles the near in blood
[SHK] The nearer bloody
[SHK] This murderous shaft that 's shot
[SHK] Hath not yet lighted and our safest way
[SHK] Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse
[SHK] And let us not be dainty of leave-taking
[SHK] But shift away there 's warrant in that theft
[SHK] Which steals itself when there 's no mercy left
[SHK] Threescore and ten I can remember well
[SHK] Within the volume of which time I have seen
[SHK] Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
[SHK] Hath trifled former knowings
[SHK] Ah good father
[SHK] Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man 's act
[SHK] Threaten his bloody stage by the clock 't is day
[SHK] And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
[SHK] Is't night 's predominance or the day 's shame
[SHK] That darkness does the face of earth entomb
[SHK] When living light should kiss it
[SHK] 'T is unnatural
[SHK] Even like the deed that 's done On Tuesday last
[SHK] A falcon towering in her pride of place
[SHK] Was by a mousing owl hawk 'd at and kill 'd
[SHK] And Duncan 's horses -- a thing most strange and certain --
[SHK] Beauteous and swift the minions of their race
[SHK] Turn 'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
[SHK] Contending 'gainst obedience as they would make
[SHK] War with mankind
[SHK] 'T is said they eat each other
[SHK] They did so to the amazement of mine eyes
[SHK] That look 'd upo n't Here comes the good Macduff
[SHK] How goes the world sir now
[SHK] Why see you not
[SHK] Is't known who did this more than bloody deed
[SHK] Those that Macbeth hath slain
[SHK] Alas the day
[SHK] What good could they pretend
[SHK] They were suborn 'd
[SHK] Malcolm and Donalbain the king 's two sons
[SHK] Are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them
[SHK] Suspicion of the deed
[SHK] 'Gainst nature still
[SHK] Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
[SHK] Thine own life 's means Then 't is most like
[SHK] The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth
[SHK] He is already named and gone to Scone
[SHK] To be invested
[SHK] Where is Duncan 's body
[SHK] Carried to Colmekill
[SHK] The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
[SHK] And guardian of their bones
[SHK] Will you to Scone
[SHK] No cousin I 'll to Fife
[SHK] Well I will thither
[SHK] Well may you see things well done there adieu
[SHK] Lest our old robes sit easier than our new
[SHK] Farewell father
[SHK] God 's benison go with you and with those
[SHK] That would make good of bad and friends of foes
[SHK] Thou hast it now king Cawdor Glamis all
[SHK] As the weird women promised and I fear
[SHK] Thou play'dst most foully for't yet it was said
[SHK] It should not stand in thy posterity
[SHK] But that myself should be the root and father
[SHK] Of many kings If there come truth from them --
[SHK] As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine --
[SHK] Why by the verities on thee made good
[SHK] May they not be my oracles as well
[SHK] And set me up in hope But hush no more
[SHK] Here 's our chief guest
[SHK] If he had been forgotten
[SHK] It had been as a gap in our great feast
[SHK] And all-thing unbecoming
[SHK] To-night we hold a solemn supper sir
[SHK] And I 'll request your presence
[SHK] Let your highness
[SHK] Command upon me to the which my duties
[SHK] Are with a most indissoluble tie
[SHK] For ever knit
[SHK] Ride you this afternoon
[SHK] Ay my good lord
[SHK] We should have else desired your good advice
[SHK] Which still hath been both grave and prosperous
[SHK] In this day 's council but we 'll take to-morrow
[SHK] Is't far you ride
[SHK] As far my lord as will fill up the time
[SHK] 'Twixt this and supper go not my horse the better
[SHK] I must become a borrower of the night
[SHK] For a dark hour or twain
[SHK] Fail not our feast
[SHK] My lord I will not
[SHK] We hear our bloody cousins are bestow 'd
[SHK] In England and in Ireland not confessing
[SHK] Their cruel parricide filling their hearers
[SHK] With strange invention but of that to-morrow
[SHK] When therewithal we shall have cause of state
[SHK] Craving us jointly Hie you to horse adieu
[SHK] Till you return at night Goes Fleance with you
[SHK] Ay my good lord our time does call upon 's
[SHK] I wish your horses swift and sure of foot
[SHK] And so I do commend you to their backs Farewell
[SHK] Let every man be master of his time
[SHK] Till seven at night to make society
[SHK] The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
[SHK] Till supper-time alone while then God be with you
[SHK] Sirrah a word with you attend those men
[SHK] Our pleasure
[SHK] They are my lord without the palace gate
[SHK] Bring them before us
[SHK] To be thus is nothing
[SHK] But to be safely thus. -- Our fears in Banquo
[SHK] Stick deep and in his royalty of nature
[SHK] Reigns that which would be fear 'd 't is much he dares
[SHK] And to that dauntless temper of his mind
[SHK] He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
[SHK] To act in safety There is none but he
[SHK] Whose being I do fear and under him
[SHK] My Genius is rebuked as it is said
[SHK] Mark Antony 's was by Caesar He chid the sisters
[SHK] When first they put the name of king upon me
[SHK] And bade them speak to him then prophet-like
[SHK] They hail 'd him father to a line of kings
[SHK] Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
[SHK] And put a barren sceptre in my gripe
[SHK] Thence to be wrench 'd with an unlineal hand
[SHK] No son of mine succeeding If 't be so
[SHK] For Banquo 's issue have I filed my mind
[SHK] For them the gracious Duncan have I murder 'd
[SHK] Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
[SHK] Only for them and mine eternal jewel
[SHK] Given to the common enemy of man
[SHK] To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings
[SHK] Rather than so come fate into the list
[SHK] And champion me to the utterance Who 's there
[SHK] Now go to the door and stay there till we call
[SHK] Was it not yesterday we spoke together
[SHK] It was so please your highness
[SHK] Well then now
[SHK] Have you consider 'd of my speeches Know
[SHK] That it was he in the times past which held you
[SHK] So under fortune which you thought had been
[SHK] Our innocent self this I made good to you
[SHK] In our last conference pass 'd in probation with you
[SHK] How you were borne in hand how cross 'd
[SHK] the instruments
[SHK] Who wrought with them and all things else that might
[SHK] To half a soul and to a notion crazed
[SHK] Say 'Thus did Banquo
[SHK] You made it known to us
[SHK] I did so and went further which is now
[SHK] Our point of second meeting Do you find
[SHK] Your patience so predominant in your nature
[SHK] That you can let this go Are you so gospell 'd
[SHK] To pray for this good man and for his issue
[SHK] Whose heavy hand hath bow 'd you to the grave
[SHK] And beggar 'd yours for ever
[SHK] We are men my liege
[SHK] Ay in the catalogue ye go for men
[SHK] As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
[SHK] Shoughs water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept
[SHK] All by the name of dogs the valued file
[SHK] Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
[SHK] The housekeeper the hunter every one
[SHK] According to the gift which bounteous nature
[SHK] Hath in him closed whereby he does receive
[SHK] Particular addition from the bill
[SHK] That writes them all alike and so of men
[SHK] Now if you have a station in the file
[SHK] Not i the worst rank of manhood say 't
[SHK] And I will put that business in your bosoms
[SHK] Whose execution takes your enemy off
[SHK] Grapples you to the heart and love of us
[SHK] Who wear our health but sickly in his life
[SHK] Which in his death were perfect
[SHK] I am one my liege
[SHK] Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
[SHK] Have so incensed that I am reckless what
[SHK] I do to spite the world
[SHK] And I another
[SHK] So weary with disasters tugg 'd with fortune
[SHK] That I would set my lie on any chance
[SHK] To mend it or be rid o n't
[SHK] Both of you
[SHK] Know Banquo was your enemy
[SHK] True my lord
[SHK] So is he mine and in such bloody distance
[SHK] That every minute of his being thrusts
[SHK] Against my near'st of life and though I could
[SHK] With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
[SHK] And bid my will avouch it yet I must not
[SHK] For certain friends that are both his and mine
[SHK] Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
[SHK] Who I myself struck down and thence it is
[SHK] That I to your assistance do make love
[SHK] Masking the business from the common eye
[SHK] For sundry weighty reasons
[SHK] We shall my lord
[SHK] Perform what you command us
[SHK] Though our lives --
[SHK] Your spirits shine through you Within this hour at most
[SHK] I will advise you where to plant yourselves
[SHK] Acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time
[SHK] The moment o n't for't must be done to-night
[SHK] And something from the palace always thought
[SHK] That I require a clearness and with him --
[SHK] To leave no rubs nor botches in the work --
[SHK] Fleance his son that keeps him company
[SHK] Whose absence is no less material to me
[SHK] Than is his father 's must embrace the fate
[SHK] Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart
[SHK] I 'll come to you anon
[SHK] We are resolved my lord
[SHK] I 'll call upon you straight abide within
[SHK] It is concluded Banquo thy soul 's flight
[SHK] If it find heaven must find it out to-night
[SHK] Is Banquo gone from court
[SHK] Ay madam but returns again to-night
[SHK] Say to the king I would attend his leisure
[SHK] For a few words
[SHK] Madam I will
[SHK] Nought 's had all 's spent
[SHK] Where our desire is got without content
[SHK] 'T is safer to be that which we destroy
[SHK] Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
[SHK] How now my lord why do you keep alone
[SHK] Of sorriest fancies your companions making
[SHK] Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
[SHK] With them they think on Things without all remedy
[SHK] Should be without regard what 's done is done
[SHK] We have scotch 'd the snake not kill 'd it
[SHK] She 'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
[SHK] Remains in danger of her former tooth
[SHK] But let the frame of things disjoint both the
[SHK] worlds suffer
[SHK] Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
[SHK] In the affliction of these terrible dreams
[SHK] That shake us nightly better be with the dead
[SHK] Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
[SHK] Than on the torture of the mind to lie
[SHK] In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave
[SHK] After life 's fitful fever he sleeps well
[SHK] Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
[SHK] Malice domestic foreign levy nothing
[SHK] Can touch him further
[SHK] Come on
[SHK] Gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks
[SHK] Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night
[SHK] So shall I love and so I pray be you
[SHK] Let your remembrance apply to Banquo
[SHK] Present him eminence both with eye and tongue
[SHK] Unsafe the while that we
[SHK] Must lave our honours in these flattering streams
[SHK] And make our faces vizards to our hearts
[SHK] Disguising what they are
[SHK] You must leave this
[SHK] O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
[SHK] Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives
[SHK] But in them nature 's copy 's not eterne
[SHK] There 's comfort yet they are assailable
[SHK] Then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown
[SHK] His cloister 'd flight ere to black Hecate 's summons
[SHK] The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
[SHK] Hath rung night 's yawning peal there shall be done
[SHK] A deed of dreadful note
[SHK] What 's to be done
[SHK] Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
[SHK] Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night
[SHK] Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
[SHK] And with thy bloody and invisible hand
[SHK] Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
[SHK] Which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow
[SHK] Makes wing to the rooky wood
[SHK] Good things of day begin to droop and drowse
[SHK] While night 's black agents to their preys do rouse
[SHK] Thou marvell'st at my words but hold thee still
[SHK] Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
[SHK] So prithee go with me
[SHK] But who did bid thee join with us
[SHK] Macbeth
[SHK] He needs not our mistrust since he delivers
[SHK] Our offices and what we have to do
[SHK] To the direction just
[SHK] Then stand with us
[SHK] The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day
[SHK] Now spurs the lated traveller apace
[SHK] To gain the timely inn and near approaches
[SHK] The subject of our watch
[SHK] Hark I hear horses
[SHK] Then 't is he the rest
[SHK] That are within the note of expectation
[SHK] Already are i the court
[SHK] His horses go about
[SHK] Almost a mile but he does usually
[SHK] So all men do from hence to the palace gate
[SHK] Make it their walk
[SHK] A light a light
[SHK] 'T is he
[SHK] Stand to't
[SHK] It will be rain to-night
[SHK] Let it come down
[SHK] O treachery Fly good Fleance fly fly fly
[SHK] Thou mayst revenge O slave
[SHK] Who did strike out the light
[SHK] Wast not the way
[SHK] There 's but one down the son is fled
[SHK] We have lost
[SHK] Best half of our affair
[SHK] Well let 's away and say how much is done
[SHK] You know your own degrees sit down at first
[SHK] And last the hearty welcome
[SHK] Thanks to your majesty
[SHK] Ourself will mingle with society
[SHK] And play the humble host
[SHK] Our hostess keeps her state but in best time
[SHK] We will require her welcome
[SHK] Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends
[SHK] For my heart speaks they are welcome
[SHK] See they encounter thee with their hearts thanks
[SHK] Both sides are even here I 'll sit i the midst
[SHK] Be large in mirth anon we 'll drink a measure
[SHK] The table round
[SHK] There 's blood on thy face
[SHK] 'T is Banquo 's then
[SHK] 'T is better thee without than he within
[SHK] Is he dispatch 'd
[SHK] My lord his throat is cut that I did for him
[SHK] Thou art the best o the cut-throats yet he 's good
[SHK] That did the like for Fleance if thou didst it
[SHK] Thou art the nonpareil
[SHK] Most royal sir
[SHK] Fleance is 'scaped
[SHK] Then comes my fit again I had else been perfect
[SHK] Whole as the marble founded as the rock
[SHK] As broad and general as the casing air
[SHK] But now I am cabin 'd cribb 'd confined bound in
[SHK] To saucy doubts and fears But Banquo 's safe
[SHK] Ay my good lord safe in a ditch he bides
[SHK] With twenty trenched gashes on his head
[SHK] The least a death to nature
[SHK] Thanks for that
[SHK] There the grown serpent lies the worm that 's fled
[SHK] Hath nature that in time will venom breed
[SHK] No teeth for the present Get thee gone to-morrow
[SHK] We 'll hear ourselves again
[SHK] My royal lord
[SHK] You do not give the cheer the feast is sold
[SHK] That is not often vouch 'd while 't is a-making
[SHK] 'T is given with welcome to feed were best at home
[SHK] From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony
[SHK] Meeting were bare without it
[SHK] Sweet remembrancer
[SHK] Now good digestion wait on appetite
[SHK] And health on both
[SHK] May't please your highness sit
[SHK] Here had we now our country 's honour roof 'd
[SHK] Were the graced person of our Banquo present
[SHK] Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
[SHK] Than pity for mischance
[SHK] His absence sir
[SHK] Lays blame upon his promise Please't your highness
[SHK] To grace us with your royal company
[SHK] The table 's full
[SHK] Here is a place reserved sir
[SHK] Where
[SHK] Here my good lord What is't that moves your highness
[SHK] Which of you have done this
[SHK] What my good lord
[SHK] Thou canst not say I did it never shake
[SHK] Thy gory locks at me
[SHK] Gentlemen rise his highness is not well
[SHK] Sit worthy friends my lord is often thus
[SHK] And hath been from his youth pray you keep seat
[SHK] The fit is momentary upon a thought
[SHK] He will again be well if much you note him
[SHK] You shall offend him and extend his passion
[SHK] Feed and regard him not Are you a man
[SHK] Ay and a bold one that dare look on that
[SHK] Which might appal the devil
[SHK] O proper stuff
[SHK] This is the very painting of your fear
[SHK] This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
[SHK] Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts
[SHK] Impostors to true fear would well become
[SHK] A woman 's story at a winter 's fire
[SHK] Authorized by her grandam Shame itself
[SHK] Why do you make such faces When all 's done
[SHK] You look but on a stool
[SHK] Prithee see there behold look lo
[SHK] how say you
[SHK] Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too
[SHK] If charnel-houses and our graves must send
[SHK] Those that we bury back our monuments
[SHK] Shall be the maws of kites
[SHK] What quite unmann 'd in folly
[SHK] If I stand here I saw him
[SHK] Fie for shame
[SHK] Blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time
[SHK] Ere human statute purged the gentle weal
[SHK] Ay and since too murders have been perform 'd
[SHK] Too terrible for the ear the times have been
[SHK] That when the brains were out the man would die
[SHK] And there an end but now they rise again
[SHK] With twenty mortal murders on their crowns
[SHK] And push us from our stools this is more strange
[SHK] Than such a murder is
[SHK] My worthy lord
[SHK] Your noble friends do lack you
[SHK] I do forget
[SHK] Do not muse at me my most worthy friends
[SHK] I have a strange infirmity which is nothing
[SHK] To those that know me Come love and health to all
[SHK] Then I 'll sit down Give me some wine fill full
[SHK] I drink to the general joy o the whole table
[SHK] And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
[SHK] Would he were here to all and him we thirst
[SHK] And all to all
[SHK] Our duties and the pledge
[SHK] Avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee
[SHK] Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
[SHK] Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
[SHK] Which thou dost glare with
[SHK] Think of this good peers
[SHK] But as a thing of custom 't is no other
[SHK] Only it spoils the pleasure of the time
[SHK] What man dare I dare
[SHK] Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear
[SHK] The arm 'd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger
[SHK] Take any shape but that and my firm nerves
[SHK] Shall never tremble or be alive again
[SHK] And dare me to the desert with thy sword
[SHK] If trembling I inhabit then protest me
[SHK] The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow
[SHK] Unreal mockery hence
[SHK] Why so being gone
[SHK] I am a man again Pray you sit still
[SHK] You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting
[SHK] With most admired disorder
[SHK] Can such things be
[SHK] And overcome us like a summer 's cloud
[SHK] Without our special wonder You make me strange
[SHK] Even to the disposition that I owe
[SHK] When now I think you can behold such sights
[SHK] And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
[SHK] When mine is blanched with fear
[SHK] What sights my lord
[SHK] I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
[SHK] Question enrages him At once good night
[SHK] Stand not upon the order of your going
[SHK] But go at once
[SHK] Good night and better health
[SHK] Attend his majesty
[SHK] A kind good night to all
[SHK] It will have blood they say blood will have blood
[SHK] Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
[SHK] Augurs and understood relations have
[SHK] By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
[SHK] The secret'st man of blood What is the night
[SHK] Almost at odds with morning which is which
[SHK] How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person
[SHK] At our great bidding
[SHK] Did you send to him sir
[SHK] I hear it by the way but I will send
[SHK] There 's not a one of them but in his house
[SHK] I keep a servant fee 'd I will to-morrow
[SHK] And betimes I will to the weird sisters
[SHK] More shall they speak for now I am bent to know
[SHK] By the worst means the worst For mine own good
[SHK] All causes shall give way I am in blood
[SHK] Stepp 'd in so far that should I wade no more
[SHK] Returning were as tedious as go o'er
[SHK] Strange things I have in head that will to hand
[SHK] Which must be acted ere they may be scann 'd
[SHK] You lack the season of all natures sleep
[SHK] Come we 'll to sleep My strange and self-abuse
[SHK] Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
[SHK] We are yet but young in deed
[SHK] Why how now Hecate you look angerly
[SHK] Have I not reason beldams as you are
[SHK] Saucy and overbold How did you dare
[SHK] To trade and traffic with Macbeth
[SHK] In riddles and affairs of death
[SHK] And I the mistress of your charms
[SHK] The close contriver of all harms
[SHK] Was never call 'd to bear my part
[SHK] Or show the glory of our art
[SHK] And which is worse all you have done
[SHK] Hath been but for a wayward son
[SHK] Spiteful and wrathful who as others do
[SHK] Loves for his own ends not for you
[SHK] But make amends now get you gone
[SHK] And at the pit of Acheron
[SHK] Meet me i the morning thither he
[SHK] Will come to know his destiny
[SHK] Your vessels and your spells provide
[SHK] Your charms and every thing beside
[SHK] I am for the air this night I 'll spend
[SHK] Unto a dismal and a fatal end
[SHK] Great business must be wrought ere noon
[SHK] Upon the corner of the moon
[SHK] There hangs a vaporous drop profound
[SHK] I 'll catch it ere it come to ground
[SHK] And that distill 'd by magic sleights
[SHK] Shall raise such artificial sprites
[SHK] As by the strength of their illusion
[SHK] Shall draw him on to his confusion
[SHK] He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
[SHK] He hopes 'bove wisdom grace and fear
[SHK] And you all know security
[SHK] Is mortals chiefest enemy
[SHK] Hark I am call 'd my little spirit see
[SHK] Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me
[SHK] Come let 's make haste she 'll soon be back again
[SHK] My former speeches have but hit your thoughts
[SHK] Which can interpret further only I say
[SHK] Things have been strangely borne The
[SHK] gracious Duncan
[SHK] Was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead
[SHK] And the right-valiant Banquo walk 'd too late
[SHK] Whom you may say if't please you Fleance kill 'd
[SHK] For Fleance fled men must not walk too late
[SHK] Who can not want the thought how monstrous
[SHK] It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
[SHK] To kill their gracious father damned fact
[SHK] How it did grieve Macbeth did he not straight
[SHK] In pious rage the two delinquents tear
[SHK] That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
[SHK] Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too
[SHK] For 'twould have anger 'd any heart alive
[SHK] To hear the men deny't So that I say
[SHK] He has borne all things well and I do think
[SHK] That had he Duncan 's sons under his key --
[SHK] As a n't please heaven he shall not -- they
[SHK] should find
[SHK] What 'twere to kill a father so should Fleance
[SHK] But peace for from broad words and 'cause he fail 'd
[SHK] His presence at the tyrant 's feast I hear
[SHK] Macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell
[SHK] Where he bestows himself
[SHK] The son of Duncan
[SHK] From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
[SHK] Lives in the English court and is received
[SHK] Of the most pious Edward with such grace
[SHK] That the malevolence of fortune nothing
[SHK] Takes from his high respect thither Macduff
[SHK] Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
[SHK] To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
[SHK] That by the help of these -- with Him above
[SHK] To ratify the work -- we may again
[SHK] Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
[SHK] Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
[SHK] Do faithful homage and receive free honours
[SHK] All which we pine for now and this report
[SHK] Hath so exasperate the king that he
[SHK] Prepares for some attempt of war
[SHK] Sent he to Macduff
[SHK] He did and with an absolute 'Sir not I
[SHK] The cloudy messenger turns me his back
[SHK] And hums as who should say 'You 'll rue the time
[SHK] That clogs me with this answer
[SHK] And that well might
[SHK] Advise him to a caution to hold what distance
[SHK] His wisdom can provide Some holy angel
[SHK] Fly to the court of England and unfold
[SHK] His message ere he come that a swift blessing
[SHK] May soon return to this our suffering country
[SHK] Under a hand accursed
[SHK] I 'll send my prayers with him
[SHK] Thrice the brinded cat hath mew 'd
[SHK] Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined
[SHK] Harpier cries 'T is time 't is time
[SHK] Round about the cauldron go
[SHK] In the poison 'd entrails throw
[SHK] Toad that under cold stone
[SHK] Days and nights has thirty-one
[SHK] Swelter 'd venom sleeping got
[SHK] Boil thou first i the charmed pot
[SHK] Double double toil and trouble
[SHK] Fire burn and cauldron bubble
[SHK] Fillet of a fenny snake
[SHK] In the cauldron boil and bake
[SHK] Eye of newt and toe of frog
[SHK] Wool of bat and tongue of dog
[SHK] Adder 's fork and blind-worm 's sting
[SHK] Lizard 's leg and owlet 's wing
[SHK] For a charm of powerful trouble
[SHK] Like a hell-broth boil and bubble
[SHK] Double double toil and trouble
[SHK] Fire burn and cauldron bubble
[SHK] Scale of dragon tooth of wolf
[SHK] Witches mummy maw and gulf
[SHK] Of the ravin 'd salt-sea shark
[SHK] Root of hemlock digg 'd i the dark
[SHK] Liver of blaspheming Jew
[SHK] Gall of goat and slips of yew
[SHK] Silver 'd in the moon 's eclipse
[SHK] Nose of Turk and Tartar 's lips
[SHK] Finger of birth-strangled babe
[SHK] Ditch-deliver 'd by a drab
[SHK] Make the gruel thick and slab
[SHK] Add thereto a tiger 's chaudron
[SHK] For the ingredients of our cauldron
[SHK] Double double toil and trouble
[SHK] Fire burn and cauldron bubble
[SHK] Cool it with a baboon 's blood
[SHK] Then the charm is firm and good
[SHK] O well done I commend your pains
[SHK] And every one shall share i the gains
[SHK] And now about the cauldron sing
[SHK] Live elves and fairies in a ring
[SHK] Enchanting all that you put in
[SHK] By the pricking of my thumbs
[SHK] Something wicked this way comes
[SHK] Open locks
[SHK] Whoever knocks
[SHK] How now you secret black and midnight hags
[SHK] What is't you do
[SHK] A deed without a name
[SHK] I conjure you by that which you profess
[SHK] Howe'er you come to know it answer me
[SHK] Though you untie the winds and let them fight
[SHK] Against the churches though the yesty waves
[SHK] Confound and swallow navigation up
[SHK] Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down
[SHK] Though castles topple on their warders heads
[SHK] Though palaces and pyramids do slope
[SHK] Their heads to their foundations though the treasure
[SHK] Of nature 's germens tumble all together
[SHK] Even till destruction sicken answer me
[SHK] To what I ask you
[SHK] Speak
[SHK] Demand
[SHK] We 'll answer
[SHK] Say if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths
[SHK] Or from our masters
[SHK] Call 'em let me see 'em
[SHK] Pour in sow 's blood that hath eaten
[SHK] Her nine farrow grease that 's sweaten
[SHK] From the murderer 's gibbet throw
[SHK] Into the flame
[SHK] Come high or low
[SHK] Thyself and office deftly show
[SHK] Tell me thou unknown power --
[SHK] He knows thy thought
[SHK] Hear his speech but say thou nought
[SHK] Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth beware Macduff
[SHK] Beware the thane of Fife Dismiss me Enough
[SHK] Whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks
[SHK] Thou hast harp 'd my fear aright but one
[SHK] word more --
[SHK] He will not be commanded here 's another
[SHK] More potent than the first
[SHK] Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth
[SHK] Had I three ears I'ld hear thee
[SHK] Be bloody bold and resolute laugh to scorn
[SHK] The power of man for none of woman born
[SHK] Shall harm Macbeth
[SHK] Then live Macduff what need I fear of thee
[SHK] But yet I 'll make assurance double sure
[SHK] And take a bond of fate thou shalt not live
[SHK] That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies
[SHK] And sleep in spite of thunder
[SHK] What is this
[SHK] That rises like the issue of a king
[SHK] And wears upon his baby-brow the round
[SHK] And top of sovereignty
[SHK] Listen but speak not to't
[SHK] Be lion-mettled proud and take no care
[SHK] Who chafes who frets or where conspirers are
[SHK] Macbeth shall never vanquish 'd be until
[SHK] Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
[SHK] Shall come against him
[SHK] That will never be
[SHK] Who can impress the forest bid the tree
[SHK] Unfix his earth-bound root Sweet bodements good
[SHK] Rebellion 's head rise never till the wood
[SHK] Of Birnam rise and our high-placed Macbeth
[SHK] Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath
[SHK] To time and mortal custom Yet my heart
[SHK] Throbs to know one thing tell me if your art
[SHK] Can tell so much shall Banquo 's issue ever
[SHK] Reign in this kingdom
[SHK] Seek to know no more
[SHK] I will be satisfied deny me this
[SHK] And an eternal curse fall on you Let me know
[SHK] Why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this
[SHK] Show
[SHK] Show
[SHK] Show
[SHK] Show his eyes and grieve his heart
[SHK] Come like shadows so depart
[SHK] Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo down
[SHK] Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls And thy hair
[SHK] Thou other gold-bound brow is like the first
[SHK] A third is like the former Filthy hags
[SHK] Why do you show me this A fourth Start eyes
[SHK] What will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
[SHK] Another yet A seventh I 'll see no more
[SHK] And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
[SHK] Which shows me many more and some I see
[SHK] That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry
[SHK] Horrible sight Now I see 't is true
[SHK] For the blood-bolter 'd Banquo smiles upon me
[SHK] And points at them for his
[SHK] What is this so
[SHK] Ay sir all this is so but why
[SHK] Stands Macbeth thus amazedly
[SHK] Come sisters cheer we up his sprites
[SHK] And show the best of our delights
[SHK] I 'll charm the air to give a sound
[SHK] While you perform your antic round
[SHK] That this great king may kindly say
[SHK] Our duties did his welcome pay
[SHK] Where are they Gone Let this pernicious hour
[SHK] Stand aye accursed in the calendar
[SHK] Come in without there
[SHK] What 's your grace 's will
[SHK] Saw you the weird sisters
[SHK] No my lord
[SHK] Came they not by you
[SHK] No indeed my lord
[SHK] Infected be the air whereon they ride
[SHK] And damn 'd all those that trust them I did hear
[SHK] The galloping of horse who was't came by
[SHK] 'T is two or three my lord that bring you word
[SHK] Macduff is fled to England
[SHK] Fled to England
[SHK] Ay my good lord
[SHK] Time thou anticipatest my dread exploits
[SHK] The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
[SHK] Unless the deed go with it from this moment
[SHK] The very firstlings of my heart shall be
[SHK] The firstlings of my hand And even now
[SHK] To crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done
[SHK] The castle of Macduff I will surprise
[SHK] Seize upon Fife give to the edge o the sword
[SHK] His wife his babes and all unfortunate souls
[SHK] That trace him in his line No boasting like a fool
[SHK] This deed I 'll do before this purpose cool
[SHK] But no more sights -- Where are these gentlemen
[SHK] Come bring me where they are
[SHK] What had he done to make him fly the land
[SHK] You must have patience madam
[SHK] He had none
[SHK] His flight was madness when our actions do not
[SHK] Our fears do make us traitors
[SHK] You know not
[SHK] Whether it was his wisdom or his fear
[SHK] Wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes
[SHK] His mansion and his titles in a place
[SHK] From whence himself does fly He loves us not
[SHK] He wants the natural touch for the poor wren
[SHK] The most diminutive of birds will fight
[SHK] Her young ones in her nest against the owl
[SHK] All is the fear and nothing is the love
[SHK] As little is the wisdom where the flight
[SHK] So runs against all reason
[SHK] My dearest coz
[SHK] I pray you school yourself but for your husband
[SHK] He is noble wise judicious and best knows
[SHK] The fits o the season I dare not speak
[SHK] much further
[SHK] But cruel are the times when we are traitors
[SHK] And do not know ourselves when we hold rumour
[SHK] From what we fear yet know not what we fear
[SHK] But float upon a wild and violent sea
[SHK] Each way and move I take my leave of you
[SHK] Shall not be long but I 'll be here again
[SHK] Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
[SHK] To what they were before My pretty cousin
[SHK] Blessing upon you
[SHK] Father 'd he is and yet he 's fatherless
[SHK] I am so much a fool should I stay longer
[SHK] It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
[SHK] I take my leave at once
[SHK] Sirrah your father 's dead
[SHK] And what will you do now How will you live
[SHK] As birds do mother
[SHK] What with worms and flies
[SHK] With what I get I mean and so do they
[SHK] Poor bird thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime
[SHK] The pitfall nor the gin
[SHK] Why should I mother Poor birds they are not set for
[SHK] My father is not dead for all your saying
[SHK] Yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father
[SHK] Nay how will you do for a husband
[SHK] Why I can buy me twenty at any market
[SHK] Then you 'll buy 'em to sell again
[SHK] Thou speak'st with all thy wit and yet i faith
[SHK] With wit enough for thee
[SHK] Was my father a traitor mother
[SHK] Ay that he was
[SHK] What is a traitor
[SHK] Why one that swears and lies
[SHK] And be all traitors that do so
[SHK] Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
[SHK] And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
[SHK] Every one
[SHK] Who must hang them
[SHK] Why the honest men
[SHK] Then the liars and swearers are fools
[SHK] for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
[SHK] the honest men and hang up them
[SHK] Now God help thee poor monkey
[SHK] But how wilt thou do for a father
[SHK] If he were dead you'ld weep for
[SHK] him if you would not it were a good sign
[SHK] that I should quickly have a new father
[SHK] Poor prattler how thou talk'st
[SHK] Bless you fair dame I am not to you known
[SHK] Though in your state of honour I am perfect
[SHK] I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
[SHK] If you will take a homely man 's advice
[SHK] Be not found here hence with your little ones
[SHK] To fright you thus methinks I am too savage
[SHK] To do worse to you were fell cruelty
[SHK] Which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you
[SHK] I dare abide no longer
[SHK] Whither should I fly
[SHK] I have done no harm But I remember now
[SHK] I am in this earthly world where to do harm
[SHK] Is often laudable to do good sometime
[SHK] Accounted dangerous folly why then alas
[SHK] Do I put up that womanly defence
[SHK] To say I have done no harm
[SHK] What are these faces
[SHK] Where is your husband
[SHK] I hope in no place so unsanctified
[SHK] Where such as thou mayst find him
[SHK] He 's a traitor
[SHK] Thou liest thou shag-hair 'd villain
[SHK] What you egg
[SHK] Young fry of treachery
[SHK] He has kill 'd me mother
[SHK] Run away I pray you
[SHK] Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
[SHK] Weep our sad bosoms empty
[SHK] Let us rather
[SHK] Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
[SHK] Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom each new morn
[SHK] New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
[SHK] Strike heaven on the face that it resounds
[SHK] As if it felt with Scotland and yell 'd out
[SHK] Like syllable of dolour
[SHK] What I believe I 'll wail
[SHK] What know believe and what I can redress
[SHK] As I shall find the time to friend I will
[SHK] What you have spoke it may be so perchance
[SHK] This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
[SHK] Was once thought honest you have loved him well
[SHK] He hath not touch 'd you yet I am young
[SHK] but something
[SHK] You may deserve of him through me and wisdom
[SHK] To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
[SHK] To appease an angry god
[SHK] I am not treacherous
[SHK] But Macbeth is
[SHK] A good and virtuous nature may recoil
[SHK] In an imperial charge But I shall crave
[SHK] your pardon
[SHK] That which you are my thoughts can not transpose
[SHK] Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
[SHK] Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
[SHK] Yet grace must still look so
[SHK] I have lost my hopes
[SHK] Perchance even there where I did find my doubts
[SHK] Why in that rawness left you wife and child
[SHK] Those precious motives those strong knots of love
[SHK] Without leave-taking I pray you
[SHK] Let not my jealousies be your dishonours
[SHK] But mine own safeties You may be rightly just
[SHK] Whatever I shall think
[SHK] Bleed bleed poor country
[SHK] Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
[SHK] For goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou
[SHK] thy wrongs
[SHK] The title is affeer 'd Fare thee well lord
[SHK] I would not be the villain that thou think'st
[SHK] For the whole space that 's in the tyrant 's grasp
[SHK] And the rich East to boot
[SHK] Be not offended
[SHK] I speak not as in absolute fear of you
[SHK] I think our country sinks beneath the yoke
[SHK] It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
[SHK] Is added to her wounds I think withal
[SHK] There would be hands uplifted in my right
[SHK] And here from gracious England have I offer
[SHK] Of goodly thousands but for all this
[SHK] When I shall tread upon the tyrant 's head
[SHK] Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
[SHK] Shall have more vices than it had before
[SHK] More suffer and more sundry ways than ever
[SHK] By him that shall succeed
[SHK] What should he be
[SHK] It is myself I mean in whom I know
[SHK] All the particulars of vice so grafted
[SHK] That when they shall be open 'd black Macbeth
[SHK] Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
[SHK] Esteem him as a lamb being compared
[SHK] With my confineless harms
[SHK] Not in the legions
[SHK] Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn 'd
[SHK] In evils to top Macbeth
[SHK] I grant him bloody
[SHK] Luxurious avaricious false deceitful
[SHK] Sudden malicious smacking of every sin
[SHK] That has a name but there 's no bottom none
[SHK] In my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
[SHK] Your matrons and your maids could not fill up
[SHK] The cistern of my lust and my desire
[SHK] All continent impediments would o'erbear
[SHK] That did oppose my will better Macbeth
[SHK] Than such an one to reign
[SHK] Boundless intemperance
[SHK] In nature is a tyranny it hath been
[SHK] The untimely emptying of the happy throne
[SHK] And fall of many kings But fear not yet
[SHK] To take upon you what is yours you may
[SHK] Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
[SHK] And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
[SHK] We have willing dames enough there can not be
[SHK] That vulture in you to devour so many
[SHK] As will to greatness dedicate themselves
[SHK] Finding it so inclined
[SHK] With this there grows
[SHK] In my most ill-composed affection such
[SHK] A stanchless avarice that were I king
[SHK] I should cut off the nobles for their lands
[SHK] Desire his jewels and this other 's house
[SHK] And my more-having would be as a sauce
[SHK] To make me hunger more that I should forge
[SHK] Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
[SHK] Destroying them for wealth
[SHK] This avarice
[SHK] Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
[SHK] Than summer-seeming lust and it hath been
[SHK] The sword of our slain kings yet do not fear
[SHK] Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
[SHK] Of your mere own all these are portable
[SHK] With other graces weigh 'd
[SHK] But I have none the king-becoming graces
[SHK] As justice verity temperance stableness
[SHK] Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
[SHK] Devotion patience courage fortitude
[SHK] I have no relish of them but abound
[SHK] In the division of each several crime
[SHK] Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should
[SHK] Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
[SHK] Uproar the universal peace confound
[SHK] All unity on earth
[SHK] O Scotland Scotland
[SHK] If such a one be fit to govern speak
[SHK] I am as I have spoken
[SHK] Fit to govern
[SHK] No not to live O nation miserable
[SHK] With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter 'd
[SHK] When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
[SHK] Since that the truest issue of thy throne
[SHK] By his own interdiction stands accursed
[SHK] And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father
[SHK] Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
[SHK] Oftener upon her knees than on her feet
[SHK] Died every day she lived Fare thee well
[SHK] These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
[SHK] Have banish 'd me from Scotland O my breast
[SHK] Thy hope ends here
[SHK] Macduff this noble passion
[SHK] Child of integrity hath from my soul
[SHK] Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
[SHK] To thy good truth and honour Devilish Macbeth
[SHK] By many of these trains hath sought to win me
[SHK] Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
[SHK] From over-credulous haste but God above
[SHK] Deal between thee and me for even now
[SHK] I put myself to thy direction and
[SHK] Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
[SHK] The taints and blames I laid upon myself
[SHK] For strangers to my nature I am yet
[SHK] Unknown to woman never was forsworn
[SHK] Scarcely have coveted what was mine own
[SHK] At no time broke my faith would not betray
[SHK] The devil to his fellow and delight
[SHK] No less in truth than life my first false speaking
[SHK] Was this upon myself what I am truly
[SHK] Is thine and my poor country 's to command
[SHK] Whither indeed before thy here-approach
[SHK] Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men
[SHK] Already at a point was setting forth
[SHK] Now we 'll together and the chance of goodness
[SHK] Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent
[SHK] Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
[SHK] 'T is hard to reconcile
[SHK] Well more anon. -- Comes the king forth I pray you
[SHK] Ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
[SHK] That stay his cure their malady convinces
[SHK] The great assay of art but at his touch --
[SHK] Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand --
[SHK] They presently amend
[SHK] I thank you doctor
[SHK] What 's the disease he means
[SHK] 'T is call 'd the evil
[SHK] A most miraculous work in this good king
[SHK] Which often since my here-remain in England
[SHK] I have seen him do How he solicits heaven
[SHK] Himself best knows but strangely-visited people
[SHK] All swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
[SHK] The mere despair of surgery he cures
[SHK] Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
[SHK] Put on with holy prayers and 't is spoken
[SHK] To the succeeding royalty he leaves
[SHK] The healing benediction With this strange virtue
[SHK] He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
[SHK] And sundry blessings hang about his throne
[SHK] That speak him full of grace
[SHK] See who comes here
[SHK] My countryman but yet I know him not
[SHK] My ever-gentle cousin welcome hither
[SHK] I know him now Good God betimes remove
[SHK] The means that makes us strangers
[SHK] Sir amen
[SHK] Stands Scotland where it did
[SHK] Alas poor country
[SHK] Almost afraid to know itself It can not
[SHK] Be call 'd our mother but our grave where nothing
[SHK] But who knows nothing is once seen to smile
[SHK] Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
[SHK] Are made not mark 'd where violent sorrow seems
[SHK] A modern ecstasy the dead man 's knell
[SHK] Is there scarce ask 'd for who and good men 's lives
[SHK] Expire before the flowers in their caps
[SHK] Dying or ere they sicken
[SHK] O relation
[SHK] Too nice and yet too true
[SHK] What 's the newest grief
[SHK] That of an hour 's age doth hiss the speaker
[SHK] Each minute teems a new one
[SHK] How does my wife
[SHK] Why well
[SHK] And all my children
[SHK] Well too
[SHK] The tyrant has not batter 'd at their peace
[SHK] No they were well at peace when I did leave 'em
[SHK] But not a niggard of your speech how goes't
[SHK] When I came hither to transport the tidings
[SHK] Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumour
[SHK] Of many worthy fellows that were out
[SHK] Which was to my belief witness 'd the rather
[SHK] For that I saw the tyrant 's power a-foot
[SHK] Now is the time of help your eye in Scotland
[SHK] Would create soldiers make our women fight
[SHK] To doff their dire distresses
[SHK] Be't their comfort
[SHK] We are coming thither gracious England hath
[SHK] Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men
[SHK] An older and a better soldier none
[SHK] That Christendom gives out
[SHK] Would I could answer
[SHK] This comfort with the like But I have words
[SHK] That would be howl 'd out in the desert air
[SHK] Where hearing should not latch them
[SHK] What concern they
[SHK] The general cause or is it a fee-grief
[SHK] Due to some single breast
[SHK] No mind that 's honest
[SHK] But in it shares some woe though the main part
[SHK] Pertains to you alone
[SHK] If it be mine
[SHK] Keep it not from me quickly let me have it
[SHK] Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever
[SHK] Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
[SHK] That ever yet they heard
[SHK] Hum I guess at it
[SHK] Your castle is surprised your wife and babes
[SHK] Savagely slaughter 'd to relate the manner
[SHK] Were on the quarry of these murder 'd deer
[SHK] To add the death of you
[SHK] Merciful heaven
[SHK] What man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows
[SHK] Give sorrow words the grief that does not speak
[SHK] Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break
[SHK] My children too
[SHK] Wife children servants all
[SHK] That could be found
[SHK] And I must be from thence
[SHK] My wife kill 'd too
[SHK] I have said
[SHK] Be comforted
[SHK] Let 's make us medicines of our great revenge
[SHK] To cure this deadly grief
[SHK] He has no children All my pretty ones
[SHK] Did you say all O hell-kite All
[SHK] What all my pretty chickens and their dam
[SHK] At one fell swoop
[SHK] Dispute it like a man
[SHK] I shall do so
[SHK] But I must also feel it as a man
[SHK] I can not but remember such things were
[SHK] That were most precious to me Did heaven look on
[SHK] And would not take their part Sinful Macduff
[SHK] They were all struck for thee naught that I am
[SHK] Not for their own demerits but for mine
[SHK] Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now
[SHK] Be this the whetstone of your sword let grief
[SHK] Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
[SHK] O I could play the woman with mine eyes
[SHK] And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens
[SHK] Cut short all intermission front to front
[SHK] Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
[SHK] Within my sword 's length set him if he 'scape
[SHK] Heaven forgive him too
[SHK] This tune goes manly
[SHK] Come go we to the king our power is ready
[SHK] Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth
[SHK] Is ripe for shaking and the powers above
[SHK] Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may
[SHK] The night is long that never finds the day
[SHK] I have two nights watched with you but can perceive
[SHK] no truth in your report When was it she last walked
[SHK] Since his majesty went into the field I have seen
[SHK] her rise from her bed throw her night-gown upon
[SHK] her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it
[SHK] write upo n't read it afterwards seal it and again
[SHK] return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep
[SHK] A great perturbation in nature to receive at once
[SHK] the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
[SHK] watching In this slumbery agitation besides her
[SHK] walking and other actual performances what at any
[SHK] time have you heard her say
[SHK] That sir which I will not report after her
[SHK] You may to me and 't is most meet you should
[SHK] Neither to you nor any one having no witness to
[SHK] confirm my speech
[SHK] Lo you here she comes This is her very guise
[SHK] and upon my life fast asleep Observe her stand close
[SHK] How came she by that light
[SHK] Why it stood by her she has light by her
[SHK] continually 't is her command
[SHK] You see her eyes are open
[SHK] Ay but their sense is shut
[SHK] What is it she does now Look how she rubs her hands
[SHK] It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus
[SHK] washing her hands I have known her continue in
[SHK] this a quarter of an hour
[SHK] Yet here 's a spot
[SHK] Hark she speaks I will set down what comes from
[SHK] her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
[SHK] Out damned spot out I say -- One two why
[SHK] then 't is time to do't. -- Hell is murky -- Fie my
[SHK] lord fie a soldier and afeard What need we
[SHK] fear who knows it when none can call our power to
[SHK] account -- Yet who would have thought the old man
[SHK] to have had so much blood in him
[SHK] Do you mark that
[SHK] The thane of Fife had a wife where is she now --
[SHK] What will these hands ne'er be clean -- No more o
[SHK] that my lord no more o that you mar all with
[SHK] this starting
[SHK] Go to go to you have known what you should not
[SHK] She has spoke what she should not I am sure of
[SHK] that heaven knows what she has known
[SHK] Here 's the smell of the blood still all the
[SHK] perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
[SHK] hand Oh oh oh
[SHK] What a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged
[SHK] I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
[SHK] dignity of the whole body
[SHK] Well well well --
[SHK] Pray God it be sir
[SHK] This disease is beyond my practise yet I have known
[SHK] those which have walked in their sleep who have died
[SHK] holily in their beds
[SHK] Wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so
[SHK] pale. -- I tell you yet again Banquo 's buried he
[SHK] can not come out on 's grave
[SHK] Even so
[SHK] To bed to bed there 's knocking at the gate
[SHK] come come come come give me your hand What 's
[SHK] done can not be undone. -- To bed to bed to bed
[SHK] Will she go now to bed
[SHK] Directly
[SHK] Foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds
[SHK] Do breed unnatural troubles infected minds
[SHK] To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
[SHK] More needs she the divine than the physician
[SHK] God God forgive us all Look after her
[SHK] Remove from her the means of all annoyance
[SHK] And still keep eyes upon her So good night
[SHK] My mind she has mated and amazed my sight
[SHK] I think but dare not speak
[SHK] Good night good doctor
[SHK] The English power is near led on by Malcolm
[SHK] His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
[SHK] Revenges burn in them for their dear causes
[SHK] Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
[SHK] Excite the mortified man
[SHK] Near Birnam wood
[SHK] Shall we well meet them that way are they coming
[SHK] Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother
[SHK] For certain sir he is not I have a file
[SHK] Of all the gentry there is Siward 's son
[SHK] And many unrough youths that even now
[SHK] Protest their first of manhood
[SHK] What does the tyrant
[SHK] Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
[SHK] Some say he 's mad others that lesser hate him
[SHK] Do call it valiant fury but for certain
[SHK] He can not buckle his distemper 'd cause
[SHK] Within the belt of rule
[SHK] Now does he feel
[SHK] His secret murders sticking on his hands
[SHK] Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach
[SHK] Those he commands move only in command
[SHK] Nothing in love now does he feel his title
[SHK] Hang loose about him like a giant 's robe
[SHK] Upon a dwarfish thief
[SHK] Who then shall blame
[SHK] His pester 'd senses to recoil and start
[SHK] When all that is within him does condemn
[SHK] Itself for being there
[SHK] Well march we on
[SHK] To give obedience where 't is truly owed
[SHK] Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
[SHK] And with him pour we in our country 's purge
[SHK] Each drop of us
[SHK] Or so much as it needs
[SHK] To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
[SHK] Make we our march towards Birnam
[SHK] Bring me no more reports let them fly all
[SHK] Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
[SHK] I can not taint with fear What 's the boy Malcolm
[SHK] Was he not born of woman The spirits that know
[SHK] All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus
[SHK] 'Fear not Macbeth no man that 's born of woman
[SHK] Shall e'er have power upon thee Then fly
[SHK] false thanes
[SHK] And mingle with the English epicures
[SHK] The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
[SHK] Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear
[SHK] The devil damn thee black thou cream-faced loon
[SHK] Where got'st thou that goose look
[SHK] There is ten thousand --
[SHK] Geese villain
[SHK] Soldiers sir
[SHK] Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear
[SHK] Thou lily-liver 'd boy What soldiers patch
[SHK] Death of thy soul those linen cheeks of thine
[SHK] Are counsellors to fear What soldiers whey-face
[SHK] The English force so please you
[SHK] Take thy face hence
[SHK] Seyton -- I am sick at heart
[SHK] When I behold -- Seyton I say -- This push
[SHK] Will cheer me ever or disseat me now
[SHK] I have lived long enough my way of life
[SHK] Is fall'n into the sear the yellow leaf
[SHK] And that which should accompany old age
[SHK] As honour love obedience troops of friends
[SHK] I must not look to have but in their stead
[SHK] Curses not loud but deep mouth-honour breath
[SHK] Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not Seyton
[SHK] What is your gracious pleasure
[SHK] What news more
[SHK] All is confirm 'd my lord which was reported
[SHK] I 'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack 'd
[SHK] Give me my armour
[SHK] 'T is not needed yet
[SHK] I 'll put it on
[SHK] Send out more horses skirr the country round
[SHK] Hang those that talk of fear Give me mine armour
[SHK] How does your patient doctor
[SHK] Not so sick my lord
[SHK] As she is troubled with thick coming fancies
[SHK] That keep her from her rest
[SHK] Cure her of that
[SHK] Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased
[SHK] Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
[SHK] Raze out the written troubles of the brain
[SHK] And with some sweet oblivious antidote
[SHK] Cleanse the stuff 'd bosom of that perilous stuff
[SHK] Which weighs upon the heart
[SHK] Therein the patient
[SHK] Must minister to himself
[SHK] Throw physic to the dogs I 'll none of it
[SHK] Come put mine armour on give me my staff
[SHK] Seyton send out Doctor the thanes fly from me
[SHK] Come sir dispatch If thou couldst doctor cast
[SHK] The water of my land find her disease
[SHK] And purge it to a sound and pristine health
[SHK] I would applaud thee to the very echo
[SHK] That should applaud again. -- Pull't off I say. --
[SHK] What rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug
[SHK] Would scour these English hence Hear'st thou of them
[SHK] Ay my good lord your royal preparation
[SHK] Makes us hear something
[SHK] Bring it after me
[SHK] I will not be afraid of death and bane
[SHK] Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane
[SHK] Profit again should hardly draw me here
[SHK] Cousins I hope the days are near at hand
[SHK] That chambers will be safe
[SHK] We doubt it nothing
[SHK] What wood is this before us
[SHK] The wood of Birnam
[SHK] Let every soldier hew him down a bough
[SHK] And bear't before him thereby shall we shadow
[SHK] The numbers of our host and make discovery
[SHK] Err in report of us
[SHK] It shall be done
[SHK] We learn no other but the confident tyrant
[SHK] Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
[SHK] Our setting down before 't
[SHK] 'T is his main hope
[SHK] For where there is advantage to be given
[SHK] Both more and less have given him the revolt
[SHK] And none serve with him but constrained things
[SHK] Whose hearts are absent too
[SHK] Let our just censures
[SHK] Attend the true event and put we on
[SHK] Industrious soldiership
[SHK] The time approaches
[SHK] That will with due decision make us know
[SHK] What we shall say we have and what we owe
[SHK] Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
[SHK] But certain issue strokes must arbitrate
[SHK] Towards which advance the war
[SHK] Hang out our banners on the outward walls
[SHK] The cry is still 'They come our castle 's strength
[SHK] Will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie
[SHK] Till famine and the ague eat them up
[SHK] Were they not forced with those that should be ours
[SHK] We might have met them dareful beard to beard
[SHK] And beat them backward home
[SHK] What is that noise
[SHK] It is the cry of women my good lord
[SHK] I have almost forgot the taste of fears
[SHK] The time has been my senses would have cool 'd
[SHK] To hear a night-shriek and my fell of hair
[SHK] Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
[SHK] As life were i n't I have supp 'd full with horrors
[SHK] Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
[SHK] Can not once start me
[SHK] Wherefore was that cry
[SHK] The queen my lord is dead
[SHK] She should have died hereafter
[SHK] There would have been a time for such a word
[SHK] To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
[SHK] Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
[SHK] To the last syllable of recorded time
[SHK] And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
[SHK] The way to dusty death Out out brief candle
[SHK] Life 's but a walking shadow a poor player
[SHK] That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
[SHK] And then is heard no more it is a tale
[SHK] Told by an idiot full of sound and fury
[SHK] Signifying nothing
[SHK] Thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly
[SHK] Gracious my lord
[SHK] I should report that which I say I saw
[SHK] But know not how to do it
[SHK] Well say sir
[SHK] As I did stand my watch upon the hill
[SHK] I look 'd toward Birnam and anon methought
[SHK] The wood began to move
[SHK] Liar and slave
[SHK] Let me endure your wrath if't be not so
[SHK] Within this three mile may you see it coming
[SHK] I say a moving grove
[SHK] If thou speak'st false
[SHK] Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
[SHK] Till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
[SHK] I care not if thou dost for me as much
[SHK] I pull in resolution and begin
[SHK] To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
[SHK] That lies like truth 'Fear not till Birnam wood
[SHK] Do come to Dunsinane and now a wood
[SHK] Comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out
[SHK] If this which he avouches does appear
[SHK] There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
[SHK] I gin to be aweary of the sun
[SHK] And wish the estate o the world were now undone
[SHK] Ring the alarum-bell Blow wind come wrack
[SHK] At least we 'll die with harness on our back
[SHK] Now near enough your leafy screens throw down
[SHK] And show like those you are You worthy uncle
[SHK] Shall with my cousin your right-noble son
[SHK] Lead our first battle worthy Macduff and we
[SHK] Shall take upon 's what else remains to do
[SHK] According to our order
[SHK] Fare you well
[SHK] Do we but find the tyrant 's power to-night
[SHK] Let us be beaten if we can not fight
[SHK] Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath
[SHK] Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death
[SHK] They have tied me to a stake I can not fly
[SHK] But bear-like I must fight the course What 's he
[SHK] That was not born of woman Such a one
[SHK] Am I to fear or none
[SHK] What is thy name
[SHK] Thou'lt be afraid to hear it
[SHK] No though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
[SHK] Than any is in hell
[SHK] My name 's Macbeth
[SHK] The devil himself could not pronounce a title
[SHK] More hateful to mine ear
[SHK] No nor more fearful
[SHK] Thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword
[SHK] I 'll prove the lie thou speak'st
[SHK] Thou wast born of woman
[SHK] But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn
[SHK] Brandish 'd by man that 's of a woman born
[SHK] That way the noise is Tyrant show thy face
[SHK] If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine
[SHK] My wife and children 's ghosts will haunt me still
[SHK] I can not strike at wretched kerns whose arms
[SHK] Are hired to bear their staves either thou Macbeth
[SHK] Or else my sword with an unbatter 'd edge
[SHK] I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be
[SHK] By this great clatter one of greatest note
[SHK] Seems bruited Let me find him fortune
[SHK] And more I beg not
[SHK] This way my lord the castle 's gently render 'd
[SHK] The tyrant 's people on both sides do fight
[SHK] The noble thanes do bravely in the war
[SHK] The day almost itself professes yours
[SHK] And little is to do
[SHK] We have met with foes
[SHK] That strike beside us
[SHK] Enter sir the castle
[SHK] Why should I play the Roman fool and die
[SHK] On mine own sword whiles I see lives the gashes
[SHK] Do better upon them
[SHK] Turn hell-hound turn
[SHK] Of all men else I have avoided thee
[SHK] But get thee back my soul is too much charged
[SHK] With blood of thine already
[SHK] I have no words
[SHK] My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
[SHK] Than terms can give thee out
[SHK] Thou losest labour
[SHK] As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
[SHK] With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
[SHK] Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
[SHK] I bear a charmed life which must not yield
[SHK] To one of woman born
[SHK] Despair thy charm
[SHK] And let the angel whom thou still hast served
[SHK] Tell thee Macduff was from his mother 's womb
[SHK] Untimely ripp 'd
[SHK] Accursed be that tongue that tells me so
[SHK] For it hath cow 'd my better part of man
[SHK] And be these juggling fiends no more believed
[SHK] That palter with us in a double sense
[SHK] That keep the word of promise to our ear
[SHK] And break it to our hope I 'll not fight with thee
[SHK] Then yield thee coward
[SHK] And live to be the show and gaze o the time
[SHK] We 'll have thee as our rarer monsters are
[SHK] Painted on a pole and underwrit
[SHK] 'Here may you see the tyrant
[SHK] I will not yield
[SHK] To kiss the ground before young Malcolm 's feet
[SHK] And to be baited with the rabble 's curse
[SHK] Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane
[SHK] And thou opposed being of no woman born
[SHK] Yet I will try the last Before my body
[SHK] I throw my warlike shield Lay on Macduff
[SHK] And damn 'd be him that first cries 'Hold enough
[SHK] I would the friends we miss were safe arrived
[SHK] Some must go off and yet by these I see
[SHK] So great a day as this is cheaply bought
[SHK] Macduff is missing and your noble son
[SHK] Your son my lord has paid a soldier 's debt
[SHK] He only lived but till he was a man
[SHK] The which no sooner had his prowess confirm 'd
[SHK] In the unshrinking station where he fought
[SHK] But like a man he died
[SHK] Then he is dead
[SHK] Ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow
[SHK] Must not be measured by his worth for then
[SHK] It hath no end
[SHK] Had he his hurts before
[SHK] Ay on the front
[SHK] Why then God 's soldier be he
[SHK] Had I as many sons as I have hairs
[SHK] I would not wish them to a fairer death
[SHK] And so his knell is knoll 'd
[SHK] He 's worth more sorrow
[SHK] And that I 'll spend for him
[SHK] He 's worth no more
[SHK] They say he parted well and paid his score
[SHK] And so God be with him Here comes newer comfort
[SHK] Hail king for so thou art behold where stands
[SHK] The usurper 's cursed head the time is free
[SHK] I see thee compass 'd with thy kingdom 's pearl
[SHK] That speak my salutation in their minds
[SHK] Whose voices I desire aloud with mine
[SHK] Hail King of Scotland
[SHK] Hail King of Scotland
[SHK] We shall not spend a large expense of time
[SHK] Before we reckon with your several loves
[SHK] And make us even with you My thanes and kinsmen
[SHK] Henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland
[SHK] In such an honour named What 's more to do
[SHK] Which would be planted newly with the time
[SHK] As calling home our exiled friends abroad
[SHK] That fled the snares of watchful tyranny
[SHK] Producing forth the cruel ministers
[SHK] Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
[SHK] Who as 't is thought by self and violent hands
[SHK] Took off her life this and what needful else
[SHK] That calls upon us by the grace of Grace
[SHK] We will perform in measure time and place
[SHK] So thanks to all at once and to each one
[SHK] Whom we invite to see us crown 'd at Scone
[SHK] In sooth I know not why I am so sad
[SHK] It wearies me you say it wearies you
[SHK] But how I caught it found it or came by it
[SHK] What stuff 't is made of whereof it is born
[SHK] I am to learn
[SHK] And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
[SHK] That I have much ado to know myself
[SHK] Your mind is tossing on the ocean
[SHK] There where your argosies with portly sail
[SHK] Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
[SHK] Or as it were the pageants of the sea
[SHK] Do overpeer the petty traffickers
[SHK] That curtsy to them do them reverence
[SHK] As they fly by them with their woven wings
[SHK] Believe me sir had I such venture forth
[SHK] The better part of my affections would
[SHK] Be with my hopes abroad I should be still
[SHK] Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
[SHK] Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
[SHK] And every object that might make me fear
[SHK] Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
[SHK] Would make me sad
[SHK] My wind cooling my broth
[SHK] Would blow me to an ague when I thought
[SHK] What harm a wind too great at sea might do
[SHK] I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
[SHK] But I should think of shallows and of flats
[SHK] And see my wealthy Andrew dock 'd in sand
[SHK] Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
[SHK] To kiss her burial Should I go to church
[SHK] And see the holy edifice of stone
[SHK] And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
[SHK] Which touching but my gentle vessel 's side
[SHK] Would scatter all her spices on the stream
[SHK] Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
[SHK] And in a word but even now worth this
[SHK] And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought
[SHK] To think on this and shall I lack the thought
[SHK] That such a thing bechanced would make me sad
[SHK] But tell not me I know Antonio
[SHK] Is sad to think upon his merchandise
[SHK] Believe me no I thank my fortune for it
[SHK] My ventures are not in one bottom trusted
[SHK] Nor to one place nor is my whole estate
[SHK] Upon the fortune of this present year
[SHK] Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
[SHK] Why then you are in love
[SHK] Fie fie
[SHK] Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad
[SHK] Because you are not merry and 'twere as easy
[SHK] For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
[SHK] Because you are not sad Now by two-headed Janus
[SHK] Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time
[SHK] Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
[SHK] And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper
[SHK] And other of such vinegar aspect
[SHK] That they 'll not show their teeth in way of smile
[SHK] Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable
[SHK] Here comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman
[SHK] Gratiano and Lorenzo Fare ye well
[SHK] We leave you now with better company
[SHK] I would have stay 'd till I had made you merry
[SHK] If worthier friends had not prevented me
[SHK] Your worth is very dear in my regard
[SHK] I take it your own business calls on you
[SHK] And you embrace the occasion to depart
[SHK] Good morrow my good lords
[SHK] Good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
[SHK] You grow exceeding strange must it be so
[SHK] We 'll make our leisures to attend on yours
[SHK] My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio
[SHK] We two will leave you but at dinner-time
[SHK] I pray you have in mind where we must meet
[SHK] I will not fail you
[SHK] You look not well Signior Antonio
[SHK] You have too much respect upon the world
[SHK] They lose it that do buy it with much care
[SHK] Believe me you are marvellously changed
[SHK] I hold the world but as the world Gratiano
[SHK] A stage where every man must play a part
[SHK] And mine a sad one
[SHK] Let me play the fool
[SHK] With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
[SHK] And let my liver rather heat with wine
[SHK] Than my heart cool with mortifying groans
[SHK] Why should a man whose blood is warm within
[SHK] Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
[SHK] Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
[SHK] By being peevish I tell thee what Antonio --
[SHK] I love thee and it is my love that speaks --
[SHK] There are a sort of men whose visages
[SHK] Do cream and mantle like a standing pond
[SHK] And do a wilful stillness entertain
[SHK] With purpose to be dress 'd in an opinion
[SHK] Of wisdom gravity profound conceit
[SHK] As who should say I am Sir Oracle
[SHK] And when I ope my lips let no dog bark
[SHK] O my Antonio I do know of these
[SHK] That therefore only are reputed wise
[SHK] For saying nothing when I am very sure
[SHK] If they should speak would almost damn those ears
[SHK] Which hearing them would call their brothers fools
[SHK] I 'll tell thee more of this another time
[SHK] But fish not with this melancholy bait
[SHK] For this fool gudgeon this opinion
[SHK] Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well awhile
[SHK] I 'll end my exhortation after dinner
[SHK] Well we will leave you then till dinner-time
[SHK] I must be one of these same dumb wise men
[SHK] For Gratiano never lets me speak
[SHK] Well keep me company but two years moe
[SHK] Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
[SHK] Farewell I 'll grow a talker for this gear
[SHK] Thanks i faith for silence is only commendable
[SHK] In a neat 's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
[SHK] Is that any thing now
[SHK] Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more
[SHK] than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two
[SHK] grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you
[SHK] shall seek all day ere you find them and when you
[SHK] have them they are not worth the search
[SHK] Well tell me now what lady is the same
[SHK] To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
[SHK] That you to-day promised to tell me of
[SHK] 'T is not unknown to you Antonio
[SHK] How much I have disabled mine estate
[SHK] By something showing a more swelling port
[SHK] Than my faint means would grant continuance
[SHK] Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
[SHK] From such a noble rate but my chief care
[SHK] Is to come fairly off from the great debts
[SHK] Wherein my time something too prodigal
[SHK] Hath left me gaged To you Antonio
[SHK] I owe the most in money and in love
[SHK] And from your love I have a warranty
[SHK] To unburden all my plots and purposes
[SHK] How to get clear of all the debts I owe
[SHK] I pray you good Bassanio let me know it
[SHK] And if it stand as you yourself still do
[SHK] Within the eye of honour be assured
[SHK] My purse my person my extremest means
[SHK] Lie all unlock 'd to your occasions
[SHK] In my school-days when I had lost one shaft
[SHK] I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
[SHK] The self-same way with more advised watch
[SHK] To find the other forth and by adventuring both
[SHK] I oft found both I urge this childhood proof
[SHK] Because what follows is pure innocence
[SHK] I owe you much and like a wilful youth
[SHK] That which I owe is lost but if you please
[SHK] To shoot another arrow that self way
[SHK] Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt
[SHK] As I will watch the aim or to find both
[SHK] Or bring your latter hazard back again
[SHK] And thankfully rest debtor for the first
[SHK] You know me well and herein spend but time
[SHK] To wind about my love with circumstance
[SHK] And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
[SHK] In making question of my uttermost
[SHK] Than if you had made waste of all I have
[SHK] Then do but say to me what I should do
[SHK] That in your knowledge may by me be done
[SHK] And I am prest unto it therefore speak
[SHK] In Belmont is a lady richly left
[SHK] And she is fair and fairer than that word
[SHK] Of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
[SHK] I did receive fair speechless messages
[SHK] Her name is Portia nothing undervalued
[SHK] To Cato 's daughter Brutus Portia
[SHK] Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
[SHK] For the four winds blow in from every coast
[SHK] Renowned suitors and her sunny locks
[SHK] Hang on her temples like a golden fleece
[SHK] Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos strand
[SHK] And many Jasons come in quest of her
[SHK] O my Antonio had I but the means
[SHK] To hold a rival place with one of them
[SHK] I have a mind presages me such thrift
[SHK] That I should questionless be fortunate
[SHK] Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea
[SHK] Neither have I money nor commodity
[SHK] To raise a present sum therefore go forth
[SHK] Try what my credit can in Venice do
[SHK] That shall be rack 'd even to the uttermost
[SHK] To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia
[SHK] Go presently inquire and so will I
[SHK] Where money is and I no question make
[SHK] To have it of my trust or for my sake
[SHK] By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of
[SHK] this great world
[SHK] You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in
[SHK] the same abundance as your good fortunes are and
[SHK] yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit
[SHK] with too much as they that starve with nothing It
[SHK] is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the
[SHK] mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but
[SHK] competency lives longer
[SHK] Good sentences and well pronounced
[SHK] They would be better if well followed
[SHK] If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
[SHK] do chapels had been churches and poor men 's
[SHK] cottages princes palaces It is a good divine that
[SHK] follows his own instructions I can easier teach
[SHK] twenty what were good to be done than be one of the
[SHK] twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may
[SHK] devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
[SHK] o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the
[SHK] youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
[SHK] cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
[SHK] choose me a husband O me the word 'choose I may
[SHK] neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
[SHK] dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed
[SHK] by the will of a dead father Is it not hard
[SHK] Nerissa that I can not choose one nor refuse none
[SHK] Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their
[SHK] death have good inspirations therefore the lottery
[SHK] that he hath devised in these three chests of gold
[SHK] silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
[SHK] chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any
[SHK] rightly but one who shall rightly love But what
[SHK] warmth is there in your affection towards any of
[SHK] these princely suitors that are already come
[SHK] I pray thee over-name them and as thou namest
[SHK] them I will describe them and according to my
[SHK] description level at my affection
[SHK] First there is the Neapolitan prince
[SHK] Ay that 's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but
[SHK] talk of his horse and he makes it a great
[SHK] appropriation to his own good parts that he can
[SHK] shoe him himself I am much afeard my lady his
[SHK] mother played false with a smith
[SHK] Then there is the County Palatine
[SHK] He doth nothing but frown as who should say 'If you
[SHK] will not have me choose he hears merry tales and
[SHK] smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping
[SHK] philosopher when he grows old being so full of
[SHK] unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be
[SHK] married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
[SHK] than to either of these God defend me from these
[SHK] two
[SHK] How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon
[SHK] God made him and therefore let him pass for a man
[SHK] In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but
[SHK] he why he hath a horse better than the
[SHK] Neapolitan 's a better bad habit of frowning than
[SHK] the Count Palatine he is every man in no man if a
[SHK] throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will
[SHK] fence with his own shadow if I should marry him I
[SHK] should marry twenty husbands If he would despise me
[SHK] I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I
[SHK] shall never requite him
[SHK] What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron
[SHK] of England
[SHK] You know I say nothing to him for he understands
[SHK] not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French
[SHK] nor Italian and you will come into the court and
[SHK] swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English
[SHK] He is a proper man 's picture but alas who can
[SHK] converse with a dumb-show How oddly he is suited
[SHK] I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round
[SHK] hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his
[SHK] behavior every where
[SHK] What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour
[SHK] That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he
[SHK] borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
[SHK] swore he would pay him again when he was able I
[SHK] think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
[SHK] under for another
[SHK] How like you the young German the Duke of Saxony 's nephew
[SHK] Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and
[SHK] most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when
[SHK] he is best he is a little worse than a man and
[SHK] when he is worst he is little better than a beast
[SHK] and the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall
[SHK] make shift to go without him
[SHK] If he should offer to choose and choose the right
[SHK] casket you should refuse to perform your father 's
[SHK] will if you should refuse to accept him
[SHK] Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a
[SHK] deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket
[SHK] for if the devil be within and that temptation
[SHK] without I know he will choose it I will do any
[SHK] thing Nerissa ere I 'll be married to a sponge
[SHK] You need not fear lady the having any of these
[SHK] lords they have acquainted me with their
[SHK] determinations which is indeed to return to their
[SHK] home and to trouble you with no more suit unless
[SHK] you may be won by some other sort than your father 's
[SHK] imposition depending on the caskets
[SHK] If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as
[SHK] chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner
[SHK] of my father 's will I am glad this parcel of wooers
[SHK] are so reasonable for there is not one among them
[SHK] but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant
[SHK] them a fair departure
[SHK] Do you not remember lady in your father 's time a
[SHK] Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither
[SHK] in company of the Marquis of Montferrat
[SHK] Yes yes it was Bassanio as I think he was so called
[SHK] True madam he of all the men that ever my foolish
[SHK] eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
[SHK] I remember him well and I remember him worthy of
[SHK] thy praise
[SHK] How now what news
[SHK] The four strangers seek for you madam to take
[SHK] their leave and there is a forerunner come from a
[SHK] fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the
[SHK] prince his master will be here to-night
[SHK] If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
[SHK] heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should
[SHK] be glad of his approach if he have the condition
[SHK] of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had
[SHK] rather he should shrive me than wive me Come
[SHK] Nerissa Sirrah go before
[SHK] Whiles we shut the gates
[SHK] upon one wooer another knocks at the door
[SHK] Three thousand ducats well
[SHK] Ay sir for three months
[SHK] For three months well
[SHK] For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound
[SHK] Antonio shall become bound well
[SHK] May you stead me will you pleasure me shall I
[SHK] know your answer
[SHK] Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound
[SHK] Your answer to that
[SHK] Antonio is a good man
[SHK] Have you heard any imputation to the contrary
[SHK] Oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a
[SHK] good man is to have you understand me that he is
[SHK] sufficient Yet his means are in supposition he
[SHK] hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the
[SHK] Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he
[SHK] hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and
[SHK] other ventures he hath squandered abroad But ships
[SHK] are but boards sailors but men there be land-rats
[SHK] and water-rats water-thieves and land-thieves I
[SHK] mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters
[SHK] winds and rocks The man is notwithstanding
[SHK] sufficient Three thousand ducats I think I may
[SHK] take his bond
[SHK] Be assured you may
[SHK] I will be assured I may and that I may be assured
[SHK] I will bethink me May I speak with Antonio
[SHK] If it please you to dine with us
[SHK] Yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which
[SHK] your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I
[SHK] will buy with you sell with you talk with you
[SHK] walk with you and so following but I will not eat
[SHK] with you drink with you nor pray with you What
[SHK] news on the Rialto Who is he comes here
[SHK] This is Signior Antonio
[SHK] I hate him for he is a Christian
[SHK] But more for that in low simplicity
[SHK] He lends out money gratis and brings down
[SHK] The rate of usance here with us in Venice
[SHK] If I can catch him once upon the hip
[SHK] I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him
[SHK] He hates our sacred nation and he rails
[SHK] Even there where merchants most do congregate
[SHK] On me my bargains and my well-won thrift
[SHK] Which he calls interest Cursed be my tribe
[SHK] If I forgive him
[SHK] Shylock do you hear
[SHK] I am debating of my present store
[SHK] And by the near guess of my memory
[SHK] I can not instantly raise up the gross
[SHK] Of full three thousand ducats What of that
[SHK] Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe
[SHK] Will furnish me But soft how many months
[SHK] Do you desire
[SHK] Rest you fair good signior
[SHK] Your worship was the last man in our mouths
[SHK] Shylock although I neither lend nor borrow
[SHK] By taking nor by giving of excess
[SHK] Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
[SHK] I 'll break a custom Is he yet possess 'd
[SHK] How much ye would
[SHK] Ay ay three thousand ducats
[SHK] And for three months
[SHK] I had forgot three months you told me so
[SHK] Well then your bond and let me see but hear you
[SHK] Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
[SHK] Upon advantage
[SHK] I do never use it
[SHK] When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban 's sheep --
[SHK] This Jacob from our holy Abram was
[SHK] As his wise mother wrought in his behalf
[SHK] The third possessor ay he was the third --
[SHK] And what of him did he take interest
[SHK] No not take interest not as you would say
[SHK] Directly interest mark what Jacob did
[SHK] When Laban and himself were compromised
[SHK] That all the eanlings which were streak 'd and pied
[SHK] Should fall as Jacob 's hire the ewes being rank
[SHK] In the end of autumn turned to the rams
[SHK] And when the work of generation was
[SHK] Between these woolly breeders in the act
[SHK] The skilful shepherd peel 'd me certain wands
[SHK] And in the doing of the deed of kind
[SHK] He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
[SHK] Who then conceiving did in eaning time
[SHK] Fall parti-colour 'd lambs and those were Jacob 's
[SHK] This was a way to thrive and he was blest
[SHK] And thrift is blessing if men steal it not
[SHK] This was a venture sir that Jacob served for
[SHK] A thing not in his power to bring to pass
[SHK] But sway 'd and fashion 'd by the hand of heaven
[SHK] Was this inserted to make interest good
[SHK] Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
[SHK] I can not tell I make it breed as fast
[SHK] But note me signior
[SHK] Mark you this Bassanio
[SHK] The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose
[SHK] An evil soul producing holy witness
[SHK] Is like a villain with a smiling cheek
[SHK] A goodly apple rotten at the heart
[SHK] O what a goodly outside falsehood hath
[SHK] Three thousand ducats 't is a good round sum
[SHK] Three months from twelve then let me see the rate --
[SHK] Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you
[SHK] Signior Antonio many a time and oft
[SHK] In the Rialto you have rated me
[SHK] About my moneys and my usances
[SHK] Still have I borne it with a patient shrug
[SHK] For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe
[SHK] You call me misbeliever cut-throat dog
[SHK] And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine
[SHK] And all for use of that which is mine own
[SHK] Well then it now appears you need my help
[SHK] Go to then you come to me and you say
[SHK] 'Shylock we would have moneys you say so
[SHK] You that did void your rheum upon my beard
[SHK] And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
[SHK] Over your threshold moneys is your suit
[SHK] What should I say to you Should I not say
[SHK] 'Hath a dog money is it possible
[SHK] A cur can lend three thousand ducats Or
[SHK] Shall I bend low and in a bondman 's key
[SHK] With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this
[SHK] 'Fair sir you spit on me on Wednesday last
[SHK] You spurn 'd me such a day another time
[SHK] You call 'd me dog and for these courtesies
[SHK] I 'll lend you thus much moneys
[SHK] I am as like to call thee so again
[SHK] To spit on thee again to spurn thee too
[SHK] If thou wilt lend this money lend it not
[SHK] As to thy friends for when did friendship take
[SHK] A breed for barren metal of his friend
[SHK] But lend it rather to thine enemy
[SHK] Who if he break thou mayst with better face
[SHK] Exact the penalty
[SHK] Why look you how you storm
[SHK] I would be friends with you and have your love
[SHK] Forget the shames that you have stain 'd me with
[SHK] Supply your present wants and take no doit
[SHK] Of usance for my moneys and you 'll not hear me
[SHK] This is kind I offer
[SHK] This were kindness
[SHK] This kindness will I show
[SHK] Go with me to a notary seal me there
[SHK] Your single bond and in a merry sport
[SHK] If you repay me not on such a day
[SHK] In such a place such sum or sums as are
[SHK] Express 'd in the condition let the forfeit
[SHK] Be nominated for an equal pound
[SHK] Of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
[SHK] In what part of your body pleaseth me
[SHK] Content i faith I 'll seal to such a bond
[SHK] And say there is much kindness in the Jew
[SHK] You shall not seal to such a bond for me
[SHK] I 'll rather dwell in my necessity
[SHK] Why fear not man I will not forfeit it
[SHK] Within these two months that 's a month before
[SHK] This bond expires I do expect return
[SHK] Of thrice three times the value of this bond
[SHK] O father Abram what these Christians are
[SHK] Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
[SHK] The thoughts of others Pray you tell me this
[SHK] If he should break his day what should I gain
[SHK] By the exaction of the forfeiture
[SHK] A pound of man 's flesh taken from a man
[SHK] Is not so estimable profitable neither
[SHK] As flesh of muttons beefs or goats I say
[SHK] To buy his favour I extend this friendship
[SHK] If he will take it so if not adieu
[SHK] And for my love I pray you wrong me not
[SHK] Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond
[SHK] Then meet me forthwith at the notary 's
[SHK] Give him direction for this merry bond
[SHK] And I will go and purse the ducats straight
[SHK] See to my house left in the fearful guard
[SHK] Of an unthrifty knave and presently
[SHK] I will be with you
[SHK] Hie thee gentle Jew
[SHK] The Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind
[SHK] I like not fair terms and a villain 's mind
[SHK] Come on in this there can be no dismay
[SHK] My ships come home a month before the day
[SHK] Mislike me not for my complexion
[SHK] The shadow 'd livery of the burnish 'd sun
[SHK] To whom I am a neighbour and near bred
[SHK] Bring me the fairest creature northward born
[SHK] Where Phoebus fire scarce thaws the icicles
[SHK] And let us make incision for your love
[SHK] To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
[SHK] I tell thee lady this aspect of mine
[SHK] Hath fear 'd the valiant by my love I swear
[SHK] The best-regarded virgins of our clime
[SHK] Have loved it too I would not change this hue
[SHK] Except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
[SHK] In terms of choice I am not solely led
[SHK] By nice direction of a maiden 's eyes
[SHK] Besides the lottery of my destiny
[SHK] Bars me the right of voluntary choosing
[SHK] But if my father had not scanted me
[SHK] And hedged me by his wit to yield myself
[SHK] His wife who wins me by that means I told you
[SHK] Yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
[SHK] As any comer I have look 'd on yet
[SHK] For my affection
[SHK] Even for that I thank you
[SHK] Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets
[SHK] To try my fortune By this scimitar
[SHK] That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
[SHK] That won three fields of Sultan Solyman
[SHK] I would outstare the sternest eyes that look
[SHK] Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
[SHK] Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear
[SHK] Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey
[SHK] To win thee lady But alas the while
[SHK] If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
[SHK] Which is the better man the greater throw
[SHK] May turn by fortune from the weaker hand
[SHK] So is Alcides beaten by his page
[SHK] And so may I blind fortune leading me
[SHK] Miss that which one unworthier may attain
[SHK] And die with grieving
[SHK] You must take your chance
[SHK] And either not attempt to choose at all
[SHK] Or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
[SHK] Never to speak to lady afterward
[SHK] In way of marriage therefore be advised
[SHK] Nor will not Come bring me unto my chance
[SHK] First forward to the temple after dinner
[SHK] Your hazard shall be made
[SHK] Good fortune then
[SHK] To make me blest or cursed'st among men
[SHK] Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
[SHK] this Jew my master The fiend is at mine elbow and
[SHK] tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good
[SHK] Launcelot or 'good Gobbo or good Launcelot
[SHK] Gobbo use your legs take the start run away My
[SHK] conscience says 'No take heed honest Launcelot
[SHK] take heed honest Gobbo or as aforesaid 'honest
[SHK] Launcelot Gobbo do not run scorn running with thy
[SHK] heels Well the most courageous fiend bids me
[SHK] pack 'Via says the fiend 'away says the
[SHK] fiend 'for the heavens rouse up a brave mind
[SHK] says the fiend 'and run Well my conscience
[SHK] hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely
[SHK] to me 'My honest friend Launcelot being an honest
[SHK] man 's son or rather an honest woman 's son for
[SHK] indeed my father did something smack something
[SHK] grow to he had a kind of taste well my conscience
[SHK] says 'Launcelot budge not 'Budge says the
[SHK] fiend 'Budge not says my conscience
[SHK] 'Conscience say I 'you counsel well Fiend
[SHK] say I 'you counsel well to be ruled by my
[SHK] conscience I should stay with the Jew my master
[SHK] who God bless the mark is a kind of devil and to
[SHK] run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the
[SHK] fiend who saving your reverence is the devil
[SHK] himself Certainly the Jew is the very devil
[SHK] incarnal and in my conscience my conscience is
[SHK] but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
[SHK] me to stay with the Jew The fiend gives the more
[SHK] friendly counsel I will run fiend my heels are
[SHK] at your command I will run
[SHK] Master young man you I pray you which is the way
[SHK] to master Jew 's
[SHK] who being more than sand-blind high-gravel blind
[SHK] knows me not I will try confusions with him
[SHK] Master young gentleman I pray you which is the way
[SHK] to master Jew 's
[SHK] Turn up on your right hand at the next turning but
[SHK] at the next turning of all on your left marry at
[SHK] the very next turning turn of no hand but turn
[SHK] down indirectly to the Jew 's house
[SHK] By God 's sonties 'twill be a hard way to hit Can
[SHK] you tell me whether one Launcelot
[SHK] that dwells with him dwell with him or no
[SHK] Talk you of young Master Launcelot
[SHK] Mark me now now will I raise the waters Talk you
[SHK] of young Master Launcelot
[SHK] No master sir but a poor man 's son his father
[SHK] though I say it is an honest exceeding poor man
[SHK] and God be thanked well to live
[SHK] Well let his father be what a will we talk of
[SHK] young Master Launcelot
[SHK] Your worship 's friend and Launcelot sir
[SHK] But I pray you ergo old man ergo I beseech you
[SHK] talk you of young Master Launcelot
[SHK] Of Launcelot a n't please your mastership
[SHK] Ergo Master Launcelot Talk not of Master
[SHK] Launcelot father for the young gentleman
[SHK] according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
[SHK] sayings the Sisters Three and such branches of
[SHK] learning is indeed deceased or as you would say
[SHK] in plain terms gone to heaven
[SHK] Marry God forbid the boy was the very staff of my
[SHK] age my very prop
[SHK] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post a staff or
[SHK] a prop Do you know me father
[SHK] Alack the day I know you not young gentleman
[SHK] but I pray you tell me is my boy God rest his
[SHK] soul alive or dead
[SHK] Do you not know me father
[SHK] Alack sir I am sand-blind I know you not
[SHK] Nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of
[SHK] the knowing me it is a wise father that knows his
[SHK] own child Well old man I will tell you news of
[SHK] your son give me your blessing truth will come
[SHK] to light murder can not be hid long a man 's son
[SHK] may but at the length truth will out
[SHK] Pray you sir stand up I am sure you are not
[SHK] Launcelot my boy
[SHK] Pray you let 's have no more fooling about it but
[SHK] give me your blessing I am Launcelot your boy
[SHK] that was your son that is your child that shall
[SHK] be
[SHK] I can not think you are my son
[SHK] I know not what I shall think of that but I am
[SHK] Launcelot the Jew 's man and I am sure Margery your
[SHK] wife is my mother
[SHK] Her name is Margery indeed I 'll be sworn if thou
[SHK] be Launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood
[SHK] Lord worshipped might he be what a beard hast thou
[SHK] got thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
[SHK] Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail
[SHK] It should seem then that Dobbin 's tail grows
[SHK] backward I am sure he had more hair of his tail
[SHK] than I have of my face when I last saw him
[SHK] Lord how art thou changed How dost thou and thy
[SHK] master agree I have brought him a present How
[SHK] 'gree you now
[SHK] Well well but for mine own part as I have set
[SHK] up my rest to run away so I will not rest till I
[SHK] have run some ground My master 's a very Jew give
[SHK] him a present give him a halter I am famished in
[SHK] his service you may tell every finger I have with
[SHK] my ribs Father I am glad you are come give me
[SHK] your present to one Master Bassanio who indeed
[SHK] gives rare new liveries if I serve not him I
[SHK] will run as far as God has any ground O rare
[SHK] fortune here comes the man to him father for I
[SHK] am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer
[SHK] You may do so but let it be so hasted that supper
[SHK] be ready at the farthest by five of the clock See
[SHK] these letters delivered put the liveries to making
[SHK] and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging
[SHK] To him father
[SHK] God bless your worship
[SHK] Gramercy wouldst thou aught with me
[SHK] Here 's my son sir a poor boy --
[SHK] Not a poor boy sir but the rich Jew 's man that
[SHK] would sir as my father shall specify --
[SHK] He hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve --
[SHK] Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew
[SHK] and have a desire as my father shall specify --
[SHK] His master and he saving your worship 's reverence
[SHK] are scarce cater-cousins --
[SHK] To be brief the very truth is that the Jew having
[SHK] done me wrong doth cause me as my father being I
[SHK] hope an old man shall frutify unto you --
[SHK] I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
[SHK] your worship and my suit is --
[SHK] In very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as
[SHK] your worship shall know by this honest old man and
[SHK] though I say it though old man yet poor man my father
[SHK] One speak for both What would you
[SHK] Serve you sir
[SHK] That is the very defect of the matter sir
[SHK] I know thee well thou hast obtain 'd thy suit
[SHK] Shylock thy master spoke with me this day
[SHK] And hath preferr 'd thee if it be preferment
[SHK] To leave a rich Jew 's service to become
[SHK] The follower of so poor a gentleman
[SHK] The old proverb is very well parted between my
[SHK] master Shylock and you sir you have the grace of
[SHK] God sir and he hath enough
[SHK] Thou speak'st it well Go father with thy son
[SHK] Take leave of thy old master and inquire
[SHK] My lodging out Give him a livery
[SHK] More guarded than his fellows see it done
[SHK] Father in I can not get a service no I have
[SHK] ne'er a tongue in my head Well if any man in
[SHK] Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
[SHK] upon a book I shall have good fortune Go to
[SHK] here 's a simple line of life here 's a small trifle
[SHK] of wives alas fifteen wives is nothing eleven
[SHK] widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
[SHK] man and then to 'scape drowning thrice and to be
[SHK] in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed
[SHK] here are simple scapes Well if Fortune be a
[SHK] woman she 's a good wench for this gear Father
[SHK] come I 'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye
[SHK] I pray thee good Leonardo think on this
[SHK] These things being bought and orderly bestow 'd
[SHK] Return in haste for I do feast to-night
[SHK] My best-esteem 'd acquaintance hie thee go
[SHK] My best endeavours shall be done herein
[SHK] Where is your master
[SHK] Yonder sir he walks
[SHK] Signior Bassanio
[SHK] Gratiano
[SHK] I have a suit to you
[SHK] You have obtain 'd it
[SHK] You must not deny me I must go with you to Belmont
[SHK] Why then you must But hear thee Gratiano
[SHK] Thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice
[SHK] Parts that become thee happily enough
[SHK] And in such eyes as ours appear not faults
[SHK] But where thou art not known why there they show
[SHK] Something too liberal Pray thee take pain
[SHK] To allay with some cold drops of modesty
[SHK] Thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior
[SHK] I be misconstrued in the place I go to
[SHK] And lose my hopes
[SHK] Signior Bassanio hear me
[SHK] If I do not put on a sober habit
[SHK] Talk with respect and swear but now and then
[SHK] Wear prayer-books in my pocket look demurely
[SHK] Nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes
[SHK] Thus with my hat and sigh and say 'amen
[SHK] Use all the observance of civility
[SHK] Like one well studied in a sad ostent
[SHK] To please his grandam never trust me more
[SHK] Well we shall see your bearing
[SHK] Nay but I bar to-night you shall not gauge me
[SHK] By what we do to-night
[SHK] No that were pity
[SHK] I would entreat you rather to put on
[SHK] Your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends
[SHK] That purpose merriment But fare you well
[SHK] I have some business
[SHK] And I must to Lorenzo and the rest
[SHK] But we will visit you at supper-time
[SHK] I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so
[SHK] Our house is hell and thou a merry devil
[SHK] Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness
[SHK] But fare thee well there is a ducat for thee
[SHK] And Launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see
[SHK] Lorenzo who is thy new master 's guest
[SHK] Give him this letter do it secretly
[SHK] And so farewell I would not have my father
[SHK] See me in talk with thee
[SHK] Adieu tears exhibit my tongue Most beautiful
[SHK] pagan most sweet Jew if a Christian did not play
[SHK] the knave and get thee I am much deceived But
[SHK] adieu these foolish drops do something drown my
[SHK] manly spirit adieu
[SHK] Farewell good Launcelot
[SHK] Alack what heinous sin is it in me
[SHK] To be ashamed to be my father 's child
[SHK] But though I am a daughter to his blood
[SHK] I am not to his manners O Lorenzo
[SHK] If thou keep promise I shall end this strife
[SHK] Become a Christian and thy loving wife
[SHK] Nay we will slink away in supper-time
[SHK] Disguise us at my lodging and return
[SHK] All in an hour
[SHK] We have not made good preparation
[SHK] We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers
[SHK] 'T is vile unless it may be quaintly order 'd
[SHK] And better in my mind not undertook
[SHK] 'T is now but four o'clock we have two hours
[SHK] To furnish us
[SHK] Friend Launcelot what 's the news
[SHK] An it shall please you to break up
[SHK] this it shall seem to signify
[SHK] I know the hand in faith 't is a fair hand
[SHK] And whiter than the paper it writ on
[SHK] Is the fair hand that writ
[SHK] Love-news in faith
[SHK] By your leave sir
[SHK] Whither goest thou
[SHK] Marry sir to bid my old master the
[SHK] Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian
[SHK] Hold here take this tell gentle Jessica
[SHK] I will not fail her speak it privately
[SHK] Go gentlemen
[SHK] Will you prepare you for this masque tonight
[SHK] I am provided of a torch-bearer
[SHK] Ay marry I 'll be gone about it straight
[SHK] And so will I
[SHK] Meet me and Gratiano
[SHK] At Gratiano 's lodging some hour hence
[SHK] 'T is good we do so
[SHK] Was not that letter from fair Jessica
[SHK] I must needs tell thee all She hath directed
[SHK] How I shall take her from her father 's house
[SHK] What gold and jewels she is furnish 'd with
[SHK] What page 's suit she hath in readiness
[SHK] If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven
[SHK] It will be for his gentle daughter 's sake
[SHK] And never dare misfortune cross her foot
[SHK] Unless she do it under this excuse
[SHK] That she is issue to a faithless Jew
[SHK] Come go with me peruse this as thou goest
[SHK] Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer
[SHK] Well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge
[SHK] The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio --
[SHK] What Jessica -- thou shalt not gormandise
[SHK] As thou hast done with me -- What Jessica --
[SHK] And sleep and snore and rend apparel out --
[SHK] Why Jessica I say
[SHK] Why Jessica
[SHK] Who bids thee call I do not bid thee call
[SHK] Your worship was wont to tell me that
[SHK] I could do nothing without bidding
[SHK] Call you what is your will
[SHK] I am bid forth to supper Jessica
[SHK] There are my keys But wherefore should I go
[SHK] I am not bid for love they flatter me
[SHK] But yet I 'll go in hate to feed upon
[SHK] The prodigal Christian Jessica my girl
[SHK] Look to my house I am right loath to go
[SHK] There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest
[SHK] For I did dream of money-bags to-night
[SHK] I beseech you sir go my young master doth expect
[SHK] your reproach
[SHK] So do I his
[SHK] An they have conspired together I will not say you
[SHK] shall see a masque but if you do then it was not
[SHK] for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
[SHK] Black-Monday last at six o'clock i the morning
[SHK] falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
[SHK] year in the afternoon
[SHK] What are there masques Hear you me Jessica
[SHK] Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum
[SHK] And the vile squealing of the wry-neck 'd fife
[SHK] Clamber not you up to the casements then
[SHK] Nor thrust your head into the public street
[SHK] To gaze on Christian fools with varnish 'd faces
[SHK] But stop my house 's ears I mean my casements
[SHK] Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
[SHK] My sober house By Jacob 's staff I swear
[SHK] I have no mind of feasting forth to-night
[SHK] But I will go Go you before me sirrah
[SHK] Say I will come
[SHK] I will go before sir Mistress look out at
[SHK] window for all this There will come a Christian
[SHK] boy will be worth a Jewess eye
[SHK] What says that fool of Hagar 's offspring ha
[SHK] His words were 'Farewell mistress nothing else
[SHK] The patch is kind enough but a huge feeder
[SHK] Snail-slow in profit and he sleeps by day
[SHK] More than the wild-cat drones hive not with me
[SHK] Therefore I part with him and part with him
[SHK] To one that would have him help to waste
[SHK] His borrow 'd purse Well Jessica go in
[SHK] Perhaps I will return immediately
[SHK] Do as I bid you shut doors after you
[SHK] Fast bind fast find
[SHK] A proverb never stale in thrifty mind
[SHK] Farewell and if my fortune be not crost
[SHK] I have a father you a daughter lost
[SHK] This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
[SHK] Desired us to make stand
[SHK] His hour is almost past
[SHK] And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour
[SHK] For lovers ever run before the clock
[SHK] O ten times faster Venus pigeons fly
[SHK] To seal love 's bonds new-made than they are wont
[SHK] To keep obliged faith unforfeited
[SHK] That ever holds who riseth from a feast
[SHK] With that keen appetite that he sits down
[SHK] Where is the horse that doth untread again
[SHK] His tedious measures with the unbated fire
[SHK] That he did pace them first All things that are
[SHK] Are with more spirit chased than enjoy 'd
[SHK] How like a younker or a prodigal
[SHK] The scarfed bark puts from her native bay
[SHK] Hugg 'd and embraced by the strumpet wind
[SHK] How like the prodigal doth she return
[SHK] With over-weather 'd ribs and ragged sails
[SHK] Lean rent and beggar 'd by the strumpet wind
[SHK] Here comes Lorenzo more of this hereafter
[SHK] Sweet friends your patience for my long abode
[SHK] Not I but my affairs have made you wait
[SHK] When you shall please to play the thieves for wives
[SHK] I 'll watch as long for you then Approach
[SHK] Here dwells my father Jew Ho who 's within
[SHK] Who are you Tell me for more certainty
[SHK] Albeit I 'll swear that I do know your tongue
[SHK] Lorenzo and thy love
[SHK] Lorenzo certain and my love indeed
[SHK] For who love I so much And now who knows
[SHK] But you Lorenzo whether I am yours
[SHK] Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
[SHK] Here catch this casket it is worth the pains
[SHK] I am glad 't is night you do not look on me
[SHK] For I am much ashamed of my exchange
[SHK] But love is blind and lovers can not see
[SHK] The pretty follies that themselves commit
[SHK] For if they could Cupid himself would blush
[SHK] To see me thus transformed to a boy
[SHK] Descend for you must be my torchbearer
[SHK] What must I hold a candle to my shames
[SHK] They in themselves good-sooth are too too light
[SHK] Why 't is an office of discovery love
[SHK] And I should be obscured
[SHK] So are you sweet
[SHK] Even in the lovely garnish of a boy
[SHK] But come at once
[SHK] For the close night doth play the runaway
[SHK] And we are stay 'd for at Bassanio 's feast
[SHK] I will make fast the doors and gild myself
[SHK] With some more ducats and be with you straight
[SHK] Now by my hood a Gentile and no Jew
[SHK] Beshrew me but I love her heartily
[SHK] For she is wise if I can judge of her
[SHK] And fair she is if that mine eyes be true
[SHK] And true she is as she hath proved herself
[SHK] And therefore like herself wise fair and true
[SHK] Shall she be placed in my constant soul
[SHK] What art thou come On gentlemen away
[SHK] Our masquing mates by this time for us stay
[SHK] Who 's there
[SHK] Signior Antonio
[SHK] Fie fie Gratiano where are all the rest
[SHK] 'T is nine o'clock our friends all stay for you
[SHK] No masque to-night the wind is come about
[SHK] Bassanio presently will go aboard
[SHK] I have sent twenty out to seek for you
[SHK] I am glad o n't I desire no more delight
[SHK] Than to be under sail and gone to-night
[SHK] Go draw aside the curtains and discover
[SHK] The several caskets to this noble prince
[SHK] Now make your choice
[SHK] The first of gold who this inscription bears
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
[SHK] The second silver which this promise carries
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
[SHK] This third dull lead with warning all as blunt
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
[SHK] How shall I know if I do choose the right
[SHK] The one of them contains my picture prince
[SHK] If you choose that then I am yours withal
[SHK] Some god direct my judgment Let me see
[SHK] I will survey the inscriptions back again
[SHK] What says this leaden casket
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
[SHK] Must give for what for lead hazard for lead
[SHK] This casket threatens Men that hazard all
[SHK] Do it in hope of fair advantages
[SHK] A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
[SHK] I 'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
[SHK] What says the silver with her virgin hue
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
[SHK] As much as he deserves Pause there Morocco
[SHK] And weigh thy value with an even hand
[SHK] If thou be'st rated by thy estimation
[SHK] Thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
[SHK] May not extend so far as to the lady
[SHK] And yet to be afeard of my deserving
[SHK] Were but a weak disabling of myself
[SHK] As much as I deserve Why that 's the lady
[SHK] I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
[SHK] In graces and in qualities of breeding
[SHK] But more than these in love I do deserve
[SHK] What if I stray 'd no further but chose here
[SHK] Let 's see once more this saying graved in gold
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
[SHK] Why that 's the lady all the world desires her
[SHK] From the four corners of the earth they come
[SHK] To kiss this shrine this mortal-breathing saint
[SHK] The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
[SHK] Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
[SHK] For princes to come view fair Portia
[SHK] The watery kingdom whose ambitious head
[SHK] Spits in the face of heaven is no bar
[SHK] To stop the foreign spirits but they come
[SHK] As o'er a brook to see fair Portia
[SHK] One of these three contains her heavenly picture
[SHK] Is't like that lead contains her 'Twere damnation
[SHK] To think so base a thought it were too gross
[SHK] To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
[SHK] Or shall I think in silver she 's immured
[SHK] Being ten times undervalued to tried gold
[SHK] O sinful thought Never so rich a gem
[SHK] Was set in worse than gold They have in England
[SHK] A coin that bears the figure of an angel
[SHK] Stamped in gold but that 's insculp 'd upon
[SHK] But here an angel in a golden bed
[SHK] Lies all within Deliver me the key
[SHK] Here do I choose and thrive I as I may
[SHK] There take it prince and if my form lie there
[SHK] Then I am yours
[SHK] O hell what have we here
[SHK] A carrion Death within whose empty eye
[SHK] There is a written scroll I 'll read the writing
[SHK] All that glitters is not gold
[SHK] Often have you heard that told
[SHK] Many a man his life hath sold
[SHK] But my outside to behold
[SHK] Gilded tombs do worms enfold
[SHK] Had you been as wise as bold
[SHK] Young in limbs in judgment old
[SHK] Your answer had not been inscroll 'd
[SHK] Fare you well your suit is cold
[SHK] Cold indeed and labour lost
[SHK] Then farewell heat and welcome frost
[SHK] Portia adieu I have too grieved a heart
[SHK] To take a tedious leave thus losers part
[SHK] A gentle riddance Draw the curtains go
[SHK] Let all of his complexion choose me so
[SHK] Why man I saw Bassanio under sail
[SHK] With him is Gratiano gone along
[SHK] And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
[SHK] The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke
[SHK] Who went with him to search Bassanio 's ship
[SHK] He came too late the ship was under sail
[SHK] But there the duke was given to understand
[SHK] That in a gondola were seen together
[SHK] Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica
[SHK] Besides Antonio certified the duke
[SHK] They were not with Bassanio in his ship
[SHK] I never heard a passion so confused
[SHK] So strange outrageous and so variable
[SHK] As the dog Jew did utter in the streets
[SHK] 'My daughter O my ducats O my daughter
[SHK] Fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats
[SHK] Justice the law my ducats and my daughter
[SHK] A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
[SHK] Of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter
[SHK] And jewels two stones two rich and precious stones
[SHK] Stolen by my daughter Justice find the girl
[SHK] She hath the stones upon her and the ducats
[SHK] Why all the boys in Venice follow him
[SHK] Crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
[SHK] Let good Antonio look he keep his day
[SHK] Or he shall pay for this
[SHK] Marry well remember 'd
[SHK] I reason 'd with a Frenchman yesterday
[SHK] Who told me in the narrow seas that part
[SHK] The French and English there miscarried
[SHK] A vessel of our country richly fraught
[SHK] I thought upon Antonio when he told me
[SHK] And wish 'd in silence that it were not his
[SHK] You were best to tell Antonio what you hear
[SHK] Yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
[SHK] A kinder gentleman treads not the earth
[SHK] I saw Bassanio and Antonio part
[SHK] Bassanio told him he would make some speed
[SHK] Of his return he answer 'd 'Do not so
[SHK] Slubber not business for my sake Bassanio
[SHK] But stay the very riping of the time
[SHK] And for the Jew 's bond which he hath of me
[SHK] Let it not enter in your mind of love
[SHK] Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
[SHK] To courtship and such fair ostents of love
[SHK] As shall conveniently become you there
[SHK] And even there his eye being big with tears
[SHK] Turning his face he put his hand behind him
[SHK] And with affection wondrous sensible
[SHK] He wrung Bassanio 's hand and so they parted
[SHK] I think he only loves the world for him
[SHK] I pray thee let us go and find him out
[SHK] And quicken his embraced heaviness
[SHK] With some delight or other
[SHK] Do we so
[SHK] Quick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straight
[SHK] The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath
[SHK] And comes to his election presently
[SHK] Behold there stand the caskets noble prince
[SHK] If you choose that wherein I am contain 'd
[SHK] Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized
[SHK] But if you fail without more speech my lord
[SHK] You must be gone from hence immediately
[SHK] I am enjoin 'd by oath to observe three things
[SHK] First never to unfold to any one
[SHK] Which casket 't was I chose next if I fail
[SHK] Of the right casket never in my life
[SHK] To woo a maid in way of marriage Lastly
[SHK] If I do fail in fortune of my choice
[SHK] Immediately to leave you and be gone
[SHK] To these injunctions every one doth swear
[SHK] That comes to hazard for my worthless self
[SHK] And so have I address 'd me Fortune now
[SHK] To my heart 's hope Gold silver and base lead
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
[SHK] You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard
[SHK] What says the golden chest ha let me see
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
[SHK] What many men desire that 'many may be meant
[SHK] By the fool multitude that choose by show
[SHK] Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
[SHK] Which pries not to the interior but like the martlet
[SHK] Builds in the weather on the outward wall
[SHK] Even in the force and road of casualty
[SHK] I will not choose what many men desire
[SHK] Because I will not jump with common spirits
[SHK] And rank me with the barbarous multitudes
[SHK] Why then to thee thou silver treasure-house
[SHK] Tell me once more what title thou dost bear
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
[SHK] And well said too for who shall go about
[SHK] To cozen fortune and be honourable
[SHK] Without the stamp of merit Let none presume
[SHK] To wear an undeserved dignity
[SHK] O that estates degrees and offices
[SHK] Were not derived corruptly and that clear honour
[SHK] Were purchased by the merit of the wearer
[SHK] How many then should cover that stand bare
[SHK] How many be commanded that command
[SHK] How much low peasantry would then be glean 'd
[SHK] From the true seed of honour and how much honour
[SHK] Pick 'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
[SHK] To be new-varnish 'd Well but to my choice
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
[SHK] I will assume desert Give me a key for this
[SHK] And instantly unlock my fortunes here
[SHK] Too long a pause for that which you find there
[SHK] What 's here the portrait of a blinking idiot
[SHK] Presenting me a schedule I will read it
[SHK] How much unlike art thou to Portia
[SHK] How much unlike my hopes and my deservings
[SHK] 'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves
[SHK] Did I deserve no more than a fool 's head
[SHK] Is that my prize are my deserts no better
[SHK] To offend and judge are distinct offices
[SHK] And of opposed natures
[SHK] What is here
[SHK] The fire seven times tried this
[SHK] Seven times tried that judgment is
[SHK] That did never choose amiss
[SHK] Some there be that shadows kiss
[SHK] Such have but a shadow 's bliss
[SHK] There be fools alive I wis
[SHK] Silver 'd o'er and so was this
[SHK] Take what wife you will to bed
[SHK] I will ever be your head
[SHK] So be gone you are sped
[SHK] Still more fool I shall appear
[SHK] By the time I linger here
[SHK] With one fool 's head I came to woo
[SHK] But I go away with two
[SHK] Sweet adieu I 'll keep my oath
[SHK] Patiently to bear my wroth
[SHK] Thus hath the candle singed the moth
[SHK] O these deliberate fools when they do choose
[SHK] They have the wisdom by their wit to lose
[SHK] The ancient saying is no heresy
[SHK] Hanging and wiving goes by destiny
[SHK] Come draw the curtain Nerissa
[SHK] Where is my lady
[SHK] Here what would my lord
[SHK] Madam there is alighted at your gate
[SHK] A young Venetian one that comes before
[SHK] To signify the approaching of his lord
[SHK] From whom he bringeth sensible regreets
[SHK] To wit besides commends and courteous breath
[SHK] Gifts of rich value Yet I have not seen
[SHK] So likely an ambassador of love
[SHK] A day in April never came so sweet
[SHK] To show how costly summer was at hand
[SHK] As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord
[SHK] No more I pray thee I am half afeard
[SHK] Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee
[SHK] Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him
[SHK] Come come Nerissa for I long to see
[SHK] Quick Cupid 's post that comes so mannerly
[SHK] Bassanio lord Love if thy will it be
[SHK] Now what news on the Rialto
[SHK] Why yet it lives there uncheck 'd that Antonio hath
[SHK] a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas
[SHK] the Goodwins I think they call the place a very
[SHK] dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many
[SHK] a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip
[SHK] Report be an honest woman of her word
[SHK] I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
[SHK] knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
[SHK] wept for the death of a third husband But it is
[SHK] true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
[SHK] plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the
[SHK] honest Antonio -- O that I had a title good enough
[SHK] to keep his name company --
[SHK] Come the full stop
[SHK] Ha what sayest thou Why the end is he hath
[SHK] lost a ship
[SHK] I would it might prove the end of his losses
[SHK] Let me say 'amen betimes lest the devil cross my
[SHK] prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew
[SHK] How now Shylock what news among the merchants
[SHK] You know none so well none so well as you of my
[SHK] daughter 's flight
[SHK] That 's certain I for my part knew the tailor
[SHK] that made the wings she flew withal
[SHK] And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was
[SHK] fledged and then it is the complexion of them all
[SHK] to leave the dam
[SHK] She is damned for it
[SHK] That 's certain if the devil may be her judge
[SHK] My own flesh and blood to rebel
[SHK] Out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years
[SHK] I say my daughter is my flesh and blood
[SHK] There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
[SHK] than between jet and ivory more between your bloods
[SHK] than there is between red wine and rhenish But
[SHK] tell us do you hear whether Antonio have had any
[SHK] loss at sea or no
[SHK] There I have another bad match a bankrupt a
[SHK] prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the
[SHK] Rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon
[SHK] the mart let him look to his bond he was wont to
[SHK] call me usurer let him look to his bond he was
[SHK] wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy let him
[SHK] look to his bond
[SHK] Why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take
[SHK] his flesh what 's that good for
[SHK] To bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else
[SHK] it will feed my revenge He hath disgraced me and
[SHK] hindered me half a million laughed at my losses
[SHK] mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my
[SHK] bargains cooled my friends heated mine
[SHK] enemies and what 's his reason I am a Jew Hath
[SHK] not a Jew eyes hath not a Jew hands organs
[SHK] dimensions senses affections passions fed with
[SHK] the same food hurt with the same weapons subject
[SHK] to the same diseases healed by the same means
[SHK] warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as
[SHK] a Christian is If you prick us do we not bleed
[SHK] if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison
[SHK] us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not
[SHK] revenge If we are like you in the rest we will
[SHK] resemble you in that If a Jew wrong a Christian
[SHK] what is his humility Revenge If a Christian
[SHK] wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be by
[SHK] Christian example Why revenge The villany you
[SHK] teach me I will execute and it shall go hard but I
[SHK] will better the instruction
[SHK] Gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and
[SHK] desires to speak with you both
[SHK] We have been up and down to seek him
[SHK] Here comes another of the tribe a third can not be
[SHK] matched unless the devil himself turn Jew
[SHK] How now Tubal what news from Genoa hast thou
[SHK] found my daughter
[SHK] I often came where I did hear of her but can not find her
[SHK] Why there there there there a diamond gone
[SHK] cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort The curse
[SHK] never fell upon our nation till now I never felt it
[SHK] till now two thousand ducats in that and other
[SHK] precious precious jewels I would my daughter
[SHK] were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear
[SHK] would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in
[SHK] her coffin No news of them Why so and I know
[SHK] not what 's spent in the search why thou loss upon
[SHK] loss the thief gone with so much and so much to
[SHK] find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge
[SHK] nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
[SHK] shoulders no sighs but of my breathing no tears
[SHK] but of my shedding
[SHK] Yes other men have ill luck too Antonio as I
[SHK] heard in Genoa --
[SHK] What what what ill luck ill luck
[SHK] Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis
[SHK] I thank God I thank God Is't true is't true
[SHK] I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck
[SHK] I thank thee good Tubal good news good news
[SHK] ha ha where in Genoa
[SHK] Your daughter spent in Genoa as I heard in one
[SHK] night fourscore ducats
[SHK] Thou stickest a dagger in me I shall never see my
[SHK] gold again fourscore ducats at a sitting
[SHK] fourscore ducats
[SHK] There came divers of Antonio 's creditors in my
[SHK] company to Venice that swear he can not choose but break
[SHK] I am very glad of it I 'll plague him I 'll torture
[SHK] him I am glad of it
[SHK] One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
[SHK] daughter for a monkey
[SHK] Out upon her Thou torturest me Tubal it was my
[SHK] turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor
[SHK] I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys
[SHK] But Antonio is certainly undone
[SHK] Nay that 's true that 's very true Go Tubal fee
[SHK] me an officer bespeak him a fortnight before I
[SHK] will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were
[SHK] he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I
[SHK] will Go go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue
[SHK] go good Tubal at our synagogue Tubal
[SHK] I pray you tarry pause a day or two
[SHK] Before you hazard for in choosing wrong
[SHK] I lose your company therefore forbear awhile
[SHK] There 's something tells me but it is not love
[SHK] I would not lose you and you know yourself
[SHK] Hate counsels not in such a quality
[SHK] But lest you should not understand me well --
[SHK] And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought --
[SHK] I would detain you here some month or two
[SHK] Before you venture for me I could teach you
[SHK] How to choose right but I am then forsworn
[SHK] So will I never be so may you miss me
[SHK] But if you do you 'll make me wish a sin
[SHK] That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes
[SHK] They have o'erlook 'd me and divided me
[SHK] One half of me is yours the other half yours
[SHK] Mine own I would say but if mine then yours
[SHK] And so all yours O these naughty times
[SHK] Put bars between the owners and their rights
[SHK] And so though yours not yours Prove it so
[SHK] Let fortune go to hell for it not I
[SHK] I speak too long but 't is to peize the time
[SHK] To eke it and to draw it out in length
[SHK] To stay you from election
[SHK] Let me choose
[SHK] For as I am I live upon the rack
[SHK] Upon the rack Bassanio then confess
[SHK] What treason there is mingled with your love
[SHK] None but that ugly treason of mistrust
[SHK] Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love
[SHK] There may as well be amity and life
[SHK] 'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love
[SHK] Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack
[SHK] Where men enforced do speak anything
[SHK] Promise me life and I 'll confess the truth
[SHK] Well then confess and live
[SHK] 'Confess and 'love
[SHK] Had been the very sum of my confession
[SHK] O happy torment when my torturer
[SHK] Doth teach me answers for deliverance
[SHK] But let me to my fortune and the caskets
[SHK] Away then I am lock 'd in one of them
[SHK] If you do love me you will find me out
[SHK] Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
[SHK] Let music sound while he doth make his choice
[SHK] Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end
[SHK] Fading in music that the comparison
[SHK] May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
[SHK] And watery death-bed for him He may win
[SHK] And what is music then Then music is
[SHK] Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
[SHK] To a new-crowned monarch such it is
[SHK] As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
[SHK] That creep into the dreaming bridegroom 's ear
[SHK] And summon him to marriage Now he goes
[SHK] With no less presence but with much more love
[SHK] Than young Alcides when he did redeem
[SHK] The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
[SHK] To the sea-monster I stand for sacrifice
[SHK] The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives
[SHK] With bleared visages come forth to view
[SHK] The issue of the exploit Go Hercules
[SHK] Live thou I live with much much more dismay
[SHK] I view the fight than thou that makest the fray
[SHK] Tell me where is fancy bred
[SHK] Or in the heart or in the head
[SHK] How begot how nourished
[SHK] Reply reply
[SHK] It is engender 'd in the eyes
[SHK] With gazing fed and fancy dies
[SHK] In the cradle where it lies
[SHK] Let us all ring fancy 's knell
[SHK] I 'll begin it -- Ding dong bell
[SHK] Ding dong bell
[SHK] So may the outward shows be least themselves
[SHK] The world is still deceived with ornament
[SHK] In law what plea so tainted and corrupt
[SHK] But being seasoned with a gracious voice
[SHK] Obscures the show of evil In religion
[SHK] What damned error but some sober brow
[SHK] Will bless it and approve it with a text
[SHK] Hiding the grossness with fair ornament
[SHK] There is no vice so simple but assumes
[SHK] Some mark of virtue on his outward parts
[SHK] How many cowards whose hearts are all as false
[SHK] As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
[SHK] The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars
[SHK] Who inward search 'd have livers white as milk
[SHK] And these assume but valour 's excrement
[SHK] To render them redoubted Look on beauty
[SHK] And you shall see 't is purchased by the weight
[SHK] Which therein works a miracle in nature
[SHK] Making them lightest that wear most of it
[SHK] So are those crisped snaky golden locks
[SHK] Which make such wanton gambols with the wind
[SHK] Upon supposed fairness often known
[SHK] To be the dowry of a second head
[SHK] The skull that bred them in the sepulchre
[SHK] Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
[SHK] To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
[SHK] Veiling an Indian beauty in a word
[SHK] The seeming truth which cunning times put on
[SHK] To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold
[SHK] Hard food for Midas I will none of thee
[SHK] Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
[SHK] 'Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
[SHK] Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught
[SHK] Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence
[SHK] And here choose I joy be the consequence
[SHK] As doubtful thoughts and rash-embraced despair
[SHK] And shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousy O love
[SHK] Be moderate allay thy ecstasy
[SHK] In measure rein thy joy scant this excess
[SHK] I feel too much thy blessing make it less
[SHK] For fear I surfeit
[SHK] What find I here
[SHK] Fair Portia 's counterfeit What demi-god
[SHK] Hath come so near creation Move these eyes
[SHK] Or whether riding on the balls of mine
[SHK] Seem they in motion Here are sever 'd lips
[SHK] Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
[SHK] Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs
[SHK] The painter plays the spider and hath woven
[SHK] A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
[SHK] Faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes --
[SHK] How could he see to do them having made one
[SHK] Methinks it should have power to steal both his
[SHK] And leave itself unfurnish 'd Yet look how far
[SHK] The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
[SHK] In underprizing it so far this shadow
[SHK] Doth limp behind the substance Here 's the scroll
[SHK] The continent and summary of my fortune
[SHK] You that choose not by the view
[SHK] Chance as fair and choose as true
[SHK] Since this fortune falls to you
[SHK] Be content and seek no new
[SHK] If you be well pleased with this
[SHK] And hold your fortune for your bliss
[SHK] Turn you where your lady is
[SHK] And claim her with a loving kiss
[SHK] A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave
[SHK] I come by note to give and to receive
[SHK] Like one of two contending in a prize
[SHK] That thinks he hath done well in people 's eyes
[SHK] Hearing applause and universal shout
[SHK] Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
[SHK] Whether these pearls of praise be his or no
[SHK] So thrice fair lady stand I even so
[SHK] As doubtful whether what I see be true
[SHK] Until confirm 'd sign 'd ratified by you
[SHK] You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand
[SHK] Such as I am though for myself alone
[SHK] I would not be ambitious in my wish
[SHK] To wish myself much better yet for you
[SHK] I would be trebled twenty times myself
[SHK] A thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
[SHK] That only to stand high in your account
[SHK] I might in virtue beauties livings friends
[SHK] Exceed account but the full sum of me
[SHK] Is sum of something which to term in gross
[SHK] Is an unlesson 'd girl unschool 'd unpractised
[SHK] Happy in this she is not yet so old
[SHK] But she may learn happier than this
[SHK] She is not bred so dull but she can learn
[SHK] Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
[SHK] Commits itself to yours to be directed
[SHK] As from her lord her governor her king
[SHK] Myself and what is mine to you and yours
[SHK] Is now converted but now I was the lord
[SHK] Of this fair mansion master of my servants
[SHK] Queen o'er myself and even now but now
[SHK] This house these servants and this same myself
[SHK] Are yours my lord I give them with this ring
[SHK] Which when you part from lose or give away
[SHK] Let it presage the ruin of your love
[SHK] And be my vantage to exclaim on you
[SHK] Madam you have bereft me of all words
[SHK] Only my blood speaks to you in my veins
[SHK] And there is such confusion in my powers
[SHK] As after some oration fairly spoke
[SHK] By a beloved prince there doth appear
[SHK] Among the buzzing pleased multitude
[SHK] Where every something being blent together
[SHK] Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
[SHK] Express 'd and not express 'd But when this ring
[SHK] Parts from this finger then parts life from hence
[SHK] O then be bold to say Bassanio 's dead
[SHK] My lord and lady it is now our time
[SHK] That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
[SHK] To cry good joy good joy my lord and lady
[SHK] My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady
[SHK] I wish you all the joy that you can wish
[SHK] For I am sure you can wish none from me
[SHK] And when your honours mean to solemnize
[SHK] The bargain of your faith I do beseech you
[SHK] Even at that time I may be married too
[SHK] With all my heart so thou canst get a wife
[SHK] I thank your lordship you have got me one
[SHK] My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
[SHK] You saw the mistress I beheld the maid
[SHK] You loved I loved for intermission
[SHK] No more pertains to me my lord than you
[SHK] Your fortune stood upon the casket there
[SHK] And so did mine too as the matter falls
[SHK] For wooing here until I sweat again
[SHK] And sweating until my very roof was dry
[SHK] With oaths of love at last if promise last
[SHK] I got a promise of this fair one here
[SHK] To have her love provided that your fortune
[SHK] Achieved her mistress
[SHK] Is this true Nerissa
[SHK] Madam it is so you stand pleased withal
[SHK] And do you Gratiano mean good faith
[SHK] Yes faith my lord
[SHK] Our feast shall be much honour 'd in your marriage
[SHK] We 'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
[SHK] What and stake down
[SHK] No we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down
[SHK] But who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel What
[SHK] and my old Venetian friend Salerio
[SHK] Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hither
[SHK] If that the youth of my new interest here
[SHK] Have power to bid you welcome By your leave
[SHK] I bid my very friends and countrymen
[SHK] Sweet Portia welcome
[SHK] So do I my lord
[SHK] They are entirely welcome
[SHK] I thank your honour For my part my lord
[SHK] My purpose was not to have seen you here
[SHK] But meeting with Salerio by the way
[SHK] He did entreat me past all saying nay
[SHK] To come with him along
[SHK] I did my lord
[SHK] And I have reason for it Signior Antonio
[SHK] Commends him to you
[SHK] Ere I ope his letter
[SHK] I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
[SHK] Not sick my lord unless it be in mind
[SHK] Nor well unless in mind his letter there
[SHK] Will show you his estate
[SHK] Nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
[SHK] Your hand Salerio what 's the news from Venice
[SHK] How doth that royal merchant good Antonio
[SHK] I know he will be glad of our success
[SHK] We are the Jasons we have won the fleece
[SHK] I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
[SHK] There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
[SHK] That steals the colour from Bassanio 's cheek
[SHK] Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
[SHK] Could turn so much the constitution
[SHK] Of any constant man What worse and worse
[SHK] With leave Bassanio I am half yourself
[SHK] And I must freely have the half of anything
[SHK] That this same paper brings you
[SHK] O sweet Portia
[SHK] Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
[SHK] That ever blotted paper Gentle lady
[SHK] When I did first impart my love to you
[SHK] I freely told you all the wealth I had
[SHK] Ran in my veins I was a gentleman
[SHK] And then I told you true and yet dear lady
[SHK] Rating myself at nothing you shall see
[SHK] How much I was a braggart When I told you
[SHK] My state was nothing I should then have told you
[SHK] That I was worse than nothing for indeed
[SHK] I have engaged myself to a dear friend
[SHK] Engaged my friend to his mere enemy
[SHK] To feed my means Here is a letter lady
[SHK] The paper as the body of my friend
[SHK] And every word in it a gaping wound
[SHK] Issuing life-blood But is it true Salerio
[SHK] Have all his ventures fail 'd What not one hit
[SHK] From Tripolis from Mexico and England
[SHK] From Lisbon Barbary and India
[SHK] And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
[SHK] Of merchant-marring rocks
[SHK] Not one my lord
[SHK] Besides it should appear that if he had
[SHK] The present money to discharge the Jew
[SHK] He would not take it Never did I know
[SHK] A creature that did bear the shape of man
[SHK] So keen and greedy to confound a man
[SHK] He plies the duke at morning and at night
[SHK] And doth impeach the freedom of the state
[SHK] If they deny him justice twenty merchants
[SHK] The duke himself and the magnificoes
[SHK] Of greatest port have all persuaded with him
[SHK] But none can drive him from the envious plea
[SHK] Of forfeiture of justice and his bond
[SHK] When I was with him I have heard him swear
[SHK] To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen
[SHK] That he would rather have Antonio 's flesh
[SHK] Than twenty times the value of the sum
[SHK] That he did owe him and I know my lord
[SHK] If law authority and power deny not
[SHK] It will go hard with poor Antonio
[SHK] Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
[SHK] The dearest friend to me the kindest man
[SHK] The best-condition 'd and unwearied spirit
[SHK] In doing courtesies and one in whom
[SHK] The ancient Roman honour more appears
[SHK] Than any that draws breath in Italy
[SHK] What sum owes he the Jew
[SHK] For me three thousand ducats
[SHK] What no more
[SHK] Pay him six thousand and deface the bond
[SHK] Double six thousand and then treble that
[SHK] Before a friend of this description
[SHK] Shall lose a hair through Bassanio 's fault
[SHK] First go with me to church and call me wife
[SHK] And then away to Venice to your friend
[SHK] For never shall you lie by Portia 's side
[SHK] With an unquiet soul You shall have gold
[SHK] To pay the petty debt twenty times over
[SHK] When it is paid bring your true friend along
[SHK] My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
[SHK] Will live as maids and widows Come away
[SHK] For you shall hence upon your wedding-day
[SHK] Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
[SHK] Since you are dear bought I will love you dear
[SHK] But let me hear the letter of your friend
[SHK] miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is
[SHK] very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since
[SHK] in paying it it is impossible I should live all
[SHK] debts are cleared between you and I if I might but
[SHK] see you at my death Notwithstanding use your
[SHK] pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come
[SHK] let not my letter
[SHK] O love dispatch all business and be gone
[SHK] Since I have your good leave to go away
[SHK] I will make haste but till I come again
[SHK] No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay
[SHK] No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain
[SHK] Gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy
[SHK] This is the fool that lent out money gratis
[SHK] Gaoler look to him
[SHK] Hear me yet good Shylock
[SHK] I 'll have my bond speak not against my bond
[SHK] I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond
[SHK] Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause
[SHK] But since I am a dog beware my fangs
[SHK] The duke shall grant me justice I do wonder
[SHK] Thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
[SHK] To come abroad with him at his request
[SHK] I pray thee hear me speak
[SHK] I 'll have my bond I will not hear thee speak
[SHK] I 'll have my bond and therefore speak no more
[SHK] I 'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool
[SHK] To shake the head relent and sigh and yield
[SHK] To Christian intercessors Follow not
[SHK] I 'll have no speaking I will have my bond
[SHK] It is the most impenetrable cur
[SHK] That ever kept with men
[SHK] Let him alone
[SHK] I 'll follow him no more with bootless prayers
[SHK] He seeks my life his reason well I know
[SHK] I oft deliver 'd from his forfeitures
[SHK] Many that have at times made moan to me
[SHK] Therefore he hates me
[SHK] I am sure the duke
[SHK] Will never grant this forfeiture to hold
[SHK] The duke can not deny the course of law
[SHK] For the commodity that strangers have
[SHK] With us in Venice if it be denied
[SHK] Will much impeach the justice of his state
[SHK] Since that the trade and profit of the city
[SHK] Consisteth of all nations Therefore go
[SHK] These griefs and losses have so bated me
[SHK] That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
[SHK] To-morrow to my bloody creditor
[SHK] Well gaoler on Pray God Bassanio come
[SHK] To see me pay his debt and then I care not
[SHK] Madam although I speak it in your presence
[SHK] You have a noble and a true conceit
[SHK] Of godlike amity which appears most strongly
[SHK] In bearing thus the absence of your lord
[SHK] But if you knew to whom you show this honour
[SHK] How true a gentleman you send relief
[SHK] How dear a lover of my lord your husband
[SHK] I know you would be prouder of the work
[SHK] Than customary bounty can enforce you
[SHK] I never did repent for doing good
[SHK] Nor shall not now for in companions
[SHK] That do converse and waste the time together
[SHK] Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love
[SHK] There must be needs a like proportion
[SHK] Of lineaments of manners and of spirit
[SHK] Which makes me think that this Antonio
[SHK] Being the bosom lover of my lord
[SHK] Must needs be like my lord If it be so
[SHK] How little is the cost I have bestow 'd
[SHK] In purchasing the semblance of my soul
[SHK] From out the state of hellish misery
[SHK] This comes too near the praising of myself
[SHK] Therefore no more of it hear other things
[SHK] Lorenzo I commit into your hands
[SHK] The husbandry and manage of my house
[SHK] Until my lord 's return for mine own part
[SHK] I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
[SHK] To live in prayer and contemplation
[SHK] Only attended by Nerissa here
[SHK] Until her husband and my lord 's return
[SHK] There is a monastery two miles off
[SHK] And there will we abide I do desire you
[SHK] Not to deny this imposition
[SHK] The which my love and some necessity
[SHK] Now lays upon you
[SHK] Madam with all my heart
[SHK] I shall obey you in all fair commands
[SHK] My people do already know my mind
[SHK] And will acknowledge you and Jessica
[SHK] In place of Lord Bassanio and myself
[SHK] And so farewell till we shall meet again
[SHK] Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
[SHK] I wish your ladyship all heart 's content
[SHK] I thank you for your wish and am well pleased
[SHK] To wish it back on you fare you well Jessica
[SHK] Now Balthasar
[SHK] As I have ever found thee honest-true
[SHK] So let me find thee still Take this same letter
[SHK] And use thou all the endeavour of a man
[SHK] In speed to Padua see thou render this
[SHK] Into my cousin 's hand Doctor Bellario
[SHK] And look what notes and garments he doth give thee
[SHK] Bring them I pray thee with imagined speed
[SHK] Unto the tranect to the common ferry
[SHK] Which trades to Venice Waste no time in words
[SHK] But get thee gone I shall be there before thee
[SHK] Madam I go with all convenient speed
[SHK] Come on Nerissa I have work in hand
[SHK] That you yet know not of we 'll see our husbands
[SHK] Before they think of us
[SHK] Shall they see us
[SHK] They shall Nerissa but in such a habit
[SHK] That they shall think we are accomplished
[SHK] With that we lack I 'll hold thee any wager
[SHK] When we are both accoutred like young men
[SHK] I 'll prove the prettier fellow of the two
[SHK] And wear my dagger with the braver grace
[SHK] And speak between the change of man and boy
[SHK] With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
[SHK] Into a manly stride and speak of frays
[SHK] Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
[SHK] How honourable ladies sought my love
[SHK] Which I denying they fell sick and died
[SHK] I could not do withal then I 'll repent
[SHK] And wish for all that that I had not killed them
[SHK] And twenty of these puny lies I 'll tell
[SHK] That men shall swear I have discontinued school
[SHK] Above a twelvemonth I have within my mind
[SHK] A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks
[SHK] Which I will practise
[SHK] Why shall we turn to men
[SHK] Fie what a question 's that
[SHK] If thou wert near a lewd interpreter
[SHK] But come I 'll tell thee all my whole device
[SHK] When I am in my coach which stays for us
[SHK] At the park gate and therefore haste away
[SHK] For we must measure twenty miles to-day
[SHK] Yes truly for look you the sins of the father
[SHK] are to be laid upon the children therefore I
[SHK] promise ye I fear you I was always plain with
[SHK] you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter
[SHK] therefore be of good cheer for truly I think you
[SHK] are damned There is but one hope in it that can do
[SHK] you any good and that is but a kind of bastard
[SHK] hope neither
[SHK] And what hope is that I pray thee
[SHK] Marry you may partly hope that your father got you
[SHK] not that you are not the Jew 's daughter
[SHK] That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the
[SHK] sins of my mother should be visited upon me
[SHK] Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
[SHK] mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I
[SHK] fall into Charybdis your mother well you are
[SHK] gone both ways
[SHK] I shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a
[SHK] Christian
[SHK] Truly the more to blame he we were Christians
[SHK] enow before e'en as many as could well live one by
[SHK] another This making Christians will raise the
[SHK] price of hogs if we grow all to be pork-eaters we
[SHK] shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
[SHK] I 'll tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comes
[SHK] I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if
[SHK] you thus get my wife into corners
[SHK] Nay you need not fear us Lorenzo Launcelot and I
[SHK] are out He tells me flatly there is no mercy for
[SHK] me in heaven because I am a Jew 's daughter and he
[SHK] says you are no good member of the commonwealth
[SHK] for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the
[SHK] price of pork
[SHK] I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
[SHK] you can the getting up of the negro 's belly the
[SHK] Moor is with child by you Launcelot
[SHK] It is much that the Moor should be more than reason
[SHK] but if she be less than an honest woman she is
[SHK] indeed more than I took her for
[SHK] How every fool can play upon the word I think the
[SHK] best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence
[SHK] and discourse grow commendable in none only but
[SHK] parrots Go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner
[SHK] That is done sir they have all stomachs
[SHK] Goodly Lord what a wit-snapper are you then bid
[SHK] them prepare dinner
[SHK] That is done too sir only 'cover is the word
[SHK] Will you cover then sir
[SHK] Not so sir neither I know my duty
[SHK] Yet more quarrelling with occasion Wilt thou show
[SHK] the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray
[SHK] tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning
[SHK] go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve
[SHK] in the meat and we will come in to dinner
[SHK] For the table sir it shall be served in for the
[SHK] meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in
[SHK] to dinner sir why let it be as humours and
[SHK] conceits shall govern
[SHK] O dear discretion how his words are suited
[SHK] The fool hath planted in his memory
[SHK] An army of good words and I do know
[SHK] A many fools that stand in better place
[SHK] Garnish 'd like him that for a tricksy word
[SHK] Defy the matter How cheerest thou Jessica
[SHK] And now good sweet say thy opinion
[SHK] How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio 's wife
[SHK] Past all expressing It is very meet
[SHK] The Lord Bassanio live an upright life
[SHK] For having such a blessing in his lady
[SHK] He finds the joys of heaven here on earth
[SHK] And if on earth he do not mean it then
[SHK] In reason he should never come to heaven
[SHK] Why if two gods should play some heavenly match
[SHK] And on the wager lay two earthly women
[SHK] And Portia one there must be something else
[SHK] Pawn 'd with the other for the poor rude world
[SHK] Hath not her fellow
[SHK] Even such a husband
[SHK] Hast thou of me as she is for a wife
[SHK] Nay but ask my opinion too of that
[SHK] I will anon first let us go to dinner
[SHK] Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach
[SHK] No pray thee let it serve for table-talk
[SHK] Then howso'er thou speak'st 'mong other things
[SHK] I shall digest it
[SHK] Well I 'll set you forth
[SHK] What is Antonio here
[SHK] Ready so please your grace
[SHK] I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
[SHK] A stony adversary an inhuman wretch
[SHK] uncapable of pity void and empty
[SHK] From any dram of mercy
[SHK] I have heard
[SHK] Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
[SHK] His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
[SHK] And that no lawful means can carry me
[SHK] Out of his envy 's reach I do oppose
[SHK] My patience to his fury and am arm 'd
[SHK] To suffer with a quietness of spirit
[SHK] The very tyranny and rage of his
[SHK] Go one and call the Jew into the court
[SHK] He is ready at the door he comes my lord
[SHK] Make room and let him stand before our face
[SHK] Shylock the world thinks and I think so too
[SHK] That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
[SHK] To the last hour of act and then 't is thought
[SHK] Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
[SHK] Than is thy strange apparent cruelty
[SHK] And where thou now exact'st the penalty
[SHK] Which is a pound of this poor merchant 's flesh
[SHK] Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
[SHK] But touch 'd with human gentleness and love
[SHK] Forgive a moiety of the principal
[SHK] Glancing an eye of pity on his losses
[SHK] That have of late so huddled on his back
[SHK] Enow to press a royal merchant down
[SHK] And pluck commiseration of his state
[SHK] From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
[SHK] From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train 'd
[SHK] To offices of tender courtesy
[SHK] We all expect a gentle answer Jew
[SHK] I have possess 'd your grace of what I purpose
[SHK] And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
[SHK] To have the due and forfeit of my bond
[SHK] If you deny it let the danger light
[SHK] Upon your charter and your city 's freedom
[SHK] You 'll ask me why I rather choose to have
[SHK] A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
[SHK] Three thousand ducats I 'll not answer that
[SHK] But say it is my humour is it answer 'd
[SHK] What if my house be troubled with a rat
[SHK] And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
[SHK] To have it baned What are you answer 'd yet
[SHK] Some men there are love not a gaping pig
[SHK] Some that are mad if they behold a cat
[SHK] And others when the bagpipe sings i the nose
[SHK] Can not contain their urine for affection
[SHK] Mistress of passion sways it to the mood
[SHK] Of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer
[SHK] As there is no firm reason to be render 'd
[SHK] Why he can not abide a gaping pig
[SHK] Why he a harmless necessary cat
[SHK] Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
[SHK] Must yield to such inevitable shame
[SHK] As to offend himself being offended
[SHK] So can I give no reason nor I will not
[SHK] More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
[SHK] I bear Antonio that I follow thus
[SHK] A losing suit against him Are you answer 'd
[SHK] This is no answer thou unfeeling man
[SHK] To excuse the current of thy cruelty
[SHK] I am not bound to please thee with my answers
[SHK] Do all men kill the things they do not love
[SHK] Hates any man the thing he would not kill
[SHK] Every offence is not a hate at first
[SHK] What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
[SHK] I pray you think you question with the Jew
[SHK] You may as well go stand upon the beach
[SHK] And bid the main flood bate his usual height
[SHK] You may as well use question with the wolf
[SHK] Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
[SHK] You may as well forbid the mountain pines
[SHK] To wag their high tops and to make no noise
[SHK] When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
[SHK] You may as well do anything most hard
[SHK] As seek to soften that -- than which what 's harder --
[SHK] His Jewish heart therefore I do beseech you
[SHK] Make no more offers use no farther means
[SHK] But with all brief and plain conveniency
[SHK] Let me have judgment and the Jew his will
[SHK] For thy three thousand ducats here is six
[SHK] What judgment shall I dread doing
[SHK] Were in six parts and every part a ducat
[SHK] I would not draw them I would have my bond
[SHK] How shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
[SHK] What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong
[SHK] You have among you many a purchased slave
[SHK] Which like your asses and your dogs and mules
[SHK] You use in abject and in slavish parts
[SHK] Because you bought them shall I say to you
[SHK] Let them be free marry them to your heirs
[SHK] Why sweat they under burthens let their beds
[SHK] Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
[SHK] Be season 'd with such viands You will answer
[SHK] 'The slaves are ours so do I answer you
[SHK] The pound of flesh which I demand of him
[SHK] Is dearly bought 't is mine and I will have it
[SHK] If you deny me fie upon your law
[SHK] There is no force in the decrees of Venice
[SHK] I stand for judgment answer shall I have it
[SHK] Upon my power I may dismiss this court
[SHK] Unless Bellario a learned doctor
[SHK] Whom I have sent for to determine this
[SHK] Come here to-day
[SHK] My lord here stays without
[SHK] A messenger with letters from the doctor
[SHK] New come from Padua
[SHK] Bring us the letter call the messenger
[SHK] Good cheer Antonio What man courage yet
[SHK] The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
[SHK] Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
[SHK] I am a tainted wether of the flock
[SHK] Meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
[SHK] Drops earliest to the ground and so let me
[SHK] You can not better be employ 'd Bassanio
[SHK] Than to live still and write mine epitaph
[SHK] Came you from Padua from Bellario
[SHK] From both my lord Bellario greets your grace
[SHK] Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
[SHK] To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
[SHK] Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew
[SHK] Thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can
[SHK] No not the hangman 's axe bear half the keenness
[SHK] Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee
[SHK] No none that thou hast wit enough to make
[SHK] O be thou damn 'd inexecrable dog
[SHK] And for thy life let justice be accused
[SHK] Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
[SHK] To hold opinion with Pythagoras
[SHK] That souls of animals infuse themselves
[SHK] Into the trunks of men thy currish spirit
[SHK] Govern 'd a wolf who hang 'd for human slaughter
[SHK] Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
[SHK] And whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow 'd dam
[SHK] Infused itself in thee for thy desires
[SHK] Are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous
[SHK] Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
[SHK] Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
[SHK] Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
[SHK] To cureless ruin I stand here for law
[SHK] This letter from Bellario doth commend
[SHK] A young and learned doctor to our court
[SHK] Where is he
[SHK] He attendeth here hard by
[SHK] To know your answer whether you 'll admit him
[SHK] With all my heart Some three or four of you
[SHK] Go give him courteous conduct to this place
[SHK] Meantime the court shall hear Bellario 's letter
[SHK] Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
[SHK] your letter I am very sick but in the instant that
[SHK] your messenger came in loving visitation was with
[SHK] me a young doctor of Rome his name is Balthasar I
[SHK] acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
[SHK] the Jew and Antonio the merchant we turned o'er
[SHK] many books together he is furnished with my
[SHK] opinion which bettered with his own learning the
[SHK] greatness whereof I can not enough commend comes
[SHK] with him at my importunity to fill up your grace 's
[SHK] request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of
[SHK] years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
[SHK] estimation for I never knew so young a body with so
[SHK] old a head I leave him to your gracious
[SHK] acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
[SHK] commendation
[SHK] You hear the learn 'd Bellario what he writes
[SHK] And here I take it is the doctor come
[SHK] Give me your hand Come you from old Bellario
[SHK] I did my lord
[SHK] You are welcome take your place
[SHK] Are you acquainted with the difference
[SHK] That holds this present question in the court
[SHK] I am informed thoroughly of the cause
[SHK] Which is the merchant here and which the Jew
[SHK] Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth
[SHK] Is your name Shylock
[SHK] Shylock is my name
[SHK] Of a strange nature is the suit you follow
[SHK] Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
[SHK] Can not impugn you as you do proceed
[SHK] You stand within his danger do you not
[SHK] Ay so he says
[SHK] Do you confess the bond
[SHK] I do
[SHK] Then must the Jew be merciful
[SHK] On what compulsion must I tell me that
[SHK] The quality of mercy is not strain 'd
[SHK] It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
[SHK] Upon the place beneath it is twice blest
[SHK] It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
[SHK] 'T is mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
[SHK] The throned monarch better than his crown
[SHK] His sceptre shows the force of temporal power
[SHK] The attribute to awe and majesty
[SHK] Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
[SHK] But mercy is above this sceptred sway
[SHK] It is enthroned in the hearts of kings
[SHK] It is an attribute to God himself
[SHK] And earthly power doth then show likest God 's
[SHK] When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew
[SHK] Though justice be thy plea consider this
[SHK] That in the course of justice none of us
[SHK] Should see salvation we do pray for mercy
[SHK] And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
[SHK] The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much
[SHK] To mitigate the justice of thy plea
[SHK] Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice
[SHK] Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there
[SHK] My deeds upon my head I crave the law
[SHK] The penalty and forfeit of my bond
[SHK] Is he not able to discharge the money
[SHK] Yes here I tender it for him in the court
[SHK] Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
[SHK] I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er
[SHK] On forfeit of my hands my head my heart
[SHK] If this will not suffice it must appear
[SHK] That malice bears down truth And I beseech you
[SHK] Wrest once the law to your authority
[SHK] To do a great right do a little wrong
[SHK] And curb this cruel devil of his will
[SHK] It must not be there is no power in Venice
[SHK] Can alter a decree established
[SHK] 'Twill be recorded for a precedent
[SHK] And many an error by the same example
[SHK] Will rush into the state it can not be
[SHK] A Daniel come to judgment yea a Daniel
[SHK] O wise young judge how I do honour thee
[SHK] I pray you let me look upon the bond
[SHK] Here 't is most reverend doctor here it is
[SHK] Shylock there 's thrice thy money offer 'd thee
[SHK] An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven
[SHK] Shall I lay perjury upon my soul
[SHK] No not for Venice
[SHK] Why this bond is forfeit
[SHK] And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
[SHK] A pound of flesh to be by him cut off
[SHK] Nearest the merchant 's heart Be merciful
[SHK] Take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
[SHK] When it is paid according to the tenor
[SHK] It doth appear you are a worthy judge
[SHK] You know the law your exposition
[SHK] Hath been most sound I charge you by the law
[SHK] Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar
[SHK] Proceed to judgment by my soul I swear
[SHK] There is no power in the tongue of man
[SHK] To alter me I stay here on my bond
[SHK] Most heartily I do beseech the court
[SHK] To give the judgment
[SHK] Why then thus it is
[SHK] You must prepare your bosom for his knife
[SHK] O noble judge O excellent young man
[SHK] For the intent and purpose of the law
[SHK] Hath full relation to the penalty
[SHK] Which here appeareth due upon the bond
[SHK] 'T is very true O wise and upright judge
[SHK] How much more elder art thou than thy looks
[SHK] Therefore lay bare your bosom
[SHK] Ay his breast
[SHK] So says the bond doth it not noble judge
[SHK] 'Nearest his heart those are the very words
[SHK] It is so Are there balance here to weigh
[SHK] The flesh
[SHK] I have them ready
[SHK] Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge
[SHK] To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
[SHK] Is it so nominated in the bond
[SHK] It is not so express 'd but what of that
[SHK] 'Twere good you do so much for charity
[SHK] I can not find it 't is not in the bond
[SHK] You merchant have you any thing to say
[SHK] But little I am arm 'd and well prepared
[SHK] Give me your hand Bassanio fare you well
[SHK] Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you
[SHK] For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
[SHK] Than is her custom it is still her use
[SHK] To let the wretched man outlive his wealth
[SHK] To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
[SHK] An age of poverty from which lingering penance
[SHK] Of such misery doth she cut me off
[SHK] Commend me to your honourable wife
[SHK] Tell her the process of Antonio 's end
[SHK] Say how I loved you speak me fair in death
[SHK] And when the tale is told bid her be judge
[SHK] Whether Bassanio had not once a love
[SHK] Repent but you that you shall lose your friend
[SHK] And he repents not that he pays your debt
[SHK] For if the Jew do cut but deep enough
[SHK] I 'll pay it presently with all my heart
[SHK] Antonio I am married to a wife
[SHK] Which is as dear to me as life itself
[SHK] But life itself my wife and all the world
[SHK] Are not with me esteem 'd above thy life
[SHK] I would lose all ay sacrifice them all
[SHK] Here to this devil to deliver you
[SHK] Your wife would give you little thanks for that
[SHK] If she were by to hear you make the offer
[SHK] I have a wife whom I protest I love
[SHK] I would she were in heaven so she could
[SHK] Entreat some power to change this currish Jew
[SHK] 'T is well you offer it behind her back
[SHK] The wish would make else an unquiet house
[SHK] These be the Christian husbands I have a daughter
[SHK] Would any of the stock of Barrabas
[SHK] Had been her husband rather than a Christian
[SHK] We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence
[SHK] A pound of that same merchant 's flesh is thine
[SHK] The court awards it and the law doth give it
[SHK] Most rightful judge
[SHK] And you must cut this flesh from off his breast
[SHK] The law allows it and the court awards it
[SHK] Most learned judge A sentence Come prepare
[SHK] Tarry a little there is something else
[SHK] This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
[SHK] The words expressly are a pound of flesh
[SHK] Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
[SHK] But in the cutting it if thou dost shed
[SHK] One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods
[SHK] Are by the laws of Venice confiscate
[SHK] Unto the state of Venice
[SHK] O upright judge Mark Jew O learned judge
[SHK] Is that the law
[SHK] Thyself shalt see the act
[SHK] For as thou urgest justice be assured
[SHK] Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
[SHK] O learned judge Mark Jew a learned judge
[SHK] I take this offer then pay the bond thrice
[SHK] And let the Christian go
[SHK] Here is the money
[SHK] Soft
[SHK] The Jew shall have all justice soft no haste
[SHK] He shall have nothing but the penalty
[SHK] O Jew an upright judge a learned judge
[SHK] Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
[SHK] Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
[SHK] But just a pound of flesh if thou cut'st more
[SHK] Or less than a just pound be it but so much
[SHK] As makes it light or heavy in the substance
[SHK] Or the division of the twentieth part
[SHK] Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
[SHK] But in the estimation of a hair
[SHK] Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
[SHK] A second Daniel a Daniel Jew
[SHK] Now infidel I have you on the hip
[SHK] Why doth the Jew pause take thy forfeiture
[SHK] Give me my principal and let me go
[SHK] I have it ready for thee here it is
[SHK] He hath refused it in the open court
[SHK] He shall have merely justice and his bond
[SHK] A Daniel still say I a second Daniel
[SHK] I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word
[SHK] Shall I not have barely my principal
[SHK] Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
[SHK] To be so taken at thy peril Jew
[SHK] Why then the devil give him good of it
[SHK] I 'll stay no longer question
[SHK] Tarry Jew
[SHK] The law hath yet another hold on you
[SHK] It is enacted in the laws of Venice
[SHK] If it be proved against an alien
[SHK] That by direct or indirect attempts
[SHK] He seek the life of any citizen
[SHK] The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
[SHK] Shall seize one half his goods the other half
[SHK] Comes to the privy coffer of the state
[SHK] And the offender 's life lies in the mercy
[SHK] Of the duke only 'gainst all other voice
[SHK] In which predicament I say thou stand'st
[SHK] For it appears by manifest proceeding
[SHK] That indirectly and directly too
[SHK] Thou hast contrived against the very life
[SHK] Of the defendant and thou hast incurr 'd
[SHK] The danger formerly by me rehearsed
[SHK] Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
[SHK] Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
[SHK] And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
[SHK] Thou hast not left the value of a cord
[SHK] Therefore thou must be hang 'd at the state 's charge
[SHK] That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits
[SHK] I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
[SHK] For half thy wealth it is Antonio 's
[SHK] The other half comes to the general state
[SHK] Which humbleness may drive unto a fine
[SHK] Ay for the state not for Antonio
[SHK] Nay take my life and all pardon not that
[SHK] You take my house when you do take the prop
[SHK] That doth sustain my house you take my life
[SHK] When you do take the means whereby I live
[SHK] What mercy can you render him Antonio
[SHK] A halter gratis nothing else for God 's sake
[SHK] So please my lord the duke and all the court
[SHK] To quit the fine for one half of his goods
[SHK] I am content so he will let me have
[SHK] The other half in use to render it
[SHK] Upon his death unto the gentleman
[SHK] That lately stole his daughter
[SHK] Two things provided more that for this favour
[SHK] He presently become a Christian
[SHK] The other that he do record a gift
[SHK] Here in the court of all he dies possess 'd
[SHK] Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter
[SHK] He shall do this or else I do recant
[SHK] The pardon that I late pronounced here
[SHK] Art thou contented Jew what dost thou say
[SHK] I am content
[SHK] Clerk draw a deed of gift
[SHK] I pray you give me leave to go from hence
[SHK] I am not well send the deed after me
[SHK] And I will sign it
[SHK] Get thee gone but do it
[SHK] In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers
[SHK] Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
[SHK] To bring thee to the gallows not the font
[SHK] Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner
[SHK] I humbly do desire your grace of pardon
[SHK] I must away this night toward Padua
[SHK] And it is meet I presently set forth
[SHK] I am sorry that your leisure serves you not
[SHK] Antonio gratify this gentleman
[SHK] For in my mind you are much bound to him
[SHK] Most worthy gentleman I and my friend
[SHK] Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
[SHK] Of grievous penalties in lieu whereof
[SHK] Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew
[SHK] We freely cope your courteous pains withal
[SHK] And stand indebted over and above
[SHK] In love and service to you evermore
[SHK] He is well paid that is well satisfied
[SHK] And I delivering you am satisfied
[SHK] And therein do account myself well paid
[SHK] My mind was never yet more mercenary
[SHK] I pray you know me when we meet again
[SHK] I wish you well and so I take my leave
[SHK] Dear sir of force I must attempt you further
[SHK] Take some remembrance of us as a tribute
[SHK] Not as a fee grant me two things I pray you
[SHK] Not to deny me and to pardon me
[SHK] You press me far and therefore I will yield
[SHK] Give me your gloves I 'll wear them for your sake
[SHK] And for your love I 'll take this ring from you
[SHK] Do not draw back your hand I 'll take no more
[SHK] And you in love shall not deny me this
[SHK] This ring good sir alas it is a trifle
[SHK] I will not shame myself to give you this
[SHK] I will have nothing else but only this
[SHK] And now methinks I have a mind to it
[SHK] There 's more depends on this than on the value
[SHK] The dearest ring in Venice will I give you
[SHK] And find it out by proclamation
[SHK] Only for this I pray you pardon me
[SHK] I see sir you are liberal in offers
[SHK] You taught me first to beg and now methinks
[SHK] You teach me how a beggar should be answer 'd
[SHK] Good sir this ring was given me by my wife
[SHK] And when she put it on she made me vow
[SHK] That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it
[SHK] That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts
[SHK] An if your wife be not a mad-woman
[SHK] And know how well I have deserved the ring
[SHK] She would not hold out enemy for ever
[SHK] For giving it to me Well peace be with you
[SHK] My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring
[SHK] Let his deservings and my love withal
[SHK] Be valued against your wife 's commandment
[SHK] Go Gratiano run and overtake him
[SHK] Give him the ring and bring him if thou canst
[SHK] Unto Antonio 's house away make haste
[SHK] Come you and I will thither presently
[SHK] And in the morning early will we both
[SHK] Fly toward Belmont come Antonio
[SHK] Inquire the Jew 's house out give him this deed
[SHK] And let him sign it we 'll away to-night
[SHK] And be a day before our husbands home
[SHK] This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo
[SHK] Fair sir you are well o'erta'en
[SHK] My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
[SHK] Hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat
[SHK] Your company at dinner
[SHK] That can not be
[SHK] His ring I do accept most thankfully
[SHK] And so I pray you tell him furthermore
[SHK] I pray you show my youth old Shylock 's house
[SHK] That will I do
[SHK] Sir I would speak with you
[SHK] I 'll see if I can get my husband 's ring
[SHK] Which I did make him swear to keep for ever
[SHK] We shall have old swearing
[SHK] That they did give the rings away to men
[SHK] But we 'll outface them and outswear them too
[SHK] Away make haste thou knowist where I will tarry
[SHK] Come good sir will you show me to this house
[SHK] The moon shines bright in such a night as this
[SHK] When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
[SHK] And they did make no noise in such a night
[SHK] Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
[SHK] And sigh 'd his soul toward the Grecian tents
[SHK] Where Cressid lay that night
[SHK] In such a night
[SHK] Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
[SHK] And saw the lion 's shadow ere himself
[SHK] And ran dismay 'd away
[SHK] In such a night
[SHK] Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
[SHK] Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
[SHK] To come again to Carthage
[SHK] In such a night
[SHK] Medea gather 'd the enchanted herbs
[SHK] That did renew old AEson
[SHK] In such a night
[SHK] Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
[SHK] And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
[SHK] As far as Belmont
[SHK] In such a night
[SHK] Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well
[SHK] Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
[SHK] And ne'er a true one
[SHK] In such a night
[SHK] Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew
[SHK] Slander her love and he forgave it her
[SHK] I would out-night you did no body come
[SHK] But hark I hear the footing of a man
[SHK] Who comes so fast in silence of the night
[SHK] A friend
[SHK] A friend what friend your name I pray you friend
[SHK] Stephano is my name and I bring word
[SHK] My mistress will before the break of day
[SHK] Be here at Belmont she doth stray about
[SHK] By holy crosses where she kneels and prays
[SHK] For happy wedlock hours
[SHK] Who comes with her
[SHK] None but a holy hermit and her maid
[SHK] I pray you is my master yet return 'd
[SHK] He is not nor we have not heard from him
[SHK] But go we in I pray thee Jessica
[SHK] And ceremoniously let us prepare
[SHK] Some welcome for the mistress of the house
[SHK] Sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
[SHK] Who calls
[SHK] Sola did you see Master Lorenzo
[SHK] Master Lorenzo sola sola
[SHK] Leave hollaing man here
[SHK] Sola where where
[SHK] Here
[SHK] Tell him there 's a post come from my master with
[SHK] his horn full of good news my master will be here
[SHK] ere morning
[SHK] Sweet soul let 's in and there expect their coming
[SHK] And yet no matter why should we go in
[SHK] My friend Stephano signify I pray you
[SHK] Within the house your mistress is at hand
[SHK] And bring your music forth into the air
[SHK] How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
[SHK] Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
[SHK] Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
[SHK] Become the touches of sweet harmony
[SHK] Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven
[SHK] Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
[SHK] There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
[SHK] But in his motion like an angel sings
[SHK] Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins
[SHK] Such harmony is in immortal souls
[SHK] But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
[SHK] Doth grossly close it in we can not hear it
[SHK] Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn
[SHK] With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear
[SHK] And draw her home with music
[SHK] I am never merry when I hear sweet music
[SHK] The reason is your spirits are attentive
[SHK] For do but note a wild and wanton herd
[SHK] Or race of youthful and unhandled colts
[SHK] Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
[SHK] Which is the hot condition of their blood
[SHK] If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
[SHK] Or any air of music touch their ears
[SHK] You shall perceive them make a mutual stand
[SHK] Their savage eyes turn 'd to a modest gaze
[SHK] By the sweet power of music therefore the poet
[SHK] Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods
[SHK] Since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
[SHK] But music for the time doth change his nature
[SHK] The man that hath no music in himself
[SHK] Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds
[SHK] Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
[SHK] The motions of his spirit are dull as night
[SHK] And his affections dark as Erebus
[SHK] Let no such man be trusted Mark the music
[SHK] That light we see is burning in my hall
[SHK] How far that little candle throws his beams
[SHK] So shines a good deed in a naughty world
[SHK] When the moon shone we did not see the candle
[SHK] So doth the greater glory dim the less
[SHK] A substitute shines brightly as a king
[SHK] Unto the king be by and then his state
[SHK] Empties itself as doth an inland brook
[SHK] Into the main of waters Music hark
[SHK] It is your music madam of the house
[SHK] Nothing is good I see without respect
[SHK] Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
[SHK] Silence bestows that virtue on it madam
[SHK] The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
[SHK] When neither is attended and I think
[SHK] The nightingale if she should sing by day
[SHK] When every goose is cackling would be thought
[SHK] No better a musician than the wren
[SHK] How many things by season season 'd are
[SHK] To their right praise and true perfection
[SHK] Peace ho the moon sleeps with Endymion
[SHK] And would not be awaked
[SHK] That is the voice
[SHK] Or I am much deceived of Portia
[SHK] He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
[SHK] By the bad voice
[SHK] Dear lady welcome home
[SHK] We have been praying for our husbands healths
[SHK] Which speed we hope the better for our words
[SHK] Are they return 'd
[SHK] Madam they are not yet
[SHK] But there is come a messenger before
[SHK] To signify their coming
[SHK] Go in Nerissa
[SHK] Give order to my servants that they take
[SHK] No note at all of our being absent hence
[SHK] Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you
[SHK] Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet
[SHK] We are no tell-tales madam fear you not
[SHK] This night methinks is but the daylight sick
[SHK] It looks a little paler 't is a day
[SHK] Such as the day is when the sun is hid
[SHK] We should hold day with the Antipodes
[SHK] If you would walk in absence of the sun
[SHK] Let me give light but let me not be light
[SHK] For a light wife doth make a heavy husband
[SHK] And never be Bassanio so for me
[SHK] But God sort all You are welcome home my lord
[SHK] I thank you madam Give welcome to my friend
[SHK] This is the man this is Antonio
[SHK] To whom I am so infinitely bound
[SHK] You should in all sense be much bound to him
[SHK] For as I hear he was much bound for you
[SHK] No more than I am well acquitted of
[SHK] Sir you are very welcome to our house
[SHK] It must appear in other ways than words
[SHK] Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy
[SHK] In faith I gave it to the judge 's clerk
[SHK] Would he were gelt that had it for my part
[SHK] Since you do take it love so much at heart
[SHK] A quarrel ho already what 's the matter
[SHK] About a hoop of gold a paltry ring
[SHK] That she did give me whose posy was
[SHK] For all the world like cutler 's poetry
[SHK] Upon a knife 'Love me and leave me not
[SHK] What talk you of the posy or the value
[SHK] You swore to me when I did give it you
[SHK] That you would wear it till your hour of death
[SHK] And that it should lie with you in your grave
[SHK] Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
[SHK] You should have been respective and have kept it
[SHK] Gave it a judge 's clerk no God 's my judge
[SHK] The clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it
[SHK] He will an if he live to be a man
[SHK] Ay if a woman live to be a man
[SHK] Now by this hand I gave it to a youth
[SHK] A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
[SHK] No higher than thyself the judge 's clerk
[SHK] A prating boy that begg 'd it as a fee
[SHK] I could not for my heart deny it him
[SHK] You were to blame I must be plain with you
[SHK] To part so slightly with your wife 's first gift
[SHK] A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
[SHK] And so riveted with faith unto your flesh
[SHK] I gave my love a ring and made him swear
[SHK] Never to part with it and here he stands
[SHK] I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
[SHK] Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
[SHK] That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano
[SHK] You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
[SHK] An 'twere to me I should be mad at it
[SHK] And swear I lost the ring defending it
[SHK] My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
[SHK] Unto the judge that begg 'd it and indeed
[SHK] Deserved it too and then the boy his clerk
[SHK] That took some pains in writing he begg 'd mine
[SHK] And neither man nor master would take aught
[SHK] But the two rings
[SHK] What ring gave you my lord
[SHK] Not that I hope which you received of me
[SHK] If I could add a lie unto a fault
[SHK] I would deny it but you see my finger
[SHK] Hath not the ring upon it it is gone
[SHK] Even so void is your false heart of truth
[SHK] By heaven I will ne'er come in your bed
[SHK] Until I see the ring
[SHK] Nor I in yours
[SHK] Till I again see mine
[SHK] Sweet Portia
[SHK] If you did know to whom I gave the ring
[SHK] If you did know for whom I gave the ring
[SHK] And would conceive for what I gave the ring
[SHK] And how unwillingly I left the ring
[SHK] When nought would be accepted but the ring
[SHK] You would abate the strength of your displeasure
[SHK] If you had known the virtue of the ring
[SHK] Or half her worthiness that gave the ring
[SHK] Or your own honour to contain the ring
[SHK] You would not then have parted with the ring
[SHK] What man is there so much unreasonable
[SHK] If you had pleased to have defended it
[SHK] With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
[SHK] To urge the thing held as a ceremony
[SHK] Nerissa teaches me what to believe
[SHK] I 'll die for't but some woman had the ring
[SHK] No by my honour madam by my soul
[SHK] No woman had it but a civil doctor
[SHK] Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
[SHK] And begg 'd the ring the which I did deny him
[SHK] And suffer 'd him to go displeased away
[SHK] Even he that did uphold the very life
[SHK] Of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady
[SHK] I was enforced to send it after him
[SHK] I was beset with shame and courtesy
[SHK] My honour would not let ingratitude
[SHK] So much besmear it Pardon me good lady
[SHK] For by these blessed candles of the night
[SHK] Had you been there I think you would have begg 'd
[SHK] The ring of me to give the worthy doctor
[SHK] Let not that doctor e'er come near my house
[SHK] Since he hath got the jewel that I loved
[SHK] And that which you did swear to keep for me
[SHK] I will become as liberal as you
[SHK] I 'll not deny him any thing I have
[SHK] No not my body nor my husband 's bed
[SHK] Know him I shall I am well sure of it
[SHK] Lie not a night from home watch me like Argus
[SHK] If you do not if I be left alone
[SHK] Now by mine honour which is yet mine own
[SHK] I 'll have that doctor for my bedfellow
[SHK] And I his clerk therefore be well advised
[SHK] How you do leave me to mine own protection
[SHK] Well do you so let not me take him then
[SHK] For if I do I 'll mar the young clerk 's pen
[SHK] I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
[SHK] Sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
[SHK] Portia forgive me this enforced wrong
[SHK] And in the hearing of these many friends
[SHK] I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
[SHK] Wherein I see myself --
[SHK] Mark you but that
[SHK] In both my eyes he doubly sees himself
[SHK] In each eye one swear by your double self
[SHK] And there 's an oath of credit
[SHK] Nay but hear me
[SHK] Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear
[SHK] I never more will break an oath with thee
[SHK] I once did lend my body for his wealth
[SHK] Which but for him that had your husband 's ring
[SHK] Had quite miscarried I dare be bound again
[SHK] My soul upon the forfeit that your lord
[SHK] Will never more break faith advisedly
[SHK] Then you shall be his surety Give him this
[SHK] And bid him keep it better than the other
[SHK] Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring
[SHK] By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor
[SHK] I had it of him pardon me Bassanio
[SHK] For by this ring the doctor lay with me
[SHK] And pardon me my gentle Gratiano
[SHK] For that same scrubbed boy the doctor 's clerk
[SHK] In lieu of this last night did lie with me
[SHK] Why this is like the mending of highways
[SHK] In summer where the ways are fair enough
[SHK] What are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
[SHK] Speak not so grossly You are all amazed
[SHK] Here is a letter read it at your leisure
[SHK] It comes from Padua from Bellario
[SHK] There you shall find that Portia was the doctor
[SHK] Nerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here
[SHK] Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
[SHK] And even but now return 'd I have not yet
[SHK] Enter 'd my house Antonio you are welcome
[SHK] And I have better news in store for you
[SHK] Than you expect unseal this letter soon
[SHK] There you shall find three of your argosies
[SHK] Are richly come to harbour suddenly
[SHK] You shall not know by what strange accident
[SHK] I chanced on this letter
[SHK] I am dumb
[SHK] Were you the doctor and I knew you not
[SHK] Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
[SHK] Ay but the clerk that never means to do it
[SHK] Unless he live until he be a man
[SHK] Sweet doctor you shall be my bed-fellow
[SHK] When I am absent then lie with my wife
[SHK] Sweet lady you have given me life and living
[SHK] For here I read for certain that my ships
[SHK] Are safely come to road
[SHK] How now Lorenzo
[SHK] My clerk hath some good comforts too for you
[SHK] Ay and I 'll give them him without a fee
[SHK] There do I give to you and Jessica
[SHK] From the rich Jew a special deed of gift
[SHK] After his death of all he dies possess 'd of
[SHK] Fair ladies you drop manna in the way
[SHK] Of starved people
[SHK] It is almost morning
[SHK] And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
[SHK] Of these events at full Let us go in
[SHK] And charge us there upon inter'gatories
[SHK] And we will answer all things faithfully
[SHK] Let it be so the first inter'gatory
[SHK] That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is
[SHK] Whether till the next night she had rather stay
[SHK] Or go to bed now being two hours to day
[SHK] But were the day come I should wish it dark
[SHK] That I were couching with the doctor 's clerk
[SHK] Well while I live I 'll fear no other thing
[SHK] So sore as keeping safe Nerissa 's ring
[SHK] Tush never tell me I take it much unkindly
[SHK] That thou Iago who hast had my purse
[SHK] As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
[SHK] 'Sblood but you will not hear me
[SHK] If ever I did dream of such a matter Abhor me
[SHK] Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate
[SHK] Despise me if I do not Three great ones of the city
[SHK] In personal suit to make me his lieutenant
[SHK] Off-capp 'd to him and by the faith of man
[SHK] I know my price I am worth no worse a place
[SHK] But he as loving his own pride and purposes
[SHK] Evades them with a bombast circumstance
[SHK] Horribly stuff 'd with epithets of war
[SHK] And in conclusion
[SHK] Nonsuits my mediators for 'Certes says he
[SHK] I have already chose my officer
[SHK] And what was he
[SHK] Forsooth a great arithmetician
[SHK] One Michael Cassio a Florentine
[SHK] A fellow almost damn 'd in a fair wife
[SHK] That never set a squadron in the field
[SHK] Nor the division of a battle knows
[SHK] More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
[SHK] Wherein the toged consuls can propose
[SHK] As masterly as he mere prattle without practise
[SHK] Is all his soldiership But he sir had the election
[SHK] And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof
[SHK] At Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds
[SHK] Christian and heathen must be be-lee 'd and calm 'd
[SHK] By debitor and creditor this counter-caster
[SHK] He in good time must his lieutenant be
[SHK] And I -- God bless the mark -- his Moorship 's ancient
[SHK] By heaven I rather would have been his hangman
[SHK] Why there 's no remedy 't is the curse of service
[SHK] Preferment goes by letter and affection
[SHK] And not by old gradation where each second
[SHK] Stood heir to the first Now sir be judge yourself
[SHK] Whether I in any just term am affined
[SHK] To love the Moor
[SHK] I would not follow him then
[SHK] O sir content you
[SHK] I follow him to serve my turn upon him
[SHK] We can not all be masters nor all masters
[SHK] Can not be truly follow 'd You shall mark
[SHK] Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave
[SHK] That doting on his own obsequious bondage
[SHK] Wears out his time much like his master 's ass
[SHK] For nought but provender and when he 's old cashier 'd
[SHK] Whip me such honest knaves Others there are
[SHK] Who trimm 'd in forms and visages of duty
[SHK] Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
[SHK] And throwing but shows of service on their lords
[SHK] Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
[SHK] their coats
[SHK] Do themselves homage these fellows have some soul
[SHK] And such a one do I profess myself For sir
[SHK] It is as sure as you are Roderigo
[SHK] Were I the Moor I would not be Iago
[SHK] In following him I follow but myself
[SHK] Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty
[SHK] But seeming so for my peculiar end
[SHK] For when my outward action doth demonstrate
[SHK] The native act and figure of my heart
[SHK] In compliment extern 't is not long after
[SHK] But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
[SHK] For daws to peck at I am not what I am
[SHK] What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
[SHK] If he can carry't thus
[SHK] Call up her father
[SHK] Rouse him make after him poison his delight
[SHK] Proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
[SHK] And though he in a fertile climate dwell
[SHK] Plague him with flies though that his joy be joy
[SHK] Yet throw such changes of vexation o n't
[SHK] As it may lose some colour
[SHK] Here is her father 's house I 'll call aloud
[SHK] Do with like timorous accent and dire yell
[SHK] As when by night and negligence the fire
[SHK] Is spied in populous cities
[SHK] What ho Brabantio Signior Brabantio ho
[SHK] Awake what ho Brabantio thieves thieves thieves
[SHK] Look to your house your daughter and your bags
[SHK] Thieves thieves
[SHK] What is the reason of this terrible summons
[SHK] What is the matter there
[SHK] Signior is all your family within
[SHK] Are your doors lock 'd
[SHK] Why wherefore ask you this
[SHK] 'Zounds sir you 're robb 'd for shame put on
[SHK] your gown
[SHK] Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul
[SHK] Even now now very now an old black ram
[SHK] Is topping your white ewe Arise arise
[SHK] Awake the snorting citizens with the bell
[SHK] Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you
[SHK] Arise I say
[SHK] What have you lost your wits
[SHK] Most reverend signior do you know my voice
[SHK] Not I what are you
[SHK] My name is Roderigo
[SHK] The worser welcome
[SHK] I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
[SHK] In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
[SHK] My daughter is not for thee and now in madness
[SHK] Being full of supper and distempering draughts
[SHK] Upon malicious bravery dost thou come
[SHK] To start my quiet
[SHK] Sir sir sir --
[SHK] But thou must needs be sure
[SHK] My spirit and my place have in them power
[SHK] To make this bitter to thee
[SHK] Patience good sir
[SHK] What tell'st thou me of robbing this is Venice
[SHK] My house is not a grange
[SHK] Most grave Brabantio
[SHK] In simple and pure soul I come to you
[SHK] 'Zounds sir you are one of those that will not
[SHK] serve God if the devil bid you Because we come to
[SHK] do you service and you think we are ruffians you 'll
[SHK] have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse
[SHK] you 'll have your nephews neigh to you you 'll have
[SHK] coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
[SHK] What profane wretch art thou
[SHK] I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter
[SHK] and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs
[SHK] Thou art a villain
[SHK] You are -- a senator
[SHK] This thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo
[SHK] Sir I will answer any thing But I beseech you
[SHK] If't be your pleasure and most wise consent
[SHK] As partly I find it is that your fair daughter
[SHK] At this odd-even and dull watch o the night
[SHK] Transported with no worse nor better guard
[SHK] But with a knave of common hire a gondolier
[SHK] To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor --
[SHK] If this be known to you and your allowance
[SHK] We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
[SHK] But if you know not this my manners tell me
[SHK] We have your wrong rebuke Do not believe
[SHK] That from the sense of all civility
[SHK] I thus would play and trifle with your reverence
[SHK] Your daughter if you have not given her leave
[SHK] I say again hath made a gross revolt
[SHK] Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
[SHK] In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
[SHK] Of here and every where Straight satisfy yourself
[SHK] If she be in her chamber or your house
[SHK] Let loose on me the justice of the state
[SHK] For thus deluding you
[SHK] Strike on the tinder ho
[SHK] Give me a taper call up all my people
[SHK] This accident is not unlike my dream
[SHK] Belief of it oppresses me already
[SHK] Light I say light
[SHK] Farewell for I must leave you
[SHK] It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
[SHK] To be produced -- as if I stay I shall --
[SHK] Against the Moor for I do know the state
[SHK] However this may gall him with some cheque
[SHK] Can not with safety cast him for he 's embark 'd
[SHK] With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
[SHK] Which even now stand in act that for their souls
[SHK] Another of his fathom they have none
[SHK] To lead their business in which regard
[SHK] Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains
[SHK] Yet for necessity of present life
[SHK] I must show out a flag and sign of love
[SHK] Which is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him
[SHK] Lead to the Sagittary the raised search
[SHK] And there will I be with him So farewell
[SHK] It is too true an evil gone she is
[SHK] And what 's to come of my despised time
[SHK] Is nought but bitterness Now Roderigo
[SHK] Where didst thou see her O unhappy girl
[SHK] With the Moor say'st thou Who would be a father
[SHK] How didst thou know 't was she O she deceives me
[SHK] Past thought What said she to you Get more tapers
[SHK] Raise all my kindred Are they married think you
[SHK] Truly I think they are
[SHK] O heaven How got she out O treason of the blood
[SHK] Fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds
[SHK] By what you see them act Is there not charms
[SHK] By which the property of youth and maidhood
[SHK] May be abused Have you not read Roderigo
[SHK] Of some such thing
[SHK] Yes sir I have indeed
[SHK] Call up my brother O would you had had her
[SHK] Some one way some another Do you know
[SHK] Where we may apprehend her and the Moor
[SHK] I think I can discover him if you please
[SHK] To get good guard and go along with me
[SHK] Pray you lead on At every house I 'll call
[SHK] I may command at most Get weapons ho
[SHK] And raise some special officers of night
[SHK] On good Roderigo I 'll deserve your pains
[SHK] Though in the trade of war I have slain men
[SHK] Yet do I hold it very stuff o the conscience
[SHK] To do no contrived murder I lack iniquity
[SHK] Sometimes to do me service nine or ten times
[SHK] I had thought to have yerk 'd him here under the ribs
[SHK] 'T is better as it is
[SHK] Nay but he prated
[SHK] And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
[SHK] Against your honour
[SHK] That with the little godliness I have
[SHK] I did full hard forbear him But I pray you sir
[SHK] Are you fast married Be assured of this
[SHK] That the magnifico is much beloved
[SHK] And hath in his effect a voice potential
[SHK] As double as the duke 's he will divorce you
[SHK] Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
[SHK] The law with all his might to enforce it on
[SHK] Will give him cable
[SHK] Let him do his spite
[SHK] My services which I have done the signiory
[SHK] Shall out-tongue his complaints 'T is yet to know --
[SHK] Which when I know that boasting is an honour
[SHK] I shall promulgate -- I fetch my life and being
[SHK] From men of royal siege and my demerits
[SHK] May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
[SHK] As this that I have reach 'd for know Iago
[SHK] But that I love the gentle Desdemona
[SHK] I would not my unhoused free condition
[SHK] Put into circumscription and confine
[SHK] For the sea 's worth But look what lights come yond
[SHK] Those are the raised father and his friends
[SHK] You were best go in
[SHK] Not I I must be found
[SHK] My parts my title and my perfect soul
[SHK] Shall manifest me rightly Is it they
[SHK] By Janus I think no
[SHK] The servants of the duke and my lieutenant
[SHK] The goodness of the night upon you friends
[SHK] What is the news
[SHK] The duke does greet you general
[SHK] And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance
[SHK] Even on the instant
[SHK] What is the matter think you
[SHK] Something from Cyprus as I may divine
[SHK] It is a business of some heat the galleys
[SHK] Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
[SHK] This very night at one another 's heels
[SHK] And many of the consuls raised and met
[SHK] Are at the duke 's already you have been
[SHK] hotly call 'd for
[SHK] When being not at your lodging to be found
[SHK] The senate hath sent about three several guests
[SHK] To search you out
[SHK] 'T is well I am found by you
[SHK] I will but spend a word here in the house
[SHK] And go with you
[SHK] Ancient what makes he here
[SHK] 'Faith he to-night hath boarded a land carack
[SHK] If it prove lawful prize he 's made for ever
[SHK] I do not understand
[SHK] He 's married
[SHK] To who
[SHK] Marry to -- Come captain will you go
[SHK] Have with you
[SHK] Here comes another troop to seek for you
[SHK] It is Brabantio General be advised
[SHK] He comes to bad intent
[SHK] Holla stand there
[SHK] Signior it is the Moor
[SHK] Down with him thief
[SHK] You Roderigo come sir I am for you
[SHK] Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
[SHK] Good signior you shall more command with years
[SHK] Than with your weapons
[SHK] O thou foul thief where hast thou stow 'd my daughter
[SHK] Damn 'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
[SHK] For I 'll refer me to all things of sense
[SHK] If she in chains of magic were not bound
[SHK] Whether a maid so tender fair and happy
[SHK] So opposite to marriage that she shunned
[SHK] The wealthy curled darlings of our nation
[SHK] Would ever have to incur a general mock
[SHK] Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
[SHK] Of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
[SHK] Judge me the world if 't is not gross in sense
[SHK] That thou hast practised on her with foul charms
[SHK] Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
[SHK] That weaken motion I 'll have't disputed on
[SHK] 'T is probable and palpable to thinking
[SHK] I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
[SHK] For an abuser of the world a practiser
[SHK] Of arts inhibited and out of warrant
[SHK] Lay hold upon him if he do resist
[SHK] Subdue him at his peril
[SHK] Hold your hands
[SHK] Both you of my inclining and the rest
[SHK] Were it my cue to fight I should have known it
[SHK] Without a prompter Where will you that I go
[SHK] To answer this your charge
[SHK] To prison till fit time
[SHK] Of law and course of direct session
[SHK] Call thee to answer
[SHK] What if I do obey
[SHK] How may the duke be therewith satisfied
[SHK] Whose messengers are here about my side
[SHK] Upon some present business of the state
[SHK] To bring me to him
[SHK] 'T is true most worthy signior
[SHK] The duke 's in council and your noble self
[SHK] I am sure is sent for
[SHK] How the duke in council
[SHK] In this time of the night Bring him away
[SHK] Mine 's not an idle cause the duke himself
[SHK] Or any of my brothers of the state
[SHK] Can not but feel this wrong as 'twere their own
[SHK] For if such actions may have passage free
[SHK] Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be
[SHK] There is no composition in these news
[SHK] That gives them credit
[SHK] Indeed they are disproportion 'd
[SHK] My letters say a hundred and seven galleys
[SHK] And mine a hundred and forty
[SHK] And mine two hundred
[SHK] But though they jump not on a just account --
[SHK] As in these cases where the aim reports
[SHK] 'T is oft with difference -- yet do they all confirm
[SHK] A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus
[SHK] Nay it is possible enough to judgment
[SHK] I do not so secure me in the error
[SHK] But the main article I do approve
[SHK] In fearful sense
[SHK] A messenger from the galleys
[SHK] Now what 's the business
[SHK] The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes
[SHK] So was I bid report here to the state
[SHK] By Signior Angelo
[SHK] How say you by this change
[SHK] This can not be
[SHK] By no assay of reason 't is a pageant
[SHK] To keep us in false gaze When we consider
[SHK] The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk
[SHK] And let ourselves again but understand
[SHK] That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes
[SHK] So may he with more facile question bear it
[SHK] For that it stands not in such warlike brace
[SHK] But altogether lacks the abilities
[SHK] That Rhodes is dress 'd in if we make thought of this
[SHK] We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
[SHK] To leave that latest which concerns him first
[SHK] Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
[SHK] To wake and wage a danger profitless
[SHK] Nay in all confidence he 's not for Rhodes
[SHK] Here is more news
[SHK] The Ottomites reverend and gracious
[SHK] Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes
[SHK] Have there injointed them with an after fleet
[SHK] Ay so I thought How many as you guess
[SHK] Of thirty sail and now they do restem
[SHK] Their backward course bearing with frank appearance
[SHK] Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
[SHK] Your trusty and most valiant servitor
[SHK] With his free duty recommends you thus
[SHK] And prays you to believe him
[SHK] 'T is certain then for Cyprus
[SHK] Marcus Luccicos is not he in town
[SHK] He 's now in Florence
[SHK] Write from us to him post-post-haste dispatch
[SHK] Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor
[SHK] Valiant Othello we must straight employ you
[SHK] Against the general enemy Ottoman
[SHK] I did not see you welcome gentle signior
[SHK] We lack 'd your counsel and your help tonight
[SHK] So did I yours Good your grace pardon me
[SHK] Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
[SHK] Hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
[SHK] Take hold on me for my particular grief
[SHK] Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
[SHK] That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
[SHK] And it is still itself
[SHK] Why what 's the matter
[SHK] My daughter O my daughter
[SHK] Dead
[SHK] Ay to me
[SHK] She is abused stol'n from me and corrupted
[SHK] By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
[SHK] For nature so preposterously to err
[SHK] Being not deficient blind or lame of sense
[SHK] Sans witchcraft could not
[SHK] Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
[SHK] Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
[SHK] And you of her the bloody book of law
[SHK] You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
[SHK] After your own sense yea though our proper son
[SHK] Stood in your action
[SHK] Humbly I thank your grace
[SHK] Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems
[SHK] Your special mandate for the state-affairs
[SHK] Hath hither brought
[SHK] We are very sorry for't
[SHK] Nothing but this is so
[SHK] Most potent grave and reverend signiors
[SHK] My very noble and approved good masters
[SHK] That I have ta'en away this old man 's daughter
[SHK] It is most true true I have married her
[SHK] The very head and front of my offending
[SHK] Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
[SHK] And little bless 'd with the soft phrase of peace
[SHK] For since these arms of mine had seven years pith
[SHK] Till now some nine moons wasted they have used
[SHK] Their dearest action in the tented field
[SHK] And little of this great world can I speak
[SHK] More than pertains to feats of broil and battle
[SHK] And therefore little shall I grace my cause
[SHK] In speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience
[SHK] I will a round unvarnish 'd tale deliver
[SHK] Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
[SHK] What conjuration and what mighty magic
[SHK] For such proceeding I am charged withal
[SHK] I won his daughter
[SHK] A maiden never bold
[SHK] Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
[SHK] Blush 'd at herself and she in spite of nature
[SHK] Of years of country credit every thing
[SHK] To fall in love with what she fear 'd to look on
[SHK] It is a judgment maim 'd and most imperfect
[SHK] That will confess perfection so could err
[SHK] Against all rules of nature and must be driven
[SHK] To find out practises of cunning hell
[SHK] Why this should be I therefore vouch again
[SHK] That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood
[SHK] Or with some dram conjured to this effect
[SHK] He wrought upon her
[SHK] To vouch this is no proof
[SHK] Without more wider and more overt test
[SHK] Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
[SHK] Of modern seeming do prefer against him
[SHK] But Othello speak
[SHK] Did you by indirect and forced courses
[SHK] Subdue and poison this young maid 's affections
[SHK] Or came it by request and such fair question
[SHK] As soul to soul affordeth
[SHK] I do beseech you
[SHK] Send for the lady to the Sagittary
[SHK] And let her speak of me before her father
[SHK] If you do find me foul in her report
[SHK] The trust the office I do hold of you
[SHK] Not only take away but let your sentence
[SHK] Even fall upon my life
[SHK] Fetch Desdemona hither
[SHK] Ancient conduct them you best know the place
[SHK] And till she come as truly as to heaven
[SHK] I do confess the vices of my blood
[SHK] So justly to your grave ears I 'll present
[SHK] How I did thrive in this fair lady 's love
[SHK] And she in mine
[SHK] Say it Othello
[SHK] Her father loved me oft invited me
[SHK] Still question 'd me the story of my life
[SHK] From year to year the battles sieges fortunes
[SHK] That I have passed
[SHK] I ran it through even from my boyish days
[SHK] To the very moment that he bade me tell it
[SHK] Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances
[SHK] Of moving accidents by flood and field
[SHK] Of hair-breadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach
[SHK] Of being taken by the insolent foe
[SHK] And sold to slavery of my redemption thence
[SHK] And portance in my travels history
[SHK] Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
[SHK] Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
[SHK] It was my hint to speak -- such was the process
[SHK] And of the Cannibals that each other eat
[SHK] The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
[SHK] Do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear
[SHK] Would Desdemona seriously incline
[SHK] But still the house-affairs would draw her thence
[SHK] Which ever as she could with haste dispatch
[SHK] She'ld come again and with a greedy ear
[SHK] Devour up my discourse which I observing
[SHK] Took once a pliant hour and found good means
[SHK] To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
[SHK] That I would all my pilgrimage dilate
[SHK] Whereof by parcels she had something heard
[SHK] But not intentively I did consent
[SHK] And often did beguile her of her tears
[SHK] When I did speak of some distressful stroke
[SHK] That my youth suffer 'd My story being done
[SHK] She gave me for my pains a world of sighs
[SHK] She swore in faith twas strange 't was passing strange
[SHK] 'T was pitiful 't was wondrous pitiful
[SHK] She wish 'd she had not heard it yet she wish 'd
[SHK] That heaven had made her such a man she thank 'd me
[SHK] And bade me if I had a friend that loved her
[SHK] I should but teach him how to tell my story
[SHK] And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake
[SHK] She loved me for the dangers I had pass 'd
[SHK] And I loved her that she did pity them
[SHK] This only is the witchcraft I have used
[SHK] Here comes the lady let her witness it
[SHK] I think this tale would win my daughter too
[SHK] Good Brabantio
[SHK] Take up this mangled matter at the best
[SHK] Men do their broken weapons rather use
[SHK] Than their bare hands
[SHK] I pray you hear her speak
[SHK] If she confess that she was half the wooer
[SHK] Destruction on my head if my bad blame
[SHK] Light on the man Come hither gentle mistress
[SHK] Do you perceive in all this noble company
[SHK] Where most you owe obedience
[SHK] My noble father
[SHK] I do perceive here a divided duty
[SHK] To you I am bound for life and education
[SHK] My life and education both do learn me
[SHK] How to respect you you are the lord of duty
[SHK] I am hitherto your daughter but here 's my husband
[SHK] And so much duty as my mother show 'd
[SHK] To you preferring you before her father
[SHK] So much I challenge that I may profess
[SHK] Due to the Moor my lord
[SHK] God be wi you I have done
[SHK] Please it your grace on to the state-affairs
[SHK] I had rather to adopt a child than get it
[SHK] Come hither Moor
[SHK] I here do give thee that with all my heart
[SHK] Which but thou hast already with all my heart
[SHK] I would keep from thee For your sake jewel
[SHK] I am glad at soul I have no other child
[SHK] For thy escape would teach me tyranny
[SHK] To hang clogs on them I have done my lord
[SHK] Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
[SHK] Which as a grise or step may help these lovers
[SHK] Into your favour
[SHK] When remedies are past the griefs are ended
[SHK] By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
[SHK] To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
[SHK] Is the next way to draw new mischief on
[SHK] What can not be preserved when fortune takes
[SHK] Patience her injury a mockery makes
[SHK] The robb 'd that smiles steals something from the thief
[SHK] He robs himself that spends a bootless grief
[SHK] So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile
[SHK] We lose it not so long as we can smile
[SHK] He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
[SHK] But the free comfort which from thence he hears
[SHK] But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
[SHK] That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
[SHK] These sentences to sugar or to gall
[SHK] Being strong on both sides are equivocal
[SHK] But words are words I never yet did hear
[SHK] That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear
[SHK] I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
[SHK] The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
[SHK] Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best
[SHK] known to you and though we have there a substitute
[SHK] of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a
[SHK] sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
[SHK] voice on you you must therefore be content to
[SHK] slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
[SHK] more stubborn and boisterous expedition
[SHK] The tyrant custom most grave senators
[SHK] Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
[SHK] My thrice-driven bed of down I do agnise
[SHK] A natural and prompt alacrity
[SHK] I find in hardness and do undertake
[SHK] These present wars against the Ottomites
[SHK] Most humbly therefore bending to your state
[SHK] I crave fit disposition for my wife
[SHK] Due reference of place and exhibition
[SHK] With such accommodation and besort
[SHK] As levels with her breeding
[SHK] If you please
[SHK] Be't at her father 's
[SHK] I 'll not have it so
[SHK] Nor I
[SHK] Nor I I would not there reside
[SHK] To put my father in impatient thoughts
[SHK] By being in his eye Most gracious duke
[SHK] To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
[SHK] And let me find a charter in your voice
[SHK] To assist my simpleness
[SHK] What would You Desdemona
[SHK] That I did love the Moor to live with him
[SHK] My downright violence and storm of fortunes
[SHK] May trumpet to the world my heart 's subdued
[SHK] Even to the very quality of my lord
[SHK] I saw Othello 's visage in his mind
[SHK] And to his honour and his valiant parts
[SHK] Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate
[SHK] So that dear lords if I be left behind
[SHK] A moth of peace and he go to the war
[SHK] The rites for which I love him are bereft me
[SHK] And I a heavy interim shall support
[SHK] By his dear absence Let me go with him
[SHK] Let her have your voices
[SHK] Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not
[SHK] To please the palate of my appetite
[SHK] Nor to comply with heat -- the young affects
[SHK] In me defunct -- and proper satisfaction
[SHK] But to be free and bounteous to her mind
[SHK] And heaven defend your good souls that you think
[SHK] I will your serious and great business scant
[SHK] For she is with me no when light-wing 'd toys
[SHK] Of feather 'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
[SHK] My speculative and officed instruments
[SHK] That my disports corrupt and taint my business
[SHK] Let housewives make a skillet of my helm
[SHK] And all indign and base adversities
[SHK] Make head against my estimation
[SHK] Be it as you shall privately determine
[SHK] Either for her stay or going the affair cries haste
[SHK] And speed must answer it
[SHK] You must away to-night
[SHK] With all my heart
[SHK] At nine i the morning here we 'll meet again
[SHK] Othello leave some officer behind
[SHK] And he shall our commission bring to you
[SHK] With such things else of quality and respect
[SHK] As doth import you
[SHK] So please your grace my ancient
[SHK] A man he is of honest and trust
[SHK] To his conveyance I assign my wife
[SHK] With what else needful your good grace shall think
[SHK] To be sent after me
[SHK] Let it be so
[SHK] Good night to every one
[SHK] And noble signior
[SHK] If virtue no delighted beauty lack
[SHK] Your son-in-law is far more fair than black
[SHK] Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well
[SHK] Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see
[SHK] She has deceived her father and may thee
[SHK] My life upon her faith Honest Iago
[SHK] My Desdemona must I leave to thee
[SHK] I prithee let thy wife attend on her
[SHK] And bring them after in the best advantage
[SHK] Come Desdemona I have but an hour
[SHK] Of love of worldly matters and direction
[SHK] To spend with thee we must obey the time
[SHK] Iago --
[SHK] What say'st thou noble heart
[SHK] What will I do thinkest thou
[SHK] Why go to bed and sleep
[SHK] I will incontinently drown myself
[SHK] If thou dost I shall never love thee after Why
[SHK] thou silly gentleman
[SHK] It is silliness to live when to live is torment and
[SHK] then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
[SHK] O villainous I have looked upon the world for four
[SHK] times seven years and since I could distinguish
[SHK] betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man
[SHK] that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I
[SHK] would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen I
[SHK] would change my humanity with a baboon
[SHK] What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so
[SHK] fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
[SHK] Virtue a fig 't is in ourselves that we are thus
[SHK] or thus Our bodies are our gardens to the which
[SHK] our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant
[SHK] nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up
[SHK] thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or
[SHK] distract it with many either to have it sterile
[SHK] with idleness or manured with industry why the
[SHK] power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
[SHK] wills If the balance of our lives had not one
[SHK] scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the
[SHK] blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
[SHK] to most preposterous conclusions but we have
[SHK] reason to cool our raging motions our carnal
[SHK] stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that
[SHK] you call love to be a sect or scion
[SHK] It can not be
[SHK] It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
[SHK] the will Come be a man Drown thyself drown
[SHK] cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy
[SHK] friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
[SHK] cables of perdurable toughness I could never
[SHK] better stead thee than now Put money in thy
[SHK] purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with
[SHK] an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It
[SHK] can not be that Desdemona should long continue her
[SHK] love to the Moor -- put money in thy purse -- nor he
[SHK] his to her it was a violent commencement and thou
[SHK] shalt see an answerable sequestration -- put but
[SHK] money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in
[SHK] their wills fill thy purse with money -- the food
[SHK] that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be
[SHK] to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida She must
[SHK] change for youth when she is sated with his body
[SHK] she will find the error of her choice she must
[SHK] have change she must therefore put money in thy
[SHK] purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a
[SHK] more delicate way than drowning Make all the money
[SHK] thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
[SHK] an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
[SHK] too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou
[SHK] shalt enjoy her therefore make money A pox of
[SHK] drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek
[SHK] thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
[SHK] to be drowned and go without her
[SHK] Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on
[SHK] the issue
[SHK] Thou art sure of me -- go make money -- I have told
[SHK] thee often and I re-tell thee again and again I
[SHK] hate the Moor my cause is hearted thine hath no
[SHK] less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
[SHK] against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost
[SHK] thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many
[SHK] events in the womb of time which will be delivered
[SHK] Traverse go provide thy money We will have more
[SHK] of this to-morrow Adieu
[SHK] Where shall we meet i the morning
[SHK] At my lodging
[SHK] I 'll be with thee betimes
[SHK] Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo
[SHK] What say you
[SHK] No more of drowning do you hear
[SHK] I am changed I 'll go sell all my land
[SHK] Thus do I ever make my fool my purse
[SHK] For I mine own gain 'd knowledge should profane
[SHK] If I would time expend with such a snipe
[SHK] But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor
[SHK] And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets
[SHK] He has done my office I know not if't be true
[SHK] But I for mere suspicion in that kind
[SHK] Will do as if for surety He holds me well
[SHK] The better shall my purpose work on him
[SHK] Cassio 's a proper man let me see now
[SHK] To get his place and to plume up my will
[SHK] In double knavery -- How how Let 's see --
[SHK] After some time to abuse Othello 's ear
[SHK] That he is too familiar with his wife
[SHK] He hath a person and a smooth dispose
[SHK] To be suspected framed to make women false
[SHK] The Moor is of a free and open nature
[SHK] That thinks men honest that but seem to be so
[SHK] And will as tenderly be led by the nose
[SHK] As asses are
[SHK] I have't It is engender 'd Hell and night
[SHK] Must bring this monstrous birth to the world 's light
[SHK] What from the cape can you discern at sea
[SHK] Nothing at all it is a highwrought flood
[SHK] I can not 'twixt the heaven and the main
[SHK] Descry a sail
[SHK] Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
[SHK] A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements
[SHK] If it hath ruffian 'd so upon the sea
[SHK] What ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
[SHK] Can hold the mortise What shall we hear of this
[SHK] A segregation of the Turkish fleet
[SHK] For do but stand upon the foaming shore
[SHK] The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
[SHK] The wind-shaked surge with high and monstrous mane
[SHK] seems to cast water on the burning bear
[SHK] And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole
[SHK] I never did like molestation view
[SHK] On the enchafed flood
[SHK] If that the Turkish fleet
[SHK] Be not enshelter 'd and embay 'd they are drown 'd
[SHK] It is impossible they bear it out
[SHK] News lads our wars are done
[SHK] The desperate tempest hath so bang 'd the Turks
[SHK] That their designment halts a noble ship of Venice
[SHK] Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
[SHK] On most part of their fleet
[SHK] How is this true
[SHK] The ship is here put in
[SHK] A Veronesa Michael Cassio
[SHK] Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello
[SHK] Is come on shore the Moor himself at sea
[SHK] And is in full commission here for Cyprus
[SHK] I am glad o n't 't is a worthy governor
[SHK] But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort
[SHK] Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly
[SHK] And prays the Moor be safe for they were parted
[SHK] With foul and violent tempest
[SHK] Pray heavens he be
[SHK] For I have served him and the man commands
[SHK] Like a full soldier Let 's to the seaside ho
[SHK] As well to see the vessel that 's come in
[SHK] As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello
[SHK] Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
[SHK] An indistinct regard
[SHK] Come let 's do so
[SHK] For every minute is expectancy
[SHK] Of more arrivance
[SHK] Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
[SHK] That so approve the Moor O let the heavens
[SHK] Give him defence against the elements
[SHK] For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea
[SHK] Is he well shipp 'd
[SHK] His bark is stoutly timber 'd his pilot
[SHK] Of very expert and approved allowance
[SHK] Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
[SHK] Stand in bold cure
[SHK] What noise
[SHK] The town is empty on the brow o the sea
[SHK] Stand ranks of people and they cry A sail
[SHK] My hopes do shape him for the governor
[SHK] They do discharge their shot of courtesy
[SHK] Our friends at least
[SHK] I pray you sir go forth
[SHK] And give us truth who 't is that is arrived
[SHK] I shall
[SHK] But good lieutenant is your general wived
[SHK] Most fortunately he hath achieved a maid
[SHK] That paragons description and wild fame
[SHK] One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
[SHK] And in the essential vesture of creation
[SHK] Does tire the ingener
[SHK] How now who has put in
[SHK] 'T is one Iago ancient to the general
[SHK] Has had most favourable and happy speed
[SHK] Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
[SHK] The gutter 'd rocks and congregated sands --
[SHK] Traitors ensteep 'd to clog the guiltless keel --
[SHK] As having sense of beauty do omit
[SHK] Their mortal natures letting go safely by
[SHK] The divine Desdemona
[SHK] What is she
[SHK] She that I spake of our great captain 's captain
[SHK] Left in the conduct of the bold Iago
[SHK] Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
[SHK] A se'nnight 's speed Great Jove Othello guard
[SHK] And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
[SHK] That he may bless this bay with his tall ship
[SHK] Make love 's quick pants in Desdemona 's arms
[SHK] Give renew 'd fire to our extincted spirits
[SHK] And bring all Cyprus comfort
[SHK] O behold
[SHK] The riches of the ship is come on shore
[SHK] Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees
[SHK] Hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven
[SHK] Before behind thee and on every hand
[SHK] Enwheel thee round
[SHK] I thank you valiant Cassio
[SHK] What tidings can you tell me of my lord
[SHK] He is not yet arrived nor know I aught
[SHK] But that he 's well and will be shortly here
[SHK] O but I fear -- How lost you company
[SHK] The great contention of the sea and skies
[SHK] Parted our fellowship -- But hark a sail
[SHK] They give their greeting to the citadel
[SHK] This likewise is a friend
[SHK] See for the news
[SHK] Good ancient you are welcome
[SHK] Welcome mistress
[SHK] Let it not gall your patience good Iago
[SHK] That I extend my manners 't is my breeding
[SHK] That gives me this bold show of courtesy
[SHK] Sir would she give you so much of her lips
[SHK] As of her tongue she oft bestows on me
[SHK] You 'll have enough
[SHK] Alas she has no speech
[SHK] In faith too much
[SHK] I find it still when I have list to sleep
[SHK] Marry before your ladyship I grant
[SHK] She puts her tongue a little in her heart
[SHK] And chides with thinking
[SHK] You have little cause to say so
[SHK] Come on come on you are pictures out of doors
[SHK] Bells in your parlors wild-cats in your kitchens
[SHK] Saints m your injuries devils being offended
[SHK] Players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
[SHK] O fie upon thee slanderer
[SHK] Nay it is true or else I am a Turk
[SHK] You rise to play and go to bed to work
[SHK] You shall not write my praise
[SHK] No let me not
[SHK] What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
[SHK] praise me
[SHK] O gentle lady do not put me to't
[SHK] For I am nothing if not critical
[SHK] Come on assay There 's one gone to the harbour
[SHK] Ay madam
[SHK] I am not merry but I do beguile
[SHK] The thing I am by seeming otherwise
[SHK] Come how wouldst thou praise me
[SHK] I am about it but indeed my invention
[SHK] Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize
[SHK] It plucks out brains and all but my Muse labours
[SHK] And thus she is deliver 'd
[SHK] If she be fair and wise fairness and wit
[SHK] The one 's for use the other useth it
[SHK] Well praised How if she be black and witty
[SHK] If she be black and thereto have a wit
[SHK] She 'll find a white that shall her blackness fit
[SHK] Worse and worse
[SHK] How if fair and foolish
[SHK] She never yet was foolish that was fair
[SHK] For even her folly help 'd her to an heir
[SHK] These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i
[SHK] the alehouse What miserable praise hast thou for
[SHK] her that 's foul and foolish
[SHK] There 's none so foul and foolish thereunto
[SHK] But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
[SHK] O heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best
[SHK] But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
[SHK] woman indeed one that in the authority of her
[SHK] merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
[SHK] She that was ever fair and never proud
[SHK] Had tongue at will and yet was never loud
[SHK] Never lack 'd gold and yet went never gay
[SHK] Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may
[SHK] She that being anger 'd her revenge being nigh
[SHK] Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
[SHK] She that in wisdom never was so frail
[SHK] To change the cod 's head for the salmon 's tail
[SHK] She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind
[SHK] See suitors following and not look behind
[SHK] She was a wight if ever such wight were --
[SHK] To do what
[SHK] To suckle fools and chronicle small beer
[SHK] O most lame and impotent conclusion Do not learn
[SHK] of him Emilia though he be thy husband How say
[SHK] you Cassio is he not a most profane and liberal
[SHK] counsellor
[SHK] He speaks home madam You may relish him more in
[SHK] the soldier than in the scholar
[SHK] whisper with as little a web as this will I
[SHK] ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon
[SHK] her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship
[SHK] You say true 't is so indeed if such tricks as
[SHK] these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had
[SHK] been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
[SHK] oft which now again you are most apt to play the
[SHK] sir in Very good well kissed an excellent
[SHK] courtesy 't is so indeed Yet again your fingers
[SHK] to your lips would they were clyster-pipes for your sake
[SHK] The Moor I know his trumpet
[SHK] 'T is truly so
[SHK] Let 's meet him and receive him
[SHK] Lo where he comes
[SHK] O my fair warrior
[SHK] My dear Othello
[SHK] It gives me wonder great as my content
[SHK] To see you here before me O my soul 's joy
[SHK] If after every tempest come such calms
[SHK] May the winds blow till they have waken 'd death
[SHK] And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
[SHK] Olympus-high and duck again as low
[SHK] As hell 's from heaven If it were now to die
[SHK] 'Twere now to be most happy for I fear
[SHK] My soul hath her content so absolute
[SHK] That not another comfort like to this
[SHK] Succeeds in unknown fate
[SHK] The heavens forbid
[SHK] But that our loves and comforts should increase
[SHK] Even as our days do grow
[SHK] Amen to that sweet powers
[SHK] I can not speak enough of this content
[SHK] It stops me here it is too much of joy
[SHK] And this and this the greatest discords be
[SHK] That e'er our hearts shall make
[SHK] But I 'll set down the pegs that make this music
[SHK] As honest as I am
[SHK] Come let us to the castle
[SHK] News friends our wars are done the Turks
[SHK] are drown 'd
[SHK] How does my old acquaintance of this isle
[SHK] Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus
[SHK] I have found great love amongst them O my sweet
[SHK] I prattle out of fashion and I dote
[SHK] In mine own comforts I prithee good Iago
[SHK] Go to the bay and disembark my coffers
[SHK] Bring thou the master to the citadel
[SHK] He is a good one and his worthiness
[SHK] Does challenge much respect Come Desdemona
[SHK] Once more well met at Cyprus
[SHK] Do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come
[SHK] hither If thou be'st valiant -- as they say base
[SHK] men being in love have then a nobility in their
[SHK] natures more than is native to them -- list me The
[SHK] lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
[SHK] guard -- first I must tell thee this -- Desdemona is
[SHK] directly in love with him
[SHK] With him why 't is not possible
[SHK] Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
[SHK] Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor
[SHK] but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies
[SHK] and will she love him still for prating let not
[SHK] thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed
[SHK] and what delight shall she have to look on the
[SHK] devil When the blood is made dull with the act of
[SHK] sport there should be again to inflame it and to
[SHK] give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour
[SHK] sympathy in years manners and beauties all which
[SHK] the Moor is defective in now for want of these
[SHK] required conveniences her delicate tenderness will
[SHK] find itself abused begin to heave the gorge
[SHK] disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will
[SHK] instruct her in it and compel her to some second
[SHK] choice Now sir this granted -- as it is a most
[SHK] pregnant and unforced position -- who stands so
[SHK] eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
[SHK] does a knave very voluble no further
[SHK] conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
[SHK] civil and humane seeming for the better compassing
[SHK] of his salt and most hidden loose affection why
[SHK] none why none a slipper and subtle knave a
[SHK] finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
[SHK] counterfeit advantages though true advantage never
[SHK] present itself a devilish knave Besides the
[SHK] knave is handsome young and hath all those
[SHK] requisites in him that folly and green minds look
[SHK] after a pestilent complete knave and the woman
[SHK] hath found him already
[SHK] I can not believe that in her she 's full of
[SHK] most blessed condition
[SHK] Blessed fig's-end the wine she drinks is made of
[SHK] grapes if she had been blessed she would never
[SHK] have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou
[SHK] not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst
[SHK] not mark that
[SHK] Yes that I did but that was but courtesy
[SHK] Lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue
[SHK] to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met
[SHK] so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
[SHK] together Villanous thoughts Roderigo when these
[SHK] mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes
[SHK] the master and main exercise the incorporate
[SHK] conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I
[SHK] have brought you from Venice Watch you to-night
[SHK] for the command I 'll lay't upon you Cassio knows
[SHK] you not I 'll not be far from you do you find
[SHK] some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking
[SHK] too loud or tainting his discipline or from what
[SHK] other course you please which the time shall more
[SHK] favourably minister
[SHK] Well
[SHK] Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply
[SHK] may strike at you provoke him that he may for
[SHK] even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
[SHK] mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true
[SHK] taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So
[SHK] shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
[SHK] the means I shall then have to prefer them and the
[SHK] impediment most profitably removed without the
[SHK] which there were no expectation of our prosperity
[SHK] I will do this if I can bring it to any
[SHK] opportunity
[SHK] I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel
[SHK] I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell
[SHK] Adieu
[SHK] That Cassio loves her I do well believe it
[SHK] That she loves him 't is apt and of great credit
[SHK] The Moor howbeit that I endure him not
[SHK] Is of a constant loving noble nature
[SHK] And I dare think he 'll prove to Desdemona
[SHK] A most dear husband Now I do love her too
[SHK] Not out of absolute lust though peradventure
[SHK] I stand accountant for as great a sin
[SHK] But partly led to diet my revenge
[SHK] For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
[SHK] Hath leap 'd into my seat the thought whereof
[SHK] Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
[SHK] And nothing can or shall content my soul
[SHK] Till I am even 'd with him wife for wife
[SHK] Or failing so yet that I put the Moor
[SHK] At least into a jealousy so strong
[SHK] That judgment can not cure Which thing to do
[SHK] If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash
[SHK] For his quick hunting stand the putting on
[SHK] I 'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip
[SHK] Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb --
[SHK] For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too --
[SHK] Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me
[SHK] For making him egregiously an ass
[SHK] And practising upon his peace and quiet
[SHK] Even to madness 'T is here but yet confused
[SHK] Knavery 's plain face is never seen tin used
[SHK] It is Othello 's pleasure our noble and valiant
[SHK] general that upon certain tidings now arrived
[SHK] importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet
[SHK] every man put himself into triumph some to dance
[SHK] some to make bonfires each man to what sport and
[SHK] revels his addiction leads him for besides these
[SHK] beneficial news it is the celebration of his
[SHK] nuptial So much was his pleasure should be
[SHK] proclaimed All offices are open and there is full
[SHK] liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
[SHK] till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the
[SHK] isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
[SHK] Good Michael look you to the guard to-night
[SHK] Let 's teach ourselves that honourable stop
[SHK] Not to outsport discretion
[SHK] Iago hath direction what to do
[SHK] But notwithstanding with my personal eye
[SHK] Will I look to't
[SHK] Iago is most honest
[SHK] Michael good night to-morrow with your earliest
[SHK] Let me have speech with you
[SHK] Come my dear love
[SHK] The purchase made the fruits are to ensue
[SHK] That profit 's yet to come 'tween me and you
[SHK] Good night
[SHK] Welcome Iago we must to the watch
[SHK] Not this hour lieutenant 't is not yet ten o the
[SHK] clock Our general cast us thus early for the love
[SHK] of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame
[SHK] he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and
[SHK] she is sport for Jove
[SHK] She 's a most exquisite lady
[SHK] And I 'll warrant her fun of game
[SHK] Indeed she 's a most fresh and delicate creature
[SHK] What an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of
[SHK] provocation
[SHK] An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
[SHK] And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
[SHK] She is indeed perfection
[SHK] Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I
[SHK] have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace
[SHK] of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
[SHK] the health of black Othello
[SHK] Not to-night good Iago I have very poor and
[SHK] unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish
[SHK] courtesy would invent some other custom of
[SHK] entertainment
[SHK] O they are our friends but one cup I 'll drink for
[SHK] you
[SHK] I have drunk but one cup to-night and that was
[SHK] craftily qualified too and behold what innovation
[SHK] it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity
[SHK] and dare not task my weakness with any more
[SHK] What man 't is a night of revels the gallants
[SHK] desire it
[SHK] Where are they
[SHK] Here at the door I pray you call them in
[SHK] I 'll do't but it dislikes me
[SHK] If I can fasten but one cup upon him
[SHK] With that which he hath drunk to-night already
[SHK] He 'll be as full of quarrel and offence
[SHK] As my young mistress dog Now my sick fool Roderigo
[SHK] Whom love hath turn 'd almost the wrong side out
[SHK] To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
[SHK] Potations pottle-deep and he 's to watch
[SHK] Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits
[SHK] That hold their honours in a wary distance
[SHK] The very elements of this warlike isle
[SHK] Have I to-night fluster 'd with flowing cups
[SHK] And they watch too Now 'mongst this flock of drunkards
[SHK] Am I to put our Cassio in some action
[SHK] That may offend the isle. -- But here they come
[SHK] If consequence do but approve my dream
[SHK] My boat sails freely both with wind and stream
[SHK] 'Fore God they have given me a rouse already
[SHK] Good faith a little one not past a pint as I am
[SHK] a soldier
[SHK] Some wine ho
[SHK] And let me the canakin clink clink
[SHK] And let me the canakin clink
[SHK] A soldier 's a man
[SHK] A life 's but a span
[SHK] Why then let a soldier drink
[SHK] Some wine boys
[SHK] 'Fore God an excellent song
[SHK] I learned it in England where indeed they are
[SHK] most potent in potting your Dane your German and
[SHK] your swag-bellied Hollander -- Drink ho -- are nothing
[SHK] to your English
[SHK] Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking
[SHK] Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead
[SHK] drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain he
[SHK] gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle
[SHK] can be filled
[SHK] To the health of our general
[SHK] I am for it lieutenant and I 'll do you justice
[SHK] O sweet England
[SHK] King Stephen was a worthy peer
[SHK] His breeches cost him but a crown
[SHK] He held them sixpence all too dear
[SHK] With that he call 'd the tailor lown
[SHK] He was a wight of high renown
[SHK] And thou art but of low degree
[SHK] 'T is pride that pulls the country down
[SHK] Then take thine auld cloak about thee
[SHK] Some wine ho
[SHK] Why this is a more exquisite song than the other
[SHK] Will you hear't again
[SHK] No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
[SHK] does those things Well God 's above all and there
[SHK] be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
[SHK] It 's true good lieutenant
[SHK] For mine own part -- no offence to the general nor
[SHK] any man of quality -- I hope to be saved
[SHK] And so do I too lieutenant
[SHK] Ay but by your leave not before me the
[SHK] lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient Let 's
[SHK] have no more of this let 's to our affairs. -- Forgive
[SHK] us our sins -- Gentlemen let 's look to our business
[SHK] Do not think gentlemen I am drunk this is my
[SHK] ancient this is my right hand and this is my left
[SHK] I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and
[SHK] speak well enough
[SHK] Excellent well
[SHK] Why very well then you must not think then that I am drunk
[SHK] To the platform masters come let 's set the watch
[SHK] You see this fellow that is gone before
[SHK] He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
[SHK] And give direction and do but see his vice
[SHK] 'T is to his virtue a just equinox
[SHK] The one as long as the other 't is pity of him
[SHK] I fear the trust Othello puts him in
[SHK] On some odd time of his infirmity
[SHK] Will shake this island
[SHK] But is he often thus
[SHK] 'T is evermore the prologue to his sleep
[SHK] He 'll watch the horologe a double set
[SHK] If drink rock not his cradle
[SHK] It were well
[SHK] The general were put in mind of it
[SHK] Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
[SHK] Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
[SHK] And looks not on his evils is not this true
[SHK] I pray you after the lieutenant go
[SHK] And 't is great pity that the noble Moor
[SHK] Should hazard such a place as his own second
[SHK] With one of an ingraft infirmity
[SHK] It were an honest action to say
[SHK] So to the Moor
[SHK] Not I for this fair island
[SHK] I do love Cassio well and would do much
[SHK] To cure him of this evil -- But hark what noise
[SHK] You rogue you rascal
[SHK] What 's the matter lieutenant
[SHK] A knave teach me my duty
[SHK] I 'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle
[SHK] Beat me
[SHK] Dost thou prate rogue
[SHK] Nay good lieutenant
[SHK] I pray you sir hold your hand
[SHK] Let me go sir
[SHK] Or I 'll knock you o'er the mazzard
[SHK] Come come
[SHK] you 're drunk
[SHK] Drunk
[SHK] Nay good lieutenant -- alas gentlemen --
[SHK] Help ho -- Lieutenant -- sir -- Montano -- sir
[SHK] Help masters -- Here 's a goodly watch indeed
[SHK] Who 's that which rings the bell -- Diablo ho
[SHK] The town will rise God 's will lieutenant hold
[SHK] You will be shamed for ever
[SHK] What is the matter here
[SHK] 'Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death
[SHK] Hold for your lives
[SHK] Hold ho Lieutenant -- sir -- Montano -- gentlemen --
[SHK] Have you forgot all sense of place and duty
[SHK] Hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame
[SHK] Why how now ho from whence ariseth this
[SHK] Are we turn 'd Turks and to ourselves do that
[SHK] Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites
[SHK] For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
[SHK] He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
[SHK] Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
[SHK] Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
[SHK] From her propriety What is the matter masters
[SHK] Honest Iago that look'st dead with grieving
[SHK] Speak who began this on thy love I charge thee
[SHK] I do not know friends all but now even now
[SHK] In quarter and in terms like bride and groom
[SHK] Devesting them for bed and then but now --
[SHK] As if some planet had unwitted men --
[SHK] Swords out and tilting one at other 's breast
[SHK] In opposition bloody I can not speak
[SHK] Any beginning to this peevish odds
[SHK] And would in action glorious I had lost
[SHK] Those legs that brought me to a part of it
[SHK] How comes it Michael you are thus forgot
[SHK] I pray you pardon me I can not speak
[SHK] Worthy Montano you were wont be civil
[SHK] The gravity and stillness of your youth
[SHK] The world hath noted and your name is great
[SHK] In mouths of wisest censure what 's the matter
[SHK] That you unlace your reputation thus
[SHK] And spend your rich opinion for the name
[SHK] Of a night-brawler give me answer to it
[SHK] Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
[SHK] Your officer Iago can inform you --
[SHK] While I spare speech which something now
[SHK] offends me --
[SHK] Of all that I do know nor know I aught
[SHK] By me that 's said or done amiss this night
[SHK] Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice
[SHK] And to defend ourselves it be a sin
[SHK] When violence assails us
[SHK] Now by heaven
[SHK] My blood begins my safer guides to rule
[SHK] And passion having my best judgment collied
[SHK] Assays to lead the way if I once stir
[SHK] Or do but lift this arm the best of you
[SHK] Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know
[SHK] How this foul rout began who set it on
[SHK] And he that is approved in this offence
[SHK] Though he had twinn 'd with me both at a birth
[SHK] Shall lose me What in a town of war
[SHK] Yet wild the people 's hearts brimful of fear
[SHK] To manage private and domestic quarrel
[SHK] In night and on the court and guard of safety
[SHK] 'T is monstrous Iago who bega n't
[SHK] If partially affined or leagued in office
[SHK] Thou dost deliver more or less than truth
[SHK] Thou art no soldier
[SHK] Touch me not so near
[SHK] I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
[SHK] Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio
[SHK] Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth
[SHK] Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general
[SHK] Montano and myself being in speech
[SHK] There comes a fellow crying out for help
[SHK] And Cassio following him with determined sword
[SHK] To execute upon him Sir this gentleman
[SHK] Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause
[SHK] Myself the crying fellow did pursue
[SHK] Lest by his clamour -- as it so fell out --
[SHK] The town might fall in fright he swift of foot
[SHK] Outran my purpose and I return 'd the rather
[SHK] For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
[SHK] And Cassio high in oath which till to-night
[SHK] I ne'er might say before When I came back --
[SHK] For this was brief -- I found them close together
[SHK] At blow and thrust even as again they were
[SHK] When you yourself did part them
[SHK] More of this matter can not I report
[SHK] But men are men the best sometimes forget
[SHK] Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
[SHK] As men in rage strike those that wish them best
[SHK] Yet surely Cassio I believe received
[SHK] From him that fled some strange indignity
[SHK] Which patience could not pass
[SHK] I know Iago
[SHK] Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
[SHK] Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee
[SHK] But never more be officer of mine
[SHK] Look if my gentle love be not raised up
[SHK] I 'll make thee an example
[SHK] What 's the matter
[SHK] All 's well now sweeting come away to bed
[SHK] Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
[SHK] Lead him off
[SHK] Iago look with care about the town
[SHK] And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
[SHK] Come Desdemona 't is the soldiers life
[SHK] To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
[SHK] What are you hurt lieutenant
[SHK] Ay past all surgery
[SHK] Marry heaven forbid
[SHK] Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost
[SHK] my reputation I have lost the immortal part of
[SHK] myself and what remains is bestial My reputation
[SHK] Iago my reputation
[SHK] As I am an honest man I thought you had received
[SHK] some bodily wound there is more sense in that than
[SHK] in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false
[SHK] imposition oft got without merit and lost without
[SHK] deserving you have lost no reputation at all
[SHK] unless you repute yourself such a loser What man
[SHK] there are ways to recover the general again you
[SHK] are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in
[SHK] policy than in malice even so as one would beat his
[SHK] offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue
[SHK] to him again and he 's yours
[SHK] I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
[SHK] good a commander with so slight so drunken and so
[SHK] indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot
[SHK] and squabble swagger swear and discourse
[SHK] fustian with one 's own shadow O thou invisible
[SHK] spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by
[SHK] let us call thee devil
[SHK] What was he that you followed with your sword What
[SHK] had he done to you
[SHK] I know not
[SHK] Is't possible
[SHK] I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly
[SHK] a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men
[SHK] should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
[SHK] their brains that we should with joy pleasance
[SHK] revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
[SHK] Why but you are now well enough how came you thus
[SHK] recovered
[SHK] It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
[SHK] to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me
[SHK] another to make me frankly despise myself
[SHK] Come you are too severe a moraler as the time
[SHK] the place and the condition of this country
[SHK] stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen
[SHK] but since it is as it is mend it for your own good
[SHK] I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me
[SHK] I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra
[SHK] such an answer would stop them all To be now a
[SHK] sensible man by and by a fool and presently a
[SHK] beast O strange Every inordinate cup is
[SHK] unblessed and the ingredient is a devil
[SHK] Come come good wine is a good familiar creature
[SHK] if it be well used exclaim no more against it
[SHK] And good lieutenant I think you think I love you
[SHK] I have well approved it sir I drunk
[SHK] You or any man living may be drunk at a time man
[SHK] I 'll tell you what you shall do Our general 's wife
[SHK] is now the general may say so in this respect for
[SHK] that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
[SHK] contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and
[SHK] graces confess yourself freely to her importune
[SHK] her help to put you in your place again she is of
[SHK] so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition
[SHK] she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
[SHK] than she is requested this broken joint between
[SHK] you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my
[SHK] fortunes against any lay worth naming this
[SHK] crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
[SHK] You advise me well
[SHK] I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
[SHK] I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will
[SHK] beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me
[SHK] I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here
[SHK] You are in the right Good night lieutenant I
[SHK] must to the watch
[SHK] Good night honest Iago
[SHK] And what 's he then that says I play the villain
[SHK] When this advice is free I give and honest
[SHK] Probal to thinking and indeed the course
[SHK] To win the Moor again For 't is most easy
[SHK] The inclining Desdemona to subdue
[SHK] In any honest suit she 's framed as fruitful
[SHK] As the free elements And then for her
[SHK] To win the Moor -- were't to renounce his baptism
[SHK] All seals and symbols of redeemed sin
[SHK] His soul is so enfetter 'd to her love
[SHK] That she may make unmake do what she list
[SHK] Even as her appetite shall play the god
[SHK] With his weak function How am I then a villain
[SHK] To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
[SHK] Directly to his good Divinity of hell
[SHK] When devils will the blackest sins put on
[SHK] They do suggest at first with heavenly shows
[SHK] As I do now for whiles this honest fool
[SHK] Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
[SHK] And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
[SHK] I 'll pour this pestilence into his ear
[SHK] That she repeals him for her body 's lust
[SHK] And by how much she strives to do him good
[SHK] She shall undo her credit with the Moor
[SHK] So will I turn her virtue into pitch
[SHK] And out of her own goodness make the net
[SHK] That shall enmesh them all
[SHK] How now Roderigo
[SHK] I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that
[SHK] hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is
[SHK] almost spent I have been to-night exceedingly well
[SHK] cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall
[SHK] have so much experience for my pains and so with
[SHK] no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice
[SHK] How poor are they that have not patience
[SHK] What wound did ever heal but by degrees
[SHK] Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft
[SHK] And wit depends on dilatory time
[SHK] Does't not go well Cassio hath beaten thee
[SHK] And thou by that small hurt hast cashier 'd Cassio
[SHK] Though other things grow fair against the sun
[SHK] Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
[SHK] Content thyself awhile By the mass 't is morning
[SHK] Pleasure and action make the hours seem short
[SHK] Retire thee go where thou art billeted
[SHK] Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter
[SHK] Nay get thee gone
[SHK] Two things are to be done
[SHK] My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress
[SHK] I 'll set her on
[SHK] Myself the while to draw the Moor apart
[SHK] And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
[SHK] Soliciting his wife ay that 's the way
[SHK] Dull not device by coldness and delay
[SHK] Masters play here I will content your pains
[SHK] Something that 's brief and bid 'Good morrow general
[SHK] Why masters have your instruments been in Naples
[SHK] that they speak i the nose thus
[SHK] How sir how
[SHK] Are these I pray you wind-instruments
[SHK] Ay marry are they sir
[SHK] O thereby hangs a tail
[SHK] Whereby hangs a tale sir
[SHK] Marry sir by many a wind-instrument that I know
[SHK] But masters here 's money for you and the general
[SHK] so likes your music that he desires you for love 's
[SHK] sake to make no more noise with it
[SHK] Well sir we will not
[SHK] If you have any music that may not be heard to't
[SHK] again but as they say to hear music the general
[SHK] does not greatly care
[SHK] We have none such sir
[SHK] Then put up your pipes in your bag for I 'll away
[SHK] go vanish into air away
[SHK] Dost thou hear my honest friend
[SHK] No I hear not your honest friend I hear you
[SHK] Prithee keep up thy quillets There 's a poor piece
[SHK] of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends
[SHK] the general 's wife be stirring tell her there 's
[SHK] one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech
[SHK] wilt thou do this
[SHK] She is stirring sir if she will stir hither I
[SHK] shall seem to notify unto her
[SHK] Do good my friend
[SHK] In happy time Iago
[SHK] You have not been a-bed then
[SHK] Why no the day had broke
[SHK] Before we parted I have made bold Iago
[SHK] To send in to your wife my suit to her
[SHK] Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona
[SHK] Procure me some access
[SHK] I 'll send her to you presently
[SHK] And I 'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
[SHK] Out of the way that your converse and business
[SHK] May be more free
[SHK] I humbly thank you for't
[SHK] I never knew
[SHK] A Florentine more kind and honest
[SHK] Good morrow good Lieutenant I am sorry
[SHK] For your displeasure but all will sure be well
[SHK] The general and his wife are talking of it
[SHK] And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies
[SHK] That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
[SHK] And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
[SHK] He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
[SHK] And needs no other suitor but his likings
[SHK] To take the safest occasion by the front
[SHK] To bring you in again
[SHK] Yet I beseech you
[SHK] If you think fit or that it may be done
[SHK] Give me advantage of some brief discourse
[SHK] With Desdemona alone
[SHK] Pray you come in
[SHK] I will bestow you where you shall have time
[SHK] To speak your bosom freely
[SHK] I am much bound to you
[SHK] These letters give Iago to the pilot
[SHK] And by him do my duties to the senate
[SHK] That done I will be walking on the works
[SHK] Repair there to me
[SHK] Well my good lord I 'll do't
[SHK] This fortification gentlemen shall we see't
[SHK] We 'll wait upon your lordship
[SHK] Be thou assured good Cassio I will do
[SHK] All my abilities in thy behalf
[SHK] Good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband
[SHK] As if the case were his
[SHK] O that 's an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio
[SHK] But I will have my lord and you again
[SHK] As friendly as you were
[SHK] Bounteous madam
[SHK] Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio
[SHK] He 's never any thing but your true servant
[SHK] I know't I thank you You do love my lord
[SHK] You have known him long and be you well assured
[SHK] He shall in strangeness stand no further off
[SHK] Than in a polite distance
[SHK] Ay but lady
[SHK] That policy may either last so long
[SHK] Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
[SHK] Or breed itself so out of circumstance
[SHK] That I being absent and my place supplied
[SHK] My general will forget my love and service
[SHK] Do not doubt that before Emilia here
[SHK] I give thee warrant of thy place assure thee
[SHK] If I do vow a friendship I 'll perform it
[SHK] To the last article my lord shall never rest
[SHK] I 'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience
[SHK] His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
[SHK] I 'll intermingle every thing he does
[SHK] With Cassio 's suit therefore be merry Cassio
[SHK] For thy solicitor shall rather die
[SHK] Than give thy cause away
[SHK] Madam here comes my lord
[SHK] Madam I 'll take my leave
[SHK] Why stay and hear me speak
[SHK] Madam not now I am very ill at ease
[SHK] Unfit for mine own purposes
[SHK] Well do your discretion
[SHK] Ha I like not that
[SHK] What dost thou say
[SHK] Nothing my lord or if -- I know not what
[SHK] Was not that Cassio parted from my wife
[SHK] Cassio my lord No sure I can not think it
[SHK] That he would steal away so guilty-like
[SHK] Seeing you coming
[SHK] I do believe 't was he
[SHK] How now my lord
[SHK] I have been talking with a suitor here
[SHK] A man that languishes in your displeasure
[SHK] Who is't you mean
[SHK] Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord
[SHK] If I have any grace or power to move you
[SHK] His present reconciliation take
[SHK] For if he be not one that truly loves you
[SHK] That errs in ignorance and not in cunning
[SHK] I have no judgment in an honest face
[SHK] I prithee call him back
[SHK] Went he hence now
[SHK] Ay sooth so humbled
[SHK] That he hath left part of his grief with me
[SHK] To suffer with him Good love call him back
[SHK] Not now sweet Desdemona some other time
[SHK] But shall't be shortly
[SHK] The sooner sweet for you
[SHK] Shall't be to-night at supper
[SHK] No not to-night
[SHK] To-morrow dinner then
[SHK] I shall not dine at home
[SHK] I meet the captains at the citadel
[SHK] Why then to-morrow night or Tuesday morn
[SHK] On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn
[SHK] I prithee name the time but let it not
[SHK] Exceed three days in faith he 's penitent
[SHK] And yet his trespass in our common reason --
[SHK] Save that they say the wars must make examples
[SHK] Out of their best -- is not almost a fault
[SHK] To incur a private cheque When shall he come
[SHK] Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul
[SHK] What you would ask me that I should deny
[SHK] Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio
[SHK] That came a-wooing with you and so many a time
[SHK] When I have spoke of you dispraisingly
[SHK] Hath ta'en your part to have so much to do
[SHK] To bring him in Trust me I could do much --
[SHK] Prithee no more let him come when he will
[SHK] I will deny thee nothing
[SHK] Why this is not a boon
[SHK] 'T is as I should entreat you wear your gloves
[SHK] Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
[SHK] Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
[SHK] To your own person nay when I have a suit
[SHK] Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed
[SHK] It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
[SHK] And fearful to be granted
[SHK] I will deny thee nothing
[SHK] Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
[SHK] To leave me but a little to myself
[SHK] Shall I deny you no farewell my lord
[SHK] Farewell my Desdemona I 'll come to thee straight
[SHK] Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you
[SHK] Whate'er you be I am obedient
[SHK] Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul
[SHK] But I do love thee and when I love thee not
[SHK] Chaos is come again
[SHK] My noble lord --
[SHK] What dost thou say Iago
[SHK] Did Michael Cassio when you woo 'd my lady
[SHK] Know of your love
[SHK] He did from first to last why dost thou ask
[SHK] But for a satisfaction of my thought
[SHK] No further harm
[SHK] Why of thy thought Iago
[SHK] I did not think he had been acquainted with her
[SHK] O yes and went between us very oft
[SHK] Indeed
[SHK] Indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that
[SHK] Is he not honest
[SHK] Honest my lord
[SHK] Honest ay honest
[SHK] My lord for aught I know
[SHK] What dost thou think
[SHK] Think my lord
[SHK] Think my lord
[SHK] By heaven he echoes me
[SHK] As if there were some monster in his thought
[SHK] Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something
[SHK] I heard thee say even now thou likedst not that
[SHK] When Cassio left my wife what didst not like
[SHK] And when I told thee he was of my counsel
[SHK] In my whole course of wooing thou criedst 'Indeed
[SHK] And didst contract and purse thy brow together
[SHK] As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
[SHK] Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me
[SHK] Show me thy thought
[SHK] My lord you know I love you
[SHK] I think thou dost
[SHK] And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty
[SHK] And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath
[SHK] Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
[SHK] For such things in a false disloyal knave
[SHK] Are tricks of custom but in a man that 's just
[SHK] They are close delations working from the heart
[SHK] That passion can not rule
[SHK] For Michael Cassio
[SHK] I dare be sworn I think that he is honest
[SHK] I think so too
[SHK] Men should be what they seem
[SHK] Or those that be not would they might seem none
[SHK] Certain men should be what they seem
[SHK] Why then I think Cassio 's an honest man
[SHK] Nay yet there 's more in this
[SHK] I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
[SHK] As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
[SHK] The worst of words
[SHK] Good my lord pardon me
[SHK] Though I am bound to every act of duty
[SHK] I am not bound to that all slaves are free to
[SHK] Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false
[SHK] As where 's that palace whereinto foul things
[SHK] Sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure
[SHK] But some uncleanly apprehensions
[SHK] Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
[SHK] With meditations lawful
[SHK] Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago
[SHK] If thou but think'st him wrong 'd and makest his ear
[SHK] A stranger to thy thoughts
[SHK] I do beseech you --
[SHK] Though I perchance am vicious in my guess
[SHK] As I confess it is my nature 's plague
[SHK] To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
[SHK] Shapes faults that are not -- that your wisdom yet
[SHK] From one that so imperfectly conceits
[SHK] Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
[SHK] Out of his scattering and unsure observance
[SHK] It were not for your quiet nor your good
[SHK] Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
[SHK] To let you know my thoughts
[SHK] What dost thou mean
[SHK] Good name in man and woman dear my lord
[SHK] Is the immediate jewel of their souls
[SHK] Who steals my purse steals trash 't is something nothing
[SHK] 'T was mine 't is his and has been slave to thousands
[SHK] But he that filches from me my good name
[SHK] Robs me of that which not enriches him
[SHK] And makes me poor indeed
[SHK] By heaven I 'll know thy thoughts
[SHK] You can not if my heart were in your hand
[SHK] Nor shall not whilst 't is in my custody
[SHK] Ha
[SHK] O beware my lord of jealousy
[SHK] It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
[SHK] The meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss
[SHK] Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
[SHK] But O what damned minutes tells he o'er
[SHK] Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
[SHK] O misery
[SHK] Poor and content is rich and rich enough
[SHK] But riches fineless is as poor as winter
[SHK] To him that ever fears he shall be poor
[SHK] Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
[SHK] From jealousy
[SHK] Why why is this
[SHK] Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy
[SHK] To follow still the changes of the moon
[SHK] With fresh suspicions No to be once in doubt
[SHK] Is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat
[SHK] When I shall turn the business of my soul
[SHK] To such exsufflicate and blown surmises
[SHK] Matching thy inference 'T is not to make me jealous
[SHK] To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
[SHK] Is free of speech sings plays and dances well
[SHK] Where virtue is these are more virtuous
[SHK] Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
[SHK] The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
[SHK] For she had eyes and chose me No Iago
[SHK] I 'll see before I doubt when I doubt prove
[SHK] And on the proof there is no more but this --
[SHK] Away at once with love or jealousy
[SHK] I am glad of it for now I shall have reason
[SHK] To show the love and duty that I bear you
[SHK] With franker spirit therefore as I am bound
[SHK] Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof
[SHK] Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio
[SHK] Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
[SHK] I would not have your free and noble nature
[SHK] Out of self-bounty be abused look to't
[SHK] I know our country disposition well
[SHK] In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
[SHK] They dare not show their husbands their best conscience
[SHK] Is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown
[SHK] Dost thou say so
[SHK] She did deceive her father marrying you
[SHK] And when she seem 'd to shake and fear your looks
[SHK] She loved them most
[SHK] And so she did
[SHK] Why go to then
[SHK] She that so young could give out such a seeming
[SHK] To seal her father 's eyes up close as oak-
[SHK] He thought 't was witchcraft -- but I am much to blame
[SHK] I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
[SHK] For too much loving you
[SHK] I am bound to thee for ever
[SHK] I see this hath a little dash 'd your spirits
[SHK] Not a jot not a jot
[SHK] I faith I fear it has
[SHK] I hope you will consider what is spoke
[SHK] Comes from my love But I do see you 're moved
[SHK] I am to pray you not to strain my speech
[SHK] To grosser issues nor to larger reach
[SHK] Than to suspicion
[SHK] I will not
[SHK] Should you do so my lord
[SHK] My speech should fall into such vile success
[SHK] As my thoughts aim not at Cassio 's my worthy friend --
[SHK] My lord I see you 're moved
[SHK] No not much moved
[SHK] I do not think but Desdemona 's honest
[SHK] Long live she so and long live you to think so
[SHK] And yet how nature erring from itself --
[SHK] Ay there 's the point as -- to be bold with you --
[SHK] Not to affect many proposed matches
[SHK] Of her own clime complexion and degree
[SHK] Whereto we see in all things nature tends --
[SHK] Foh one may smell in such a will most rank
[SHK] Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
[SHK] But pardon me I do not in position
[SHK] Distinctly speak of her though I may fear
[SHK] Her will recoiling to her better judgment
[SHK] May fall to match you with her country forms
[SHK] And happily repent
[SHK] Farewell farewell
[SHK] If more thou dost perceive let me know more
[SHK] Set on thy wife to observe leave me Iago
[SHK] Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless
[SHK] Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
[SHK] your honour
[SHK] To scan this thing no further leave it to time
[SHK] Though it be fit that Cassio have his place
[SHK] For sure he fills it up with great ability
[SHK] Yet if you please to hold him off awhile
[SHK] You shall by that perceive him and his means
[SHK] Note if your lady strain his entertainment
[SHK] With any strong or vehement importunity
[SHK] Much will be seen in that In the mean time
[SHK] Let me be thought too busy in my fears --
[SHK] As worthy cause I have to fear I am --
[SHK] And hold her free I do beseech your honour
[SHK] Fear not my government
[SHK] I once more take my leave
[SHK] This fellow 's of exceeding honesty
[SHK] And knows all qualities with a learned spirit
[SHK] Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard
[SHK] Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
[SHK] I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
[SHK] To pray at fortune Haply for I am black
[SHK] And have not those soft parts of conversation
[SHK] That chamberers have or for I am declined
[SHK] Into the vale of years -- yet that 's not much --
[SHK] She 's gone I am abused and my relief
[SHK] Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage
[SHK] That we can call these delicate creatures ours
[SHK] And not their appetites I had rather be a toad
[SHK] And live upon the vapour of a dungeon
[SHK] Than keep a corner in the thing I love
[SHK] For others uses Yet 't is the plague of great ones
[SHK] Prerogatived are they less than the base
[SHK] 'T is destiny unshunnable like death
[SHK] Even then this forked plague is fated to us
[SHK] When we do quicken Desdemona comes
[SHK] If she be false O then heaven mocks itself
[SHK] I 'll not believe't
[SHK] How now my dear Othello
[SHK] Your dinner and the generous islanders
[SHK] By you invited do attend your presence
[SHK] I am to blame
[SHK] Why do you speak so faintly
[SHK] Are you not well
[SHK] I have a pain upon my forehead here
[SHK] 'Faith that 's with watching 'twill away again
[SHK] Let me but bind it hard within this hour
[SHK] It will be well
[SHK] Your napkin is too little
[SHK] Let it alone Come I 'll go in with you
[SHK] I am very sorry that you are not well
[SHK] I am glad I have found this napkin
[SHK] This was her first remembrance from the Moor
[SHK] My wayward husband hath a hundred times
[SHK] Woo 'd me to steal it but she so loves the token
[SHK] For he conjured her she should ever keep it
[SHK] That she reserves it evermore about her
[SHK] To kiss and talk to I 'll have the work ta'en out
[SHK] And give't Iago what he will do with it
[SHK] Heaven knows not I
[SHK] I nothing but to please his fantasy
[SHK] How now what do you here alone
[SHK] Do not you chide I have a thing for you
[SHK] A thing for me it is a common thing --
[SHK] Ha
[SHK] To have a foolish wife
[SHK] O is that all What will you give me now
[SHK] For the same handkerchief
[SHK] What handkerchief
[SHK] What handkerchief
[SHK] Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona
[SHK] That which so often you did bid me steal
[SHK] Hast stol'n it from her
[SHK] No 'faith she let it drop by negligence
[SHK] And to the advantage I being here took't up
[SHK] Look here it is
[SHK] A good wench give it me
[SHK] What will you do with 't that you have been
[SHK] so earnest
[SHK] To have me filch it
[SHK] If it be not for some purpose of import
[SHK] Give't me again poor lady she 'll run mad
[SHK] When she shall lack it
[SHK] Be not acknown on 't I have use for it
[SHK] Go leave me
[SHK] I will in Cassio 's lodging lose this napkin
[SHK] And let him find it Trifles light as air
[SHK] Are to the jealous confirmations strong
[SHK] As proofs of holy writ this may do something
[SHK] The Moor already changes with my poison
[SHK] Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
[SHK] Which at the first are scarce found to distaste
[SHK] But with a little act upon the blood
[SHK] Burn like the mines of Sulphur I did say so
[SHK] Look where he comes
[SHK] Not poppy nor mandragora
[SHK] Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
[SHK] Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
[SHK] Which thou owedst yesterday
[SHK] Ha ha false to me
[SHK] Why how now general no more of that
[SHK] Avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack
[SHK] I swear 't is better to be much abused
[SHK] Than but to know't a little
[SHK] How now my lord
[SHK] What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust
[SHK] I saw't not thought it not it harm 'd not me
[SHK] I slept the next night well was free and merry
[SHK] I found not Cassio 's kisses on her lips
[SHK] He that is robb 'd not wanting what is stol'n
[SHK] Let him not know't and he 's not robb 'd at all
[SHK] I am sorry to hear this
[SHK] I had been happy if the general camp
[SHK] Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
[SHK] So I had nothing known O now for ever
[SHK] Farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
[SHK] Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
[SHK] That make ambition virtue O farewell
[SHK] Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
[SHK] The spirit-stirring drum the ear-piercing fife
[SHK] The royal banner and all quality
[SHK] Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
[SHK] And O you mortal engines whose rude throats
[SHK] The immortal Jove 's dead clamours counterfeit
[SHK] Farewell Othello 's occupation 's gone
[SHK] Is't possible my lord
[SHK] Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
[SHK] Be sure of it give me the ocular proof
[SHK] Or by the worth of man 's eternal soul
[SHK] Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
[SHK] Than answer my waked wrath
[SHK] Is't come to this
[SHK] Make me to see't or at the least so prove it
[SHK] That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
[SHK] To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
[SHK] My noble lord --
[SHK] If thou dost slander her and torture me
[SHK] Never pray more abandon all remorse
[SHK] On horror 's head horrors accumulate
[SHK] Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed
[SHK] For nothing canst thou to damnation add
[SHK] Greater than that
[SHK] O grace O heaven forgive me
[SHK] Are you a man have you a soul or sense
[SHK] God be wi you take mine office O wretched fool
[SHK] That livest to make thine honesty a vice
[SHK] O monstrous world Take note take note O world
[SHK] To be direct and honest is not safe
[SHK] I thank you for this profit and from hence
[SHK] I 'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence
[SHK] Nay stay thou shouldst be honest
[SHK] I should be wise for honesty 's a fool
[SHK] And loses that it works for
[SHK] By the world
[SHK] I think my wife be honest and think she is not
[SHK] I think that thou art just and think thou art not
[SHK] I 'll have some proof Her name that was as fresh
[SHK] As Dian 's visage is now begrimed and black
[SHK] As mine own face If there be cords or knives
[SHK] Poison or fire or suffocating streams
[SHK] I 'll not endure it Would I were satisfied
[SHK] I see sir you are eaten up with passion
[SHK] I do repent me that I put it to you
[SHK] You would be satisfied
[SHK] Would nay I will
[SHK] And may but how how satisfied my lord
[SHK] Would you the supervisor grossly gape on --
[SHK] Behold her topp 'd
[SHK] Death and damnation O
[SHK] It were a tedious difficulty I think
[SHK] To bring them to that prospect damn them then
[SHK] If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
[SHK] More than their own What then how then
[SHK] What shall I say Where 's satisfaction
[SHK] It is impossible you should see this
[SHK] Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
[SHK] As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
[SHK] As ignorance made drunk But yet I say
[SHK] If imputation and strong circumstances
[SHK] Which lead directly to the door of truth
[SHK] Will give you satisfaction you may have't
[SHK] Give me a living reason she 's disloyal
[SHK] I do not like the office
[SHK] But sith I am enter 'd in this cause so far
[SHK] Prick 'd to't by foolish honesty and love
[SHK] I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
[SHK] And being troubled with a raging tooth
[SHK] I could not sleep
[SHK] There are a kind of men so loose of soul
[SHK] That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
[SHK] One of this kind is Cassio
[SHK] In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona
[SHK] Let us be wary let us hide our loves
[SHK] And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
[SHK] Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard
[SHK] As if he pluck 'd up kisses by the roots
[SHK] That grew upon my lips then laid his leg
[SHK] Over my thigh and sigh 'd and kiss 'd and then
[SHK] Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor
[SHK] O monstrous monstrous
[SHK] Nay this was but his dream
[SHK] But this denoted a foregone conclusion
[SHK] 'T is a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
[SHK] And this may help to thicken other proofs
[SHK] That do demonstrate thinly
[SHK] I 'll tear her all to pieces
[SHK] Nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
[SHK] She may be honest yet Tell me but this
[SHK] Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
[SHK] Spotted with strawberries in your wife 's hand
[SHK] I gave her such a one 't was my first gift
[SHK] I know not that but such a handkerchief --
[SHK] I am sure it was your wife 's -- did I to-day
[SHK] See Cassio wipe his beard with
[SHK] If it be that --
[SHK] If it be that or any that was hers
[SHK] It speaks against her with the other proofs
[SHK] O that the slave had forty thousand lives
[SHK] One is too poor too weak for my revenge
[SHK] Now do I see 't is true Look here Iago
[SHK] All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven
[SHK] 'T is gone
[SHK] Arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell
[SHK] Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne
[SHK] To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught
[SHK] For 't is of aspics tongues
[SHK] Yet be content
[SHK] O blood blood blood
[SHK] Patience I say your mind perhaps may change
[SHK] Never Iago Like to the Pontic sea
[SHK] Whose icy current and compulsive course
[SHK] Ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
[SHK] To the Propontic and the Hellespont
[SHK] Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
[SHK] Shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love
[SHK] Till that a capable and wide revenge
[SHK] Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven
[SHK] In the due reverence of a sacred vow
[SHK] I here engage my words
[SHK] Do not rise yet
[SHK] Witness you ever-burning lights above
[SHK] You elements that clip us round about
[SHK] Witness that here Iago doth give up
[SHK] The execution of his wit hands heart
[SHK] To wrong 'd Othello 's service Let him command
[SHK] And to obey shall be in me remorse
[SHK] What bloody business ever
[SHK] I greet thy love
[SHK] Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
[SHK] And will upon the instant put thee to't
[SHK] Within these three days let me hear thee say
[SHK] That Cassio 's not alive
[SHK] My friend is dead 't is done at your request
[SHK] But let her live
[SHK] Damn her lewd minx O damn her
[SHK] Come go with me apart I will withdraw
[SHK] To furnish me with some swift means of death
[SHK] For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant
[SHK] I am your own for ever
[SHK] Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies
[SHK] I dare not say he lies any where
[SHK] Why man
[SHK] He 's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies
[SHK] is stabbing
[SHK] Go to where lodges he
[SHK] To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie
[SHK] Can any thing be made of this
[SHK] I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a
[SHK] lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were
[SHK] to lie in mine own throat
[SHK] Can you inquire him out and be edified by report
[SHK] I will catechise the world for him that is make
[SHK] questions and by them answer
[SHK] Seek him bid him come hither tell him I have
[SHK] moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
[SHK] To do this is within the compass of man 's wit and
[SHK] therefore I will attempt the doing it
[SHK] Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia
[SHK] I know not madam
[SHK] Believe me I had rather have lost my purse
[SHK] Full of crusadoes and but my noble Moor
[SHK] Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
[SHK] As jealous creatures are it were enough
[SHK] To put him to ill thinking
[SHK] Is he not jealous
[SHK] Who he I think the sun where he was born
[SHK] Drew all such humours from him
[SHK] Look where he comes
[SHK] I will not leave him now till Cassio
[SHK] Be call 'd to him
[SHK] How is't with you my lord
[SHK] Well my good lady
[SHK] O hardness to dissemble --
[SHK] How do you Desdemona
[SHK] Well my good lord
[SHK] Give me your hand this hand is moist my lady
[SHK] It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow
[SHK] This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
[SHK] Hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires
[SHK] A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
[SHK] Much castigation exercise devout
[SHK] For here 's a young and sweating devil here
[SHK] That commonly rebels 'T is a good hand
[SHK] A frank one
[SHK] You may indeed say so
[SHK] For 't was that hand that gave away my heart
[SHK] A liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands
[SHK] But our new heraldry is hands not hearts
[SHK] I can not speak of this Come now your promise
[SHK] What promise chuck
[SHK] I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you
[SHK] I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
[SHK] Lend me thy handkerchief
[SHK] Here my lord
[SHK] That which I gave you
[SHK] I have it not about me
[SHK] Not
[SHK] No indeed my lord
[SHK] That is a fault
[SHK] That handkerchief
[SHK] Did an Egyptian to my mother give
[SHK] She was a charmer and could almost read
[SHK] The thoughts of people she told her while
[SHK] she kept it
[SHK] 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
[SHK] Entirely to her love but if she lost it
[SHK] Or made gift of it my father 's eye
[SHK] Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
[SHK] After new fancies she dying gave it me
[SHK] And bid me when my fate would have me wive
[SHK] To give it her I did so and take heed o n't
[SHK] Make it a darling like your precious eye
[SHK] To lose't or give't away were such perdition
[SHK] As nothing else could match
[SHK] Is't possible
[SHK] 'T is true there 's magic in the web of it
[SHK] A sibyl that had number 'd in the world
[SHK] The sun to course two hundred compasses
[SHK] In her prophetic fury sew 'd the work
[SHK] The worms were hallow 'd that did breed the silk
[SHK] And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
[SHK] Conserved of maidens hearts
[SHK] Indeed is't true
[SHK] Most veritable therefore look to't well
[SHK] Then would to God that I had never see n't
[SHK] Ha wherefore
[SHK] Why do you speak so startingly and rash
[SHK] Is't lost is't gone speak is it out
[SHK] o the way
[SHK] Heaven bless us
[SHK] Say you
[SHK] It is not lost but what an if it were
[SHK] How
[SHK] I say it is not lost
[SHK] Fetch't let me see't
[SHK] Why so I can sir but I will not now
[SHK] This is a trick to put me from my suit
[SHK] Pray you let Cassio be received again
[SHK] Fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
[SHK] Come come
[SHK] You 'll never meet a more sufficient man
[SHK] The handkerchief
[SHK] I pray talk me of Cassio
[SHK] The handkerchief
[SHK] A man that all his time
[SHK] Hath founded his good fortunes on your love
[SHK] Shared dangers with you --
[SHK] The handkerchief
[SHK] In sooth you are to blame
[SHK] Away
[SHK] Is not this man jealous
[SHK] I ne'er saw this before
[SHK] Sure there 's some wonder in this handkerchief
[SHK] I am most unhappy in the loss of it
[SHK] 'T is not a year or two shows us a man
[SHK] They are all but stomachs and we all but food
[SHK] To eat us hungerly and when they are full
[SHK] They belch us Look you Cassio and my husband
[SHK] There is no other way 't is she must do't
[SHK] And lo the happiness go and importune her
[SHK] How now good Cassio what 's the news with you
[SHK] Madam my former suit I do beseech you
[SHK] That by your virtuous means I may again
[SHK] Exist and be a member of his love
[SHK] Whom I with all the office of my heart
[SHK] Entirely honour I would not be delay 'd
[SHK] If my offence be of such mortal kind
[SHK] That nor my service past nor present sorrows
[SHK] Nor purposed merit in futurity
[SHK] Can ransom me into his love again
[SHK] But to know so must be my benefit
[SHK] So shall I clothe me in a forced content
[SHK] And shut myself up in some other course
[SHK] To fortune 's alms
[SHK] Alas thrice-gentle Cassio
[SHK] My advocation is not now in tune
[SHK] My lord is not my lord nor should I know him
[SHK] Were he in favour as in humour alter 'd
[SHK] So help me every spirit sanctified
[SHK] As I have spoken for you all my best
[SHK] And stood within the blank of his displeasure
[SHK] For my free speech you must awhile be patient
[SHK] What I can do I will and more I will
[SHK] Than for myself I dare let that suffice you
[SHK] Is my lord angry
[SHK] He went hence but now
[SHK] And certainly in strange unquietness
[SHK] Can he be angry I have seen the cannon
[SHK] When it hath blown his ranks into the air
[SHK] And like the devil from his very arm
[SHK] Puff 'd his own brother -- and can he be angry
[SHK] Something of moment then I will go meet him
[SHK] There 's matter i n't indeed if he be angry
[SHK] I prithee do so
[SHK] Something sure of state
[SHK] Either from Venice or some unhatch 'd practise
[SHK] Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him
[SHK] Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
[SHK] Men 's natures wrangle with inferior things
[SHK] Though great ones are their object 'T is even so
[SHK] For let our finger ache and it indues
[SHK] Our other healthful members even to that sense
[SHK] Of pain nay we must think men are not gods
[SHK] Nor of them look for such observances
[SHK] As fit the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia
[SHK] I was unhandsome warrior as I am
[SHK] Arraigning his unkindness with my soul
[SHK] But now I find I had suborn 'd the witness
[SHK] And he 's indicted falsely
[SHK] Pray heaven it be state-matters as you think
[SHK] And no conception nor no jealous toy
[SHK] Concerning you
[SHK] Alas the day I never gave him cause
[SHK] But jealous souls will not be answer 'd so
[SHK] They are not ever jealous for the cause
[SHK] But jealous for they are jealous 't is a monster
[SHK] Begot upon itself born on itself
[SHK] Heaven keep that monster from Othello 's mind
[SHK] Lady amen
[SHK] I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout
[SHK] If I do find him fit I 'll move your suit
[SHK] And seek to effect it to my uttermost
[SHK] I humbly thank your ladyship
[SHK] Save you friend Cassio
[SHK] What make you from home
[SHK] How is it with you my most fair Bianca
[SHK] I faith sweet love I was coming to your house
[SHK] And I was going to your lodging Cassio
[SHK] What keep a week away seven days and nights
[SHK] Eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours
[SHK] More tedious than the dial eight score times
[SHK] O weary reckoning
[SHK] Pardon me Bianca
[SHK] I have this while with leaden thoughts been press 'd
[SHK] But I shall in a more continuate time
[SHK] Strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca
[SHK] Take me this work out
[SHK] O Cassio whence came this
[SHK] This is some token from a newer friend
[SHK] To the felt absence now I feel a cause
[SHK] Is't come to this Well well
[SHK] Go to woman
[SHK] Throw your vile guesses in the devil 's teeth
[SHK] From whence you have them You are jealous now
[SHK] That this is from some mistress some remembrance
[SHK] No in good troth Bianca
[SHK] Why whose is it
[SHK] I know not sweet I found it in my chamber
[SHK] I like the work well ere it be demanded --
[SHK] As like enough it will -- I'ld have it copied
[SHK] Take it and do't and leave me for this time
[SHK] Leave you wherefore
[SHK] I do attend here on the general
[SHK] And think it no addition nor my wish
[SHK] To have him see me woman 'd
[SHK] Why I pray you
[SHK] Not that I love you not
[SHK] But that you do not love me
[SHK] I pray you bring me on the way a little
[SHK] And say if I shall see you soon at night
[SHK] 'T is but a little way that I can bring you
[SHK] For I attend here but I 'll see you soon
[SHK] 'T is very good I must be circumstanced
[SHK] Will you think so
[SHK] Think so Iago
[SHK] What
[SHK] To kiss in private
[SHK] An unauthorized kiss
[SHK] Or to be naked with her friend in bed
[SHK] An hour or more not meaning any harm
[SHK] Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm
[SHK] It is hypocrisy against the devil
[SHK] They that mean virtuously and yet do so
[SHK] The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
[SHK] So they do nothing 't is a venial slip
[SHK] But if I give my wife a handkerchief --
[SHK] What then
[SHK] Why then 't is hers my lord and being hers
[SHK] She may I think bestow't on any man
[SHK] She is protectress of her honour too
[SHK] May she give that
[SHK] Her honour is an essence that 's not seen
[SHK] They have it very oft that have it not
[SHK] But for the handkerchief --
[SHK] By heaven I would most gladly have forgot it
[SHK] Thou said'st it comes o'er my memory
[SHK] As doth the raven o'er the infected house
[SHK] Boding to all -- he had my handkerchief
[SHK] Ay what of that
[SHK] That 's not so good now
[SHK] What
[SHK] If I had said I had seen him do you wrong
[SHK] Or heard him say -- as knaves be such abroad
[SHK] Who having by their own importunate suit
[SHK] Or voluntary dotage of some mistress
[SHK] Convinced or supplied them can not choose
[SHK] But they must blab --
[SHK] Hath he said any thing
[SHK] He hath my lord but be you well assured
[SHK] No more than he 'll unswear
[SHK] What hath he said
[SHK] 'Faith that he did -- I know not what he did
[SHK] What what
[SHK] Lie --
[SHK] With her
[SHK] With her on her what you will
[SHK] Lie with her lie on her We say lie on her when
[SHK] they belie her Lie with her that 's fulsome
[SHK] -- Handkerchief -- confessions -- handkerchief -- To
[SHK] confess and be hanged for his labour -- first to be
[SHK] hanged and then to confess. -- I tremble at it
[SHK] Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
[SHK] passion without some instruction It is not words
[SHK] that shake me thus Pish Noses ears and lips
[SHK] -- Is't possible -- Confess -- handkerchief -- O devil --
[SHK] Work on
[SHK] My medicine work Thus credulous fools are caught
[SHK] And many worthy and chaste dames even thus
[SHK] All guiltless meet reproach What ho my lord
[SHK] My lord I say Othello
[SHK] How now Cassio
[SHK] What 's the matter
[SHK] My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy
[SHK] This is his second fit he had one yesterday
[SHK] Rub him about the temples
[SHK] No forbear
[SHK] The lethargy must have his quiet course
[SHK] If not he foams at mouth and by and by
[SHK] Breaks out to savage madness Look he stirs
[SHK] Do you withdraw yourself a little while
[SHK] He will recover straight when he is gone
[SHK] I would on great occasion speak with you
[SHK] How is it general have you not hurt your head
[SHK] Dost thou mock me
[SHK] I mock you no by heaven
[SHK] Would you would bear your fortune like a man
[SHK] A horned man 's a monster and a beast
[SHK] There 's many a beast then in a populous city
[SHK] And many a civil monster
[SHK] Did he confess it
[SHK] Good sir be a man
[SHK] Think every bearded fellow that 's but yoked
[SHK] May draw with you there 's millions now alive
[SHK] That nightly lie in those unproper beds
[SHK] Which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
[SHK] O 't is the spite of hell the fiend 's arch-mock
[SHK] To lip a wanton in a secure couch
[SHK] And to suppose her chaste No let me know
[SHK] And knowing what I am I know what she shall be
[SHK] O thou art wise 't is certain
[SHK] Stand you awhile apart
[SHK] Confine yourself but in a patient list
[SHK] Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief --
[SHK] A passion most unsuiting such a man --
[SHK] Cassio came hither I shifted him away
[SHK] And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy
[SHK] Bade him anon return and here speak with me
[SHK] The which he promised Do but encave yourself
[SHK] And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
[SHK] That dwell in every region of his face
[SHK] For I will make him tell the tale anew
[SHK] Where how how oft how long ago and when
[SHK] He hath and is again to cope your wife
[SHK] I say but mark his gesture Marry patience
[SHK] Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen
[SHK] And nothing of a man
[SHK] Dost thou hear Iago
[SHK] I will be found most cunning in my patience
[SHK] But -- dost thou hear -- most bloody
[SHK] That 's not amiss
[SHK] But yet keep time in all Will you withdraw
[SHK] Now will I question Cassio of Bianca
[SHK] A housewife that by selling her desires
[SHK] Buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature
[SHK] That dotes on Cassio as 't is the strumpet 's plague
[SHK] To beguile many and be beguiled by one
[SHK] He when he hears of her can not refrain
[SHK] From the excess of laughter Here he comes
[SHK] As he shall smile Othello shall go mad
[SHK] And his unbookish jealousy must construe
[SHK] Poor Cassio 's smiles gestures and light behavior
[SHK] Quite in the wrong How do you now lieutenant
[SHK] The worser that you give me the addition
[SHK] Whose want even kills me
[SHK] Ply Desdemona well and you are sure o n't
[SHK] Now if this suit lay in Bianco 's power
[SHK] How quickly should you speed
[SHK] Alas poor caitiff
[SHK] Look how he laughs already
[SHK] I never knew woman love man so
[SHK] Alas poor rogue I think i faith she loves me
[SHK] Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
[SHK] Do you hear Cassio
[SHK] Now he importunes him
[SHK] To tell it o'er go to well said well said
[SHK] She gives it out that you shall marry hey
[SHK] Do you intend it
[SHK] Ha ha ha
[SHK] Do you triumph Roman do you triumph
[SHK] I marry her what a customer Prithee bear some
[SHK] charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome
[SHK] Ha ha ha
[SHK] So so so so they laugh that win
[SHK] 'Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her
[SHK] Prithee say true
[SHK] I am a very villain else
[SHK] Have you scored me Well
[SHK] This is the monkey 's own giving out she is
[SHK] persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and
[SHK] flattery not out of my promise
[SHK] Iago beckons me now he begins the story
[SHK] She was here even now she haunts me in every place
[SHK] I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
[SHK] certain Venetians and thither comes the bauble
[SHK] and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck --
[SHK] Crying O dear Cassio as it were his gesture
[SHK] imports it
[SHK] So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales
[SHK] and pulls me ha ha ha
[SHK] Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber O
[SHK] I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall
[SHK] throw it to
[SHK] Well I must leave her company
[SHK] Before me look where she comes
[SHK] 'T is such another fitchew marry a perfumed one
[SHK] What do you mean by this haunting of me
[SHK] Let the devil and his dam haunt you What did you
[SHK] mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now
[SHK] I was a fine fool to take it I must take out the
[SHK] work -- A likely piece of work that you should find
[SHK] it in your chamber and not know who left it there
[SHK] This is some minx 's token and I must take out the
[SHK] work There give it your hobby-horse wheresoever
[SHK] you had it I 'll take out no work o n't

[SHK] O Iago
[SHK] And did you see the handkerchief
[SHK] Was that mine
[SHK] Yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the
[SHK] foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he
[SHK] hath given it his whore
[SHK] I would have him nine years a-killing
[SHK] A fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman
[SHK] Nay you must forget that
[SHK] Ay let her rot and perish and be damned to-night
[SHK] for she shall not live no my heart is turned to
[SHK] stone I strike it and it hurts my hand O the
[SHK] world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by
[SHK] an emperor 's side and command him tasks
[SHK] Nay that 's not your way
[SHK] Hang her I do but say what she is so delicate
[SHK] with her needle an admirable musician O she
[SHK] will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high
[SHK] and plenteous wit and invention --
[SHK] She 's the worse for all this

[SHK] gentle a condition
[SHK] Ay too gentle
[SHK] Nay that 's certain but yet the pity of it Iago
[SHK] O Iago the pity of it Iago

[SHK] Are you sure of that
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] He did not call he 's busy in the paper

[SHK] A most unhappy one I would do much
[SHK] To atone them for the love I bear to Cassio
[SHK] Fire and brimstone
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] Are you wise
[SHK] What is he angry
[SHK] May be the letter moved him
[SHK] For as I think they do command him home

[SHK] Indeed
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] I am glad to see you mad
[SHK] Why sweet Othello --

[SHK] Make her amends she weeps
[SHK] O devil devil
[SHK] If that the earth could teem with woman 's tears
[SHK] Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile

[SHK] Truly an obedient lady
[SHK] I do beseech your lordship call her back
[SHK] Mistress
[SHK] My lord

[SHK] And will return to Venice Hence avaunt
[SHK] Cassio shall have my place And sir tonight
[SHK] I do entreat that we may sup together
[SHK] You are welcome sir to Cyprus. -- Goats and monkeys
[SHK] Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
[SHK] Call all in all sufficient Is this the nature
[SHK] Whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue
[SHK] The shot of accident nor dart of chance
[SHK] Could neither graze nor pierce
[SHK] He is much changed
[SHK] Are his wits safe is he not light of brain
[SHK] He 's that he is I may not breathe my censure
[SHK] What he might be if what he might he is not
[SHK] I would to heaven he were
[SHK] What strike his wife
[SHK] 'Faith that was not so well yet would I knew
[SHK] That stroke would prove the worst
[SHK] Is it his use
[SHK] Or did the letters work upon his blood
[SHK] And new-create this fault
[SHK] Alas alas
[SHK] It is not honesty in me to speak
[SHK] What I have seen and known You shall observe him
[SHK] And his own courses will denote him so
[SHK] That I may save my speech do but go after
[SHK] And mark how he continues
[SHK] I am sorry that I am deceived in him
[SHK] You have seen nothing then
[SHK] Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
[SHK] Yes you have seen Cassio and she together
[SHK] But then I saw no harm and then I heard
[SHK] Each syllable that breath made up between them
[SHK] What did they never whisper
[SHK] Never my lord
[SHK] Nor send you out o the way
[SHK] Never
[SHK] To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
[SHK] Never my lord
[SHK] That 's strange
[SHK] I durst my lord to wager she is honest
[SHK] Lay down my soul at stake if you think other
[SHK] Remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
[SHK] If any wretch have put this in your head
[SHK] Let heaven requite it with the serpent 's curse
[SHK] For if she be not honest chaste and true
[SHK] There 's no man happy the purest of their wives
[SHK] Is foul as slander
[SHK] Bid her come hither go
[SHK] She says enough yet she 's a simple bawd
[SHK] That can not say as much This is a subtle whore
[SHK] A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
[SHK] And yet she 'll kneel and pray I have seen her do't
[SHK] My lord what is your will
[SHK] Pray chuck come hither
[SHK] What is your pleasure
[SHK] Let me see your eyes
[SHK] Look in my face
[SHK] What horrible fancy 's this
[SHK] Leave procreants alone and shut the door
[SHK] Cough or cry 'hem if any body come
[SHK] Your mystery your mystery nay dispatch
[SHK] Upon my knees what doth your speech import
[SHK] I understand a fury in your words
[SHK] But not the words
[SHK] Why what art thou
[SHK] Your wife my lord your true
[SHK] And loyal wife
[SHK] Come swear it damn thyself
[SHK] Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
[SHK] Should fear to seize thee therefore be double damn 'd
[SHK] Swear thou art honest
[SHK] Heaven doth truly know it
[SHK] Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
[SHK] To whom my lord with whom how am I false
[SHK] O Desdemona away away away
[SHK] Alas the heavy day Why do you weep
[SHK] Am I the motive of these tears my lord
[SHK] If haply you my father do suspect
[SHK] An instrument of this your calling back
[SHK] Lay not your blame on me If you have lost him
[SHK] Why I have lost him too
[SHK] Had it pleased heaven
[SHK] To try me with affliction had they rain 'd
[SHK] All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
[SHK] Steep 'd me in poverty to the very lips
[SHK] Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
[SHK] I should have found in some place of my soul
[SHK] A drop of patience but alas to make me
[SHK] A fixed figure for the time of scorn
[SHK] To point his slow unmoving finger at
[SHK] Yet could I bear that too well very well
[SHK] But there where I have garner 'd up my heart
[SHK] Where either I must live or bear no life
[SHK] The fountain from the which my current runs
[SHK] Or else dries up to be discarded thence
[SHK] Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
[SHK] To knot and gender in Turn thy complexion there
[SHK] Patience thou young and rose-lipp 'd cherubin --
[SHK] Ay there look grim as hell
[SHK] I hope my noble lord esteems me honest
[SHK] O ay as summer flies are in the shambles
[SHK] That quicken even with blowing O thou weed
[SHK] Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
[SHK] That the sense aches at thee would thou hadst
[SHK] ne'er been born
[SHK] Alas what ignorant sin have I committed
[SHK] Was this fair paper this most goodly book
[SHK] Made to write 'whore upon What committed
[SHK] Committed O thou public commoner
[SHK] I should make very forges of my cheeks
[SHK] That would to cinders burn up modesty
[SHK] Did I but speak thy deeds What committed
[SHK] Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
[SHK] The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
[SHK] Is hush 'd within the hollow mine of earth
[SHK] And will not hear it What committed
[SHK] Impudent strumpet
[SHK] By heaven you do me wrong
[SHK] Are you not a strumpet
[SHK] No as I am a Christian
[SHK] If to preserve this vessel for my lord
[SHK] From any other foul unlawful touch
[SHK] Be not to be a strumpet I am none
[SHK] What not a whore
[SHK] No as I shall be saved
[SHK] Is't possible
[SHK] O heaven forgive us
[SHK] I cry you mercy then
[SHK] I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
[SHK] That married with Othello
[SHK] You mistress
[SHK] That have the office opposite to Saint Peter
[SHK] And keep the gate of hell
[SHK] You you ay you
[SHK] We have done our course there 's money for your pains
[SHK] I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel
[SHK] Alas what does this gentleman conceive
[SHK] How do you madam how do you my good lady
[SHK] 'Faith half asleep
[SHK] Good madam what 's the matter with my lord
[SHK] With who
[SHK] Why with my lord madam
[SHK] Who is thy lord
[SHK] He that is yours sweet lady
[SHK] I have none do not talk to me Emilia
[SHK] I can not weep nor answer have I none
[SHK] But what should go by water Prithee tonight
[SHK] Lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember
[SHK] And call thy husband hither
[SHK] Here 's a change indeed
[SHK] 'T is meet I should be used so very meet
[SHK] How have I been behaved that he might stick
[SHK] The small'st opinion on my least misuse
[SHK] What is your pleasure madam
[SHK] How is't with you
[SHK] I can not tell Those that do teach young babes
[SHK] Do it with gentle means and easy tasks
[SHK] He might have chid me so for in good faith
[SHK] I am a child to chiding
[SHK] What 's the matter lady
[SHK] Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her
[SHK] Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
[SHK] As true hearts can not bear
[SHK] Am I that name Iago
[SHK] What name fair lady
[SHK] Such as she says my lord did say I was
[SHK] He call 'd her whore a beggar in his drink
[SHK] Could not have laid such terms upon his callat
[SHK] Why did he so
[SHK] I do not know I am sure I am none such
[SHK] Do not weep do not weep Alas the day
[SHK] Hath she forsook so many noble matches
[SHK] Her father and her country and her friends
[SHK] To be call 'd whore would it not make one weep
[SHK] It is my wretched fortune
[SHK] Beshrew him for't
[SHK] How comes this trick upon him
[SHK] Nay heaven doth know
[SHK] I will be hang 'd if some eternal villain
[SHK] Some busy and insinuating rogue
[SHK] Some cogging cozening slave to get some office
[SHK] Have not devised this slander I 'll be hang 'd else
[SHK] Fie there is no such man it is impossible
[SHK] If any such there be heaven pardon him
[SHK] A halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones
[SHK] Why should he call her whore who keeps her company
[SHK] What place what time what form what likelihood
[SHK] The Moor 's abused by some most villanous knave
[SHK] Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
[SHK] O heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfold
[SHK] And put in every honest hand a whip
[SHK] To lash the rascals naked through the world
[SHK] Even from the east to the west
[SHK] Speak within door
[SHK] O fie upon them Some such squire he was
[SHK] That turn 'd your wit the seamy side without
[SHK] And made you to suspect me with the Moor
[SHK] You are a fool go to
[SHK] O good Iago
[SHK] What shall I do to win my lord again
[SHK] Good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
[SHK] I know not how I lost him Here I kneel
[SHK] If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love
[SHK] Either in discourse of thought or actual deed
[SHK] Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
[SHK] Delighted them in any other form
[SHK] Or that I do not yet and ever did
[SHK] And ever will -- though he do shake me off
[SHK] To beggarly divorcement -- love him dearly
[SHK] Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much
[SHK] And his unkindness may defeat my life
[SHK] But never taint my love I can not say 'whore
[SHK] It does abhor me now I speak the word
[SHK] To do the act that might the addition earn
[SHK] Not the world 's mass of vanity could make me
[SHK] I pray you be content 't is but his humour
[SHK] The business of the state does him offence
[SHK] And he does chide with you
[SHK] If 'twere no other --
[SHK] 'T is but so I warrant
[SHK] Hark how these instruments summon to supper
[SHK] The messengers of Venice stay the meat
[SHK] Go in and weep not all things shall be well
[SHK] How now Roderigo
[SHK] I do not find that thou dealest justly with me
[SHK] What in the contrary
[SHK] Every day thou daffest me with some device Iago
[SHK] and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me
[SHK] all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
[SHK] advantage of hope I will indeed no longer endure
[SHK] it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
[SHK] already I have foolishly suffered
[SHK] Will you hear me Roderigo
[SHK] 'Faith I have heard too much for your words and
[SHK] performances are no kin together
[SHK] You charge me most unjustly
[SHK] With nought but truth I have wasted myself out of
[SHK] my means The jewels you have had from me to
[SHK] deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
[SHK] votarist you have told me she hath received them
[SHK] and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
[SHK] respect and acquaintance but I find none
[SHK] Well go to very well
[SHK] Very well go to I can not go to man nor 't is
[SHK] not very well nay I think it is scurvy and begin
[SHK] to find myself fobbed in it
[SHK] Very well
[SHK] I tell you 't is not very well I will make myself
[SHK] known to Desdemona if she will return me my
[SHK] jewels I will give over my suit and repent my
[SHK] unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself I
[SHK] will seek satisfaction of you
[SHK] You have said now
[SHK] Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing
[SHK] Why now I see there 's mettle in thee and even from
[SHK] this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
[SHK] ever before Give me thy hand Roderigo thou hast
[SHK] taken against me a most just exception but yet I
[SHK] protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair
[SHK] It hath not appeared
[SHK] I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your
[SHK] suspicion is not without wit and judgment But
[SHK] Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which I
[SHK] have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean
[SHK] purpose courage and valour this night show it if
[SHK] thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona
[SHK] take me from this world with treachery and devise
[SHK] engines for my life
[SHK] Well what is it is it within reason and compass
[SHK] Sir there is especial commission come from Venice
[SHK] to depute Cassio in Othello 's place
[SHK] Is that true why then Othello and Desdemona
[SHK] return again to Venice
[SHK] O no he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
[SHK] him the fair Desdemona unless his abode be
[SHK] lingered here by some accident wherein none can be
[SHK] so determinate as the removing of Cassio
[SHK] How do you mean removing of him
[SHK] Why by making him uncapable of Othello 's place
[SHK] knocking out his brains
[SHK] And that you would have me to do
[SHK] Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
[SHK] He sups to-night with a harlotry and thither will I
[SHK] go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable
[SHK] fortune If you will watch his going thence which
[SHK] I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one
[SHK] you may take him at your pleasure I will be near
[SHK] to second your attempt and he shall fall between
[SHK] us Come stand not amazed at it but go along with
[SHK] me I will show you such a necessity in his death
[SHK] that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
[SHK] him It is now high suppertime and the night grows
[SHK] to waste about it
[SHK] I will hear further reason for this
[SHK] And you shall be satisfied
[SHK] I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
[SHK] O pardon me 'twill do me good to walk
[SHK] Madam good night I humbly thank your ladyship
[SHK] Your honour is most welcome
[SHK] Will you walk sir
[SHK] O -- Desdemona --
[SHK] My lord
[SHK] Get you to bed on the instant I will be returned
[SHK] forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done
[SHK] I will my lord
[SHK] How goes it now he looks gentler than he did
[SHK] He says he will return incontinent
[SHK] He hath commanded me to go to bed
[SHK] And bade me to dismiss you
[SHK] Dismiss me
[SHK] It was his bidding therefore good Emilia
[SHK] Give me my nightly wearing and adieu
[SHK] We must not now displease him
[SHK] I would you had never seen him
[SHK] So would not I my love doth so approve him
[SHK] That even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns --
[SHK] Prithee unpin me -- have grace and favour in them
[SHK] I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
[SHK] All 's one Good faith how foolish are our minds
[SHK] If I do die before thee prithee shroud me
[SHK] In one of those same sheets
[SHK] Come come you talk
[SHK] My mother had a maid call 'd Barbara
[SHK] She was in love and he she loved proved mad
[SHK] And did forsake her she had a song of 'willow
[SHK] An old thing 't was but it express 'd her fortune
[SHK] And she died singing it that song to-night
[SHK] Will not go from my mind I have much to do
[SHK] But to go hang my head all at one side
[SHK] And sing it like poor Barbara Prithee dispatch
[SHK] Shall I go fetch your night-gown
[SHK] No unpin me here
[SHK] This Lodovico is a proper man
[SHK] A very handsome man
[SHK] He speaks well
[SHK] I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
[SHK] to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
[SHK] Sing all a green willow
[SHK] Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
[SHK] Sing willow willow willow
[SHK] The fresh streams ran by her and murmur 'd her moans
[SHK] Sing willow willow willow
[SHK] Her salt tears fell from her and soften 'd the stones
[SHK] Lay by these --
[SHK] Sing willow willow willow
[SHK] Prithee hie thee he 'll come anon --
[SHK] Sing all a green willow must be my garland
[SHK] Let nobody blame him his scorn I approve
[SHK] Nay that 's not next. -- Hark who is't that knocks
[SHK] It 's the wind
[SHK] said he then
[SHK] Sing willow willow willow
[SHK] If I court moe women you 'll couch with moe men
[SHK] So get thee gone good night Ate eyes do itch
[SHK] Doth that bode weeping
[SHK] 'T is neither here nor there
[SHK] I have heard it said so O these men these men
[SHK] Dost thou in conscience think -- tell me Emilia --
[SHK] That there be women do abuse their husbands
[SHK] In such gross kind
[SHK] There be some such no question
[SHK] Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
[SHK] Why would not you
[SHK] No by this heavenly light
[SHK] Nor I neither by this heavenly light
[SHK] I might do't as well i the dark
[SHK] Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
[SHK] The world 's a huge thing it is a great price
[SHK] For a small vice
[SHK] In troth I think thou wouldst not
[SHK] In troth I think I should and undo't when I had
[SHK] done Marry I would not do such a thing for a
[SHK] joint-ring nor for measures of lawn nor for
[SHK] gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty
[SHK] exhibition but for the whole world -- why who would
[SHK] not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
[SHK] monarch I should venture purgatory for't
[SHK] Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong
[SHK] For the whole world
[SHK] Why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and
[SHK] having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your
[SHK] own world and you might quickly make it right
[SHK] I do not think there is any such woman
[SHK] Yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would
[SHK] store the world they played for
[SHK] But I do think it is their husbands faults
[SHK] If wives do fall say that they slack their duties
[SHK] And pour our treasures into foreign laps
[SHK] Or else break out in peevish jealousies
[SHK] Throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
[SHK] Or scant our former having in despite
[SHK] Why we have galls and though we have some grace
[SHK] Yet have we some revenge Let husbands know
[SHK] Their wives have sense like them they see and smell
[SHK] And have their palates both for sweet and sour
[SHK] As husbands have What is it that they do
[SHK] When they change us for others Is it sport
[SHK] I think it is and doth affection breed it
[SHK] I think it doth is't frailty that thus errs
[SHK] It is so too and have not we affections
[SHK] Desires for sport and frailty as men have
[SHK] Then let them use us well else let them know
[SHK] The ills we do their ills instruct us so
[SHK] Good night good night heaven me such uses send
[SHK] Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
[SHK] Here stand behind this bulk straight will he come

[SHK] And fix most firm thy resolution
[SHK] Be near at hand I may miscarry i n't

[SHK] 'T is but a man gone Forth my sword he dies
[SHK] I have rubb 'd this young quat almost to the sense
[SHK] And he grows angry Now whether he kill Cassio
[SHK] Or Cassio him or each do kill the other
[SHK] Every way makes my gain live Roderigo
[SHK] He calls me to a restitution large
[SHK] Of gold and jewels that I bobb 'd from him
[SHK] As gifts to Desdemona
[SHK] It must not be if Cassio do remain
[SHK] He hath a daily beauty in his life
[SHK] That makes me ugly and besides the Moor
[SHK] May unfold me to him there stand I in much peril
[SHK] No he must die But so I hear him coming

[SHK] Will you go on I pray
[SHK] This is the night
[SHK] That either makes me or fordoes me quite
[SHK] It is the cause it is the cause my soul --
[SHK] Let me not name it to you you chaste stars --
[SHK] It is the cause Yet I 'll not shed her blood
[SHK] Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
[SHK] And smooth as monumental alabaster
[SHK] Yet she must die else she 'll betray more men
[SHK] Put out the light and then put out the light
[SHK] If I quench thee thou flaming minister
[SHK] I can again thy former light restore
[SHK] Should I repent me but once put out thy light
[SHK] Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature
[SHK] I know not where is that Promethean heat
[SHK] That can thy light relume When I have pluck 'd the rose
[SHK] I can not give it vital growth again
[SHK] It must needs wither I 'll smell it on the tree
[SHK] Ah balmy breath that dost almost persuade
[SHK] Justice to break her sword One more one more
[SHK] Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee
[SHK] And love thee after One more and this the last
[SHK] So sweet was ne'er so fatal I must weep
[SHK] But they are cruel tears this sorrow 's heavenly
[SHK] It strikes where it doth love She wakes
[SHK] Who 's there Othello
[SHK] Ay Desdemona
[SHK] Will you come to bed my lord
[SHK] Have you pray 'd to-night Desdemona
[SHK] Ay my lord
[SHK] If you bethink yourself of any crime
[SHK] Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
[SHK] Solicit for it straight
[SHK] Alas my lord what do you mean by that
[SHK] Well do it and be brief I will walk by
[SHK] I would not kill thy unprepared spirit
[SHK] No heaven forfend I would not kill thy soul
[SHK] Talk you of killing
[SHK] Ay I do
[SHK] Then heaven
[SHK] Have mercy on me
[SHK] Amen with all my heart
[SHK] If you say so I hope you will not kill me
[SHK] Hum
[SHK] And yet I fear you for you are fatal then
[SHK] When your eyes roll so why I should fear I know not
[SHK] Since guiltiness I know not but yet I feel I fear
[SHK] Think on thy sins
[SHK] They are loves I bear to you
[SHK] Ay and for that thou diest
[SHK] That death 's unnatural that kills for loving
[SHK] Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
[SHK] Some bloody passion shakes your very frame
[SHK] These are portents but yet I hope I hope
[SHK] They do not point on me
[SHK] Peace and be still
[SHK] I will so What 's the matter
[SHK] That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
[SHK] Thou gavest to Cassio
[SHK] No by my life and soul
[SHK] Send for the man and ask him
[SHK] Sweet soul take heed
[SHK] Take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed
[SHK] Ay but not yet to die
[SHK] Yes presently
[SHK] Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
[SHK] For to deny each article with oath
[SHK] Can not remove nor choke the strong conception
[SHK] That I do groan withal Thou art to die
[SHK] Then Lord have mercy on me
[SHK] I say amen
[SHK] And have you mercy too I never did
[SHK] Offend you in my life never loved Cassio
[SHK] But with such general warranty of heaven
[SHK] As I might love I never gave him token
[SHK] By heaven I saw my handkerchief in 's hand
[SHK] O perjured woman thou dost stone my heart
[SHK] And makest me call what I intend to do
[SHK] A murder which I thought a sacrifice
[SHK] I saw the handkerchief
[SHK] He found it then
[SHK] I never gave it him send for him hither
[SHK] Let him confess a truth
[SHK] He hath confess 'd
[SHK] What my lord
[SHK] That he hath used thee
[SHK] How unlawfully
[SHK] Ay
[SHK] He will not say so
[SHK] No his mouth is stopp 'd
[SHK] Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't
[SHK] O my fear interprets what is he dead
[SHK] Had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
[SHK] Had stomach for them all
[SHK] Alas he is betray 'd and I undone
[SHK] Out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face
[SHK] O banish me my lord but kill me not
[SHK] Down strumpet
[SHK] Kill me to-morrow let me live to-night
[SHK] Nay if you strive --
[SHK] But half an hour
[SHK] Being done there is no pause
[SHK] But while I say one prayer
[SHK] It is too late
[SHK] What noise is this Not dead not yet quite dead
[SHK] I that am cruel am yet merciful
[SHK] I would not have thee linger in thy pain So so
[SHK] Who 's there
[SHK] Yes 't is Emilia By and by She 's dead
[SHK] 'T is like she comes to speak of Cassio 's death. --
[SHK] The noise was here Ha no more moving
[SHK] Still as the grave Shall she come in were't good --
[SHK] I think she stirs again -- no What 's best to do
[SHK] If she come in she 'll sure speak to my wife
[SHK] My wife my wife what wife I have no wife
[SHK] O insupportable O heavy hour
[SHK] Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
[SHK] Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
[SHK] Should yawn at alteration
[SHK] That I may speak with you O good my lord
[SHK] I had forgot thee O come in Emilia
[SHK] Soft by and by Let me the curtains draw
[SHK] Where art thou
[SHK] What 's the matter with thee now
[SHK] O my good lord yonder 's foul murders done
[SHK] What now
[SHK] But now my lord
[SHK] It is the very error of the moon
[SHK] She comes more nearer earth than she was wont
[SHK] And makes men mad
[SHK] Cassio my lord hath kill 'd a young Venetian
[SHK] Call 'd Roderigo
[SHK] Roderigo kill 'd
[SHK] And Cassio kill 'd
[SHK] No Cassio is not kill 'd
[SHK] Not Cassio kill 'd then murder 's out of tune
[SHK] And sweet revenge grows harsh
[SHK] O falsely falsely murder 'd
[SHK] Alas what cry is that
[SHK] That what
[SHK] Out and alas that was my lady 's voice
[SHK] Help help ho help O lady speak again
[SHK] Sweet Desdemona O sweet mistress speak
[SHK] A guiltless death I die
[SHK] O who hath done this deed
[SHK] Nobody I myself Farewell
[SHK] Commend me to my kind lord O farewell
[SHK] Why how should she be murder 'd
[SHK] Alas who knows
[SHK] You heard her say herself it was not I
[SHK] She said so I must needs report the truth
[SHK] She 's like a liar gone to burning hell
[SHK] 'T was I that kill 'd her
[SHK] O the more angel she
[SHK] And you the blacker devil
[SHK] She turn 'd to folly and she was a whore
[SHK] Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
[SHK] She was false as water
[SHK] Thou art rash as fire to say
[SHK] That she was false O she was heavenly true
[SHK] Cassio did top her ask thy husband else
[SHK] O I were damn 'd beneath all depth in hell
[SHK] But that I did proceed upon just grounds
[SHK] To this extremity Thy husband knew it all
[SHK] My husband
[SHK] Thy husband
[SHK] That she was false to wedlock
[SHK] Ay with Cassio Nay had she been true
[SHK] If heaven would make me such another world
[SHK] Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite
[SHK] I'ld not have sold her for it
[SHK] My husband
[SHK] Ay 't was he that told me first
[SHK] An honest man he is and hates the slime
[SHK] That sticks on filthy deeds
[SHK] My husband
[SHK] What needs this iteration woman I say thy husband
[SHK] O mistress villany hath made mocks with love
[SHK] My husband say that she was false
[SHK] He woman
[SHK] I say thy husband dost understand the word
[SHK] My friend thy husband honest honest Iago
[SHK] If he say so may his pernicious soul
[SHK] Rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart
[SHK] She was too fond of her most filthy bargain
[SHK] Ha
[SHK] Do thy worst
[SHK] This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
[SHK] Than thou wast worthy her
[SHK] Peace you were best
[SHK] Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
[SHK] As I have to be hurt O gull O dolt
[SHK] As ignorant as dirt thou hast done a deed --
[SHK] I care not for thy sword I 'll make thee known
[SHK] Though I lost twenty lives. -- Help help ho help
[SHK] The Moor hath kill 'd my mistress Murder murder
[SHK] What is the matter How now general
[SHK] O are you come Iago you have done well
[SHK] That men must lay their murders on your neck
[SHK] What is the matter
[SHK] Disprove this villain if thou be'st a man
[SHK] He says thou told'st him that his wife was false
[SHK] I know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain
[SHK] Speak for my heart is full
[SHK] I told him what I thought and told no more
[SHK] Than what he found himself was apt and true
[SHK] But did you ever tell him she was false
[SHK] I did
[SHK] You told a lie an odious damned lie
[SHK] Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
[SHK] She false with Cassio -- did you say with Cassio
[SHK] With Cassio mistress Go to charm your tongue
[SHK] I will not charm my tongue I am bound to speak
[SHK] My mistress here lies murder 'd in her bed --
[SHK] O heavens forfend
[SHK] And your reports have set the murder on
[SHK] Nay stare not masters it is true indeed
[SHK] 'T is a strange truth
[SHK] O monstrous act
[SHK] Villany villany villany
[SHK] I think upo n't I think I smell't O villany --
[SHK] I thought so then -- I 'll kill myself for grief --
[SHK] O villany villany
[SHK] What are you mad I charge you get you home
[SHK] Good gentlemen let me have leave to speak
[SHK] 'T is proper I obey him but not now
[SHK] Perchance Iago I will ne'er go home
[SHK] O O O
[SHK] Nay lay thee down and roar
[SHK] For thou hast kill 'd the sweetest innocent
[SHK] That e'er did lift up eye
[SHK] I scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece
[SHK] Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp 'd
[SHK] I know this act shows horrible and grim
[SHK] Poor Desdemona I am glad thy father 's dead
[SHK] Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
[SHK] Shore his old thread in twain did he live now
[SHK] This sight would make him do a desperate turn
[SHK] Yea curse his better angel from his side
[SHK] And fall to reprobation
[SHK] 'T is pitiful but yet Iago knows
[SHK] That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
[SHK] A thousand times committed Cassio confess 'd it
[SHK] And she did gratify his amorous works
[SHK] With that recognizance and pledge of love
[SHK] Which I first gave her I saw it in his hand
[SHK] It was a handkerchief an antique token
[SHK] My father gave my mother
[SHK] O heaven O heavenly powers
[SHK] Come hold your peace
[SHK] 'Twill out 'twill out I peace
[SHK] No I will speak as liberal as the north
[SHK] Let heaven and men and devils let them all
[SHK] All all cry shame against me yet I 'll speak
[SHK] Be wise and get you home
[SHK] I will not
[SHK] Fie
[SHK] Your sword upon a woman
[SHK] O thou dull Moor that handkerchief thou speak'st of
[SHK] I found by fortune and did give my husband
[SHK] For often with a solemn earnestness
[SHK] More than indeed belong 'd to such a trifle
[SHK] He begg 'd of me to steal it
[SHK] Villanous whore
[SHK] She give it Cassio no alas I found it
[SHK] And I did give't my husband
[SHK] Filth thou liest
[SHK] By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen
[SHK] O murderous coxcomb what should such a fool
[SHK] Do with so good a woman
[SHK] Are there no stones in heaven
[SHK] But what serve for the thunder -- Precious villain
[SHK] The woman falls sure he hath kill 'd his wife
[SHK] Ay ay O lay me by my mistress side
[SHK] He 's gone but his wife 's kill 'd
[SHK] 'T is a notorious villain Take you this weapon
[SHK] Which I have here recover 'd from the Moor
[SHK] Come guard the door without let him not pass
[SHK] But kill him rather I 'll after that same villain
[SHK] For 't is a damned slave
[SHK] I am not valiant neither
[SHK] But ever puny whipster gets my sword
[SHK] But why should honour outlive honesty
[SHK] Let it go all
[SHK] What did thy song bode lady
[SHK] Hark canst thou hear me I will play the swan
[SHK] And die in music
[SHK] Willow willow willow --
[SHK] Moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel Moor
[SHK] So come my soul to bliss as I speak true
[SHK] So speaking as I think I die I die
[SHK] I have another weapon in this chamber
[SHK] It is a sword of Spain the ice-brook 's temper --
[SHK] O here it is Uncle I must come forth
[SHK] Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer
[SHK] Look in upon me then and speak with me
[SHK] Or naked as I am I will assault thee
[SHK] What is the matter
[SHK] Behold I have a weapon
[SHK] A better never did itself sustain
[SHK] Upon a soldier 's thigh I have seen the day
[SHK] That with this little arm and this good sword
[SHK] I have made my way through more impediments
[SHK] Than twenty times your stop but O vain boast
[SHK] Who can control his fate 't is not so now
[SHK] Be not afraid though you do see me weapon 'd
[SHK] Here is my journey 's end here is my butt
[SHK] And very sea-mark of my utmost sail
[SHK] Do you go back dismay 'd 't is a lost fear
[SHK] Man but a rush against Othello 's breast
[SHK] And he retires Where should Othello go
[SHK] Now how dost thou look now O ill-starr 'd wench
[SHK] Pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt
[SHK] This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
[SHK] And fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl
[SHK] Even like thy chastity O cursed slave
[SHK] Whip me ye devils
[SHK] From the possession of this heavenly sight
[SHK] Blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur
[SHK] Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire
[SHK] O Desdemona Desdemona dead
[SHK] Oh Oh Oh
[SHK] Where is this rash and most unfortunate man
[SHK] That 's he that was Othello here I am
[SHK] Where is that viper bring the villain forth
[SHK] I look down towards his feet but that 's a fable
[SHK] If that thou best a devil I can not kill thee
[SHK] Wrench his sword from him
[SHK] I bleed sir but not kill 'd
[SHK] I am not sorry neither I'ld have thee live
[SHK] For in my sense 't is happiness to die
[SHK] O thou Othello thou wert once so good
[SHK] Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave
[SHK] What shall be said to thee
[SHK] Why any thing
[SHK] An honourable murderer if you will
[SHK] For nought I did in hate but all in honour
[SHK] This wretch hath part confess 'd his villany
[SHK] Did you and he consent in Cassio 's death
[SHK] Ay
[SHK] Dear general I never gave you cause
[SHK] I do believe it and I ask your pardon
[SHK] Will you I pray demand that demi-devil
[SHK] Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
[SHK] Demand me nothing what you know you know
[SHK] From this time forth I never will speak word
[SHK] What not to pray
[SHK] Torments will ope your lips
[SHK] Well thou dost best
[SHK] Sir you shall understand what hath befall'n
[SHK] Which as I think you know not Here is a letter
[SHK] Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo
[SHK] And here another the one of them imports
[SHK] The death of Cassio to be undertook
[SHK] By Roderigo
[SHK] O villain
[SHK] Most heathenish and most gross
[SHK] Now here 's another discontented paper
[SHK] Found in his pocket too and this it seems
[SHK] Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
[SHK] But that belike Iago in the interim
[SHK] Came in and satisfied him
[SHK] O the pernicious caitiff
[SHK] How came you Cassio by that handkerchief
[SHK] That was my wife 's
[SHK] I found it in my chamber
[SHK] And he himself confess 'd but even now
[SHK] That there he dropp 'd it for a special purpose
[SHK] Which wrought to his desire
[SHK] O fool fool fool
[SHK] There is besides in Roderigo 's letter
[SHK] How he upbraids Iago that he made him
[SHK] Brave me upon the watch whereon it came
[SHK] That I was cast and even but now he spake
[SHK] After long seeming dead Iago hurt him
[SHK] Iago set him on
[SHK] You must forsake this room and go with us
[SHK] Your power and your command is taken off
[SHK] And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave
[SHK] If there be any cunning cruelty
[SHK] That can torment him much and hold him long
[SHK] It shall be his You shall close prisoner rest
[SHK] Till that the nature of your fault be known
[SHK] To the Venetian state Come bring him away
[SHK] Soft you a word or two before you go
[SHK] I have done the state some service and they know't
[SHK] No more of that I pray you in your letters
[SHK] When you shall these unlucky deeds relate
[SHK] Speak of me as I am nothing extenuate
[SHK] Nor set down aught in malice then must you speak
[SHK] Of one that loved not wisely but too well
[SHK] Of one not easily jealous but being wrought
[SHK] Perplex 'd in the extreme of one whose hand
[SHK] Like the base Indian threw a pearl away
[SHK] Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
[SHK] Albeit unused to the melting mood
[SHK] Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
[SHK] Their medicinal gum Set you down this
[SHK] And say besides that in Aleppo once
[SHK] Where a malignant and a turban 'd Turk
[SHK] Beat a Venetian and traduced the state
[SHK] I took by the throat the circumcised dog
[SHK] And smote him thus
[SHK] O bloody period
[SHK] All that 's spoke is marr 'd
[SHK] I kiss 'd thee ere I kill 'd thee no way but this
[SHK] Killing myself to die upon a kiss
[SHK] This did I fear but thought he had no weapon
[SHK] For he was great of heart
[SHK] More fell than anguish hunger or the sea
[SHK] Look on the tragic loading of this bed
[SHK] This is thy work the object poisons sight
[SHK] Let it be hid Gratiano keep the house
[SHK] And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor
[SHK] For they succeed on you To you lord governor
[SHK] Remains the censure of this hellish villain
[SHK] The time the place the torture O enforce it
[SHK] Myself will straight aboard and to the state
[SHK] This heavy act with heavy heart relate
[SHK] Two households both alike in dignity
[SHK] In fair Verona where we lay our scene
[SHK] From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
[SHK] Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
[SHK] From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
[SHK] A pair of star-cross 'd lovers take their life
[SHK] Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
[SHK] Do with their death bury their parents strife
[SHK] The fearful passage of their death-mark 'd love
[SHK] And the continuance of their parents rage
[SHK] Which but their children 's end nought could remove
[SHK] Is now the two hours traffic of our stage
[SHK] The which if you with patient ears attend
[SHK] What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
[SHK] Gregory o my word we 'll not carry coals
[SHK] No for then we should be colliers
[SHK] I mean an we be in choler we 'll draw
[SHK] Ay while you live draw your neck out o the collar
[SHK] I strike quickly being moved
[SHK] But thou art not quickly moved to strike
[SHK] A dog of the house of Montague moves me
[SHK] To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand
[SHK] therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st away
[SHK] A dog of that house shall move me to stand I will
[SHK] take the wall of any man or maid of Montague 's
[SHK] That shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes
[SHK] to the wall
[SHK] True and therefore women being the weaker vessels
[SHK] are ever thrust to the wall therefore I will push
[SHK] Montague 's men from the wall and thrust his maids
[SHK] to the wall
[SHK] The quarrel is between our masters and us their men
[SHK] 'T is all one I will show myself a tyrant when I
[SHK] have fought with the men I will be cruel with the
[SHK] maids and cut off their heads
[SHK] The heads of the maids
[SHK] Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads
[SHK] take it in what sense thou wilt
[SHK] They must take it in sense that feel it
[SHK] Me they shall feel while I am able to stand and
[SHK] 't is known I am a pretty piece of flesh
[SHK] 'T is well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou
[SHK] hadst been poor John Draw thy tool here comes
[SHK] two of the house of the Montagues
[SHK] My naked weapon is out quarrel I will back thee
[SHK] How turn thy back and run
[SHK] Fear me not
[SHK] No marry I fear thee
[SHK] Let us take the law of our sides let them begin
[SHK] I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as
[SHK] they list
[SHK] Nay as they dare I will bite my thumb at them
[SHK] which is a disgrace to them if they bear it
[SHK] Do you bite your thumb at us sir
[SHK] I do bite my thumb sir
[SHK] Do you bite your thumb at us sir
[SHK] ay
[SHK] No
[SHK] No sir I do not bite my thumb at you sir but I
[SHK] bite my thumb sir
[SHK] Do you quarrel sir
[SHK] Quarrel sir no sir
[SHK] If you do sir I am for you I serve as good a man as you
[SHK] No better
[SHK] Well sir
[SHK] Say 'better here comes one of my master 's kinsmen
[SHK] Yes better sir
[SHK] You lie
[SHK] Draw if you be men Gregory remember thy swashing blow
[SHK] Part fools
[SHK] Put up your swords you know not what you do
[SHK] What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
[SHK] Turn thee Benvolio look upon thy death
[SHK] I do but keep the peace put up thy sword
[SHK] Or manage it to part these men with me
[SHK] What drawn and talk of peace I hate the word
[SHK] As I hate hell all Montagues and thee
[SHK] Have at thee coward
[SHK] Clubs bills and partisans strike beat them down
[SHK] Down with the Capulets down with the Montagues
[SHK] What noise is this Give me my long sword ho
[SHK] A crutch a crutch why call you for a sword
[SHK] My sword I say Old Montague is come
[SHK] And flourishes his blade in spite of me
[SHK] Thou villain Capulet -- Hold me not let me go
[SHK] Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe
[SHK] Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
[SHK] Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel --
[SHK] Will they not hear What ho you men you beasts
[SHK] That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
[SHK] With purple fountains issuing from your veins
[SHK] On pain of torture from those bloody hands
[SHK] Throw your mistemper 'd weapons to the ground
[SHK] And hear the sentence of your moved prince
[SHK] Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
[SHK] By thee old Capulet and Montague
[SHK] Have thrice disturb 'd the quiet of our streets
[SHK] And made Verona 's ancient citizens
[SHK] Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
[SHK] To wield old partisans in hands as old
[SHK] Canker 'd with peace to part your canker 'd hate
[SHK] If ever you disturb our streets again
[SHK] Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
[SHK] For this time all the rest depart away
[SHK] You Capulet shall go along with me
[SHK] And Montague come you this afternoon
[SHK] To know our further pleasure in this case
[SHK] To old Free-town our common judgment-place
[SHK] Once more on pain of death all men depart
[SHK] Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
[SHK] Speak nephew were you by when it began
[SHK] Here were the servants of your adversary
[SHK] And yours close fighting ere I did approach
[SHK] I drew to part them in the instant came
[SHK] The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared
[SHK] Which as he breathed defiance to my ears
[SHK] He swung about his head and cut the winds
[SHK] Who nothing hurt withal hiss 'd him in scorn
[SHK] While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
[SHK] Came more and more and fought on part and part
[SHK] Till the prince came who parted either part
[SHK] O where is Romeo saw you him to-day
[SHK] Right glad I am he was not at this fray
[SHK] Madam an hour before the worshipp 'd sun
[SHK] Peer 'd forth the golden window of the east
[SHK] A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
[SHK] Where underneath the grove of sycamore
[SHK] That westward rooteth from the city 's side
[SHK] So early walking did I see your son
[SHK] Towards him I made but he was ware of me
[SHK] And stole into the covert of the wood
[SHK] I measuring his affections by my own
[SHK] That most are busied when they 're most alone
[SHK] Pursued my humour not pursuing his
[SHK] And gladly shunn 'd who gladly fled from me
[SHK] Many a morning hath he there been seen
[SHK] With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
[SHK] Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
[SHK] But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
[SHK] Should in the furthest east begin to draw
[SHK] The shady curtains from Aurora 's bed
[SHK] Away from the light steals home my heavy son
[SHK] And private in his chamber pens himself
[SHK] Shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
[SHK] And makes himself an artificial night
[SHK] Black and portentous must this humour prove
[SHK] Unless good counsel may the cause remove
[SHK] My noble uncle do you know the cause
[SHK] I neither know it nor can learn of him
[SHK] Have you importuned him by any means
[SHK] Both by myself and many other friends
[SHK] But he his own affections counsellor
[SHK] Is to himself -- I will not say how true --
[SHK] But to himself so secret and so close
[SHK] So far from sounding and discovery
[SHK] As is the bud bit with an envious worm
[SHK] Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
[SHK] Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
[SHK] Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
[SHK] We would as willingly give cure as know
[SHK] See where he comes so please you step aside
[SHK] I 'll know his grievance or be much denied
[SHK] I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
[SHK] To hear true shrift Come madam let 's away
[SHK] Good-morrow cousin
[SHK] Is the day so young
[SHK] But new struck nine
[SHK] Ay me sad hours seem long
[SHK] Was that my father that went hence so fast
[SHK] It was What sadness lengthens Romeo 's hours
[SHK] Not having that which having makes them short
[SHK] In love
[SHK] Out --
[SHK] Of love
[SHK] Out of her favour where I am in love
[SHK] Alas that love so gentle in his view
[SHK] Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
[SHK] Alas that love whose view is muffled still
[SHK] Should without eyes see pathways to his will
[SHK] Where shall we dine O me What fray was here
[SHK] Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
[SHK] Here 's much to do with hate but more with love
[SHK] Why then O brawling love O loving hate
[SHK] O any thing of nothing first create
[SHK] O heavy lightness serious vanity
[SHK] Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms
[SHK] Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire
[SHK] sick health
[SHK] Still-waking sleep that is not what it is
[SHK] This love feel I that feel no love in this
[SHK] Dost thou not laugh
[SHK] No coz I rather weep
[SHK] Good heart at what
[SHK] At thy good heart 's oppression
[SHK] Why such is love 's transgression
[SHK] Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
[SHK] Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
[SHK] With more of thine this love that thou hast shown
[SHK] Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
[SHK] Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
[SHK] Being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
[SHK] Being vex 'd a sea nourish 'd with lovers tears
[SHK] What is it else a madness most discreet
[SHK] A choking gall and a preserving sweet
[SHK] Farewell my coz
[SHK] Soft I will go along
[SHK] An if you leave me so you do me wrong
[SHK] Tut I have lost myself I am not here
[SHK] This is not Romeo he 's some other where
[SHK] Tell me in sadness who is that you love
[SHK] What shall I groan and tell thee
[SHK] Groan why no
[SHK] But sadly tell me who
[SHK] Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
[SHK] Ah word ill urged to one that is so ill
[SHK] In sadness cousin I do love a woman
[SHK] I aim 'd so near when I supposed you loved
[SHK] A right good mark-man And she 's fair I love
[SHK] A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
[SHK] Well in that hit you miss she 'll not be hit
[SHK] With Cupid 's arrow she hath Dian 's wit
[SHK] And in strong proof of chastity well arm 'd
[SHK] From love 's weak childish bow she lives unharm 'd
[SHK] She will not stay the siege of loving terms
[SHK] Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
[SHK] Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold
[SHK] O she is rich in beauty only poor
[SHK] That when she dies with beauty dies her store
[SHK] Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
[SHK] She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
[SHK] For beauty starved with her severity
[SHK] Cuts beauty off from all posterity
[SHK] She is too fair too wise wisely too fair
[SHK] To merit bliss by making me despair
[SHK] She hath forsworn to love and in that vow
[SHK] Do I live dead that live to tell it now
[SHK] Be ruled by me forget to think of her
[SHK] O teach me how I should forget to think
[SHK] By giving liberty unto thine eyes
[SHK] Examine other beauties
[SHK] 'T is the way
[SHK] To call hers exquisite in question more
[SHK] These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
[SHK] Being black put us in mind they hide the fair
[SHK] He that is strucken blind can not forget
[SHK] The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
[SHK] Show me a mistress that is passing fair
[SHK] What doth her beauty serve but as a note
[SHK] Where I may read who pass 'd that passing fair
[SHK] Farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
[SHK] I 'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt
[SHK] But Montague is bound as well as I
[SHK] In penalty alike and 't is not hard I think
[SHK] For men so old as we to keep the peace
[SHK] Of honourable reckoning are you both
[SHK] And pity 't is you lived at odds so long
[SHK] But now my lord what say you to my suit
[SHK] But saying o'er what I have said before
[SHK] My child is yet a stranger in the world
[SHK] She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
[SHK] Let two more summers wither in their pride
[SHK] Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
[SHK] Younger than she are happy mothers made
[SHK] And too soon marr 'd are those so early made
[SHK] The earth hath swallow 'd all my hopes but she
[SHK] She is the hopeful lady of my earth
[SHK] But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
[SHK] My will to her consent is but a part
[SHK] An she agree within her scope of choice
[SHK] Lies my consent and fair according voice
[SHK] This night I hold an old accustom 'd feast
[SHK] Whereto I have invited many a guest
[SHK] Such as I love and you among the store
[SHK] One more most welcome makes my number more
[SHK] At my poor house look to behold this night
[SHK] Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light
[SHK] Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
[SHK] When well-apparell 'd April on the heel
[SHK] Of limping winter treads even such delight
[SHK] Among fresh female buds shall you this night
[SHK] Inherit at my house hear all all see
[SHK] And like her most whose merit most shall be
[SHK] Which on more view of many mine being one
[SHK] May stand in number though in reckoning none
[SHK] Come go with me
[SHK] Go sirrah trudge about
[SHK] Through fair Verona find those persons out
[SHK] Whose names are written there and to them say
[SHK] My house and welcome on their pleasure stay
[SHK] Find them out whose names are written here It is
[SHK] written that the shoemaker should meddle with his
[SHK] yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with
[SHK] his pencil and the painter with his nets but I am
[SHK] sent to find those persons whose names are here
[SHK] writ and can never find what names the writing
[SHK] person hath here writ I must to the learned. -- In good time
[SHK] Tut man one fire burns out another 's burning
[SHK] One pain is lessen 'd by another 's anguish
[SHK] Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
[SHK] One desperate grief cures with another 's languish
[SHK] Take thou some new infection to thy eye
[SHK] And the rank poison of the old will die
[SHK] Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that
[SHK] For what I pray thee
[SHK] For your broken shin
[SHK] Why Romeo art thou mad
[SHK] Not mad but bound more than a mad-man is
[SHK] Shut up in prison kept without my food
[SHK] Whipp 'd and tormented and -- God-den good fellow
[SHK] God gi god-den I pray sir can you read
[SHK] Ay mine own fortune in my misery
[SHK] Perhaps you have learned it without book but I
[SHK] pray can you read any thing you see
[SHK] Ay if I know the letters and the language
[SHK] Ye say honestly rest you merry
[SHK] Stay fellow I can read
[SHK] 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters
[SHK] County Anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady
[SHK] widow of Vitravio Signior Placentio and his lovely
[SHK] nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine mine
[SHK] uncle Capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece
[SHK] Rosaline Livia Signior Valentio and his cousin
[SHK] Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena A fair
[SHK] assembly whither should they come
[SHK] Up
[SHK] Whither
[SHK] To supper to our house
[SHK] Whose house
[SHK] My master 's
[SHK] Indeed I should have ask 'd you that before
[SHK] Now I 'll tell you without asking my master is the
[SHK] great rich Capulet and if you be not of the house
[SHK] of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine
[SHK] Rest you merry
[SHK] At this same ancient feast of Capulet 's
[SHK] Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest
[SHK] With all the admired beauties of Verona
[SHK] Go thither and with unattainted eye
[SHK] Compare her face with some that I shall show
[SHK] And I will make thee think thy swan a crow
[SHK] When the devout religion of mine eye
[SHK] Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires
[SHK] And these who often drown 'd could never die
[SHK] Transparent heretics be burnt for liars
[SHK] One fairer than my love the all-seeing sun
[SHK] Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun
[SHK] Tut you saw her fair none else being by
[SHK] Herself poised with herself in either eye
[SHK] But in that crystal scales let there be weigh 'd
[SHK] Your lady 's love against some other maid
[SHK] That I will show you shining at this feast
[SHK] And she shall scant show well that now shows best
[SHK] I 'll go along no such sight to be shown
[SHK] But to rejoice in splendor of mine own
[SHK] Nurse where 's my daughter call her forth to me
[SHK] Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old
[SHK] I bade her come What lamb what ladybird
[SHK] God forbid Where 's this girl What Juliet
[SHK] How now who calls
[SHK] Your mother
[SHK] Madam I am here
[SHK] What is your will
[SHK] This is the matter -- Nurse give leave awhile
[SHK] We must talk in secret -- nurse come back again
[SHK] I have remember 'd me thou 's hear our counsel
[SHK] Thou know'st my daughter 's of a pretty age
[SHK] Faith I can tell her age unto an hour
[SHK] She 's not fourteen
[SHK] I 'll lay fourteen of my teeth --
[SHK] And yet to my teeth be it spoken I have but four --
[SHK] She is not fourteen How long is it now
[SHK] To Lammas-tide
[SHK] A fortnight and odd days
[SHK] Even or odd of all days in the year
[SHK] Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen
[SHK] Susan and she -- God rest all Christian souls --
[SHK] Were of an age well Susan is with God
[SHK] She was too good for me but as I said
[SHK] On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen
[SHK] That shall she marry I remember it well
[SHK] 'T is since the earthquake now eleven years
[SHK] And she was wean 'd -- I never shall forget it --
[SHK] Of all the days of the year upon that day
[SHK] For I had then laid wormwood to my dug
[SHK] Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall
[SHK] My lord and you were then at Mantua --
[SHK] Nay I do bear a brain -- but as I said
[SHK] When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
[SHK] Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
[SHK] To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
[SHK] Shake quoth the dove-house 't was no need I trow
[SHK] To bid me trudge
[SHK] And since that time it is eleven years
[SHK] For then she could stand alone nay by the rood
[SHK] She could have run and waddled all about
[SHK] For even the day before she broke her brow
[SHK] And then my husband -- God be with his soul
[SHK] A was a merry man -- took up the child
[SHK] 'Yea quoth he 'dost thou fall upon thy face
[SHK] Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit
[SHK] Wilt thou not Jule and by my holidame
[SHK] The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay
[SHK] To see now how a jest shall come about
[SHK] I warrant an I should live a thousand years
[SHK] I never should forget it 'Wilt thou not Jule quoth he
[SHK] And pretty fool it stinted and said 'Ay
[SHK] Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace
[SHK] Yes madam yet I can not choose but laugh
[SHK] To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay
[SHK] And yet I warrant it had upon its brow
[SHK] A bump as big as a young cockerel 's stone
[SHK] A parlous knock and it cried bitterly
[SHK] 'Yea quoth my husband 'fall'st upon thy face
[SHK] Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
[SHK] Wilt thou not Jule it stinted and said 'Ay
[SHK] And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I
[SHK] Peace I have done God mark thee to his grace
[SHK] Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed
[SHK] An I might live to see thee married once
[SHK] I have my wish
[SHK] Marry that 'marry is the very theme
[SHK] I came to talk of Tell me daughter Juliet
[SHK] How stands your disposition to be married
[SHK] It is an honour that I dream not of
[SHK] An honour were not I thine only nurse
[SHK] I would say thou hadst suck 'd wisdom from thy teat
[SHK] Well think of marriage now younger than you
[SHK] Here in Verona ladies of esteem
[SHK] Are made already mothers by my count
[SHK] I was your mother much upon these years
[SHK] That you are now a maid Thus then in brief
[SHK] The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
[SHK] A man young lady lady such a man
[SHK] As all the world -- why he 's a man of wax
[SHK] Verona 's summer hath not such a flower
[SHK] Nay he 's a flower in faith a very flower
[SHK] What say you can you love the gentleman
[SHK] This night you shall behold him at our feast
[SHK] Read o'er the volume of young Paris face
[SHK] And find delight writ there with beauty 's pen
[SHK] Examine every married lineament
[SHK] And see how one another lends content
[SHK] And what obscured in this fair volume lies
[SHK] Find written in the margent of his eyes
[SHK] This precious book of love this unbound lover
[SHK] To beautify him only lacks a cover
[SHK] The fish lives in the sea and 't is much pride
[SHK] For fair without the fair within to hide
[SHK] That book in many 's eyes doth share the glory
[SHK] That in gold clasps locks in the golden story
[SHK] So shall you share all that he doth possess
[SHK] By having him making yourself no less
[SHK] No less nay bigger women grow by men
[SHK] Speak briefly can you like of Paris love
[SHK] I 'll look to like if looking liking move
[SHK] But no more deep will I endart mine eye
[SHK] Than your consent gives strength to make it fly
[SHK] Madam the guests are come supper served up you
[SHK] called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in
[SHK] the pantry and every thing in extremity I must
[SHK] hence to wait I beseech you follow straight
[SHK] We follow thee
[SHK] Juliet the county stays
[SHK] Go girl seek happy nights to happy days
[SHK] What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
[SHK] Or shall we on without a apology
[SHK] The date is out of such prolixity
[SHK] We 'll have no Cupid hoodwink 'd with a scarf
[SHK] Bearing a Tartar 's painted bow of lath
[SHK] Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper
[SHK] Nor no without-book prologue faintly spoke
[SHK] After the prompter for our entrance
[SHK] But let them measure us by what they will
[SHK] We 'll measure them a measure and be gone
[SHK] Give me a torch I am not for this ambling
[SHK] Being but heavy I will bear the light
[SHK] Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance
[SHK] Not I believe me you have dancing shoes
[SHK] With nimble soles I have a soul of lead
[SHK] So stakes me to the ground I can not move
[SHK] You are a lover borrow Cupid 's wings
[SHK] And soar with them above a common bound
[SHK] I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
[SHK] To soar with his light feathers and so bound
[SHK] I can not bound a pitch above dull woe
[SHK] Under love 's heavy burden do I sink
[SHK] And to sink in it should you burden love
[SHK] Too great oppression for a tender thing
[SHK] Is love a tender thing it is too rough
[SHK] Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
[SHK] If love be rough with you be rough with love
[SHK] Prick love for pricking and you beat love down
[SHK] Give me a case to put my visage in
[SHK] A visor for a visor what care I
[SHK] What curious eye doth quote deformities
[SHK] Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
[SHK] Come knock and enter and no sooner in
[SHK] But every man betake him to his legs
[SHK] A torch for me let wantons light of heart
[SHK] Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
[SHK] For I am proverb 'd with a grandsire phrase
[SHK] I 'll be a candle-holder and look on
[SHK] The game was ne'er so fair and I am done
[SHK] Tut dun 's the mouse the constable 's own word
[SHK] If thou art dun we 'll draw thee from the mire
[SHK] Of this sir-reverence love wherein thou stick'st
[SHK] Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho
[SHK] Nay that 's not so
[SHK] I mean sir in delay
[SHK] We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
[SHK] Take our good meaning for our judgment sits
[SHK] Five times in that ere once in our five wits
[SHK] And we mean well in going to this mask
[SHK] But 't is no wit to go
[SHK] Why may one ask
[SHK] I dream 'd a dream to-night
[SHK] And so did I
[SHK] Well what was yours
[SHK] That dreamers often lie
[SHK] In bed asleep while they do dream things true
[SHK] O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
[SHK] She is the fairies midwife and she comes
[SHK] In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
[SHK] On the fore-finger of an alderman
[SHK] Drawn with a team of little atomies
[SHK] Athwart men 's noses as they lie asleep
[SHK] Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders legs
[SHK] The cover of the wings of grasshoppers
[SHK] The traces of the smallest spider 's web
[SHK] The collars of the moonshine 's watery beams
[SHK] Her whip of cricket 's bone the lash of film
[SHK] Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat
[SHK] Not so big as a round little worm
[SHK] Prick 'd from the lazy finger of a maid
[SHK] Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
[SHK] Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
[SHK] Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
[SHK] And in this state she gallops night by night
[SHK] Through lovers brains and then they dream of love
[SHK] O'er courtiers knees that dream on court'sies straight
[SHK] O'er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
[SHK] O'er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
[SHK] Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
[SHK] Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
[SHK] Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier 's nose
[SHK] And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
[SHK] And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig 's tail
[SHK] Tickling a parson 's nose as a lies asleep
[SHK] Then dreams he of another benefice
[SHK] Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck
[SHK] And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
[SHK] Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades
[SHK] Of healths five-fathom deep and then anon
[SHK] Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
[SHK] And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
[SHK] And sleeps again This is that very Mab
[SHK] That plats the manes of horses in the night
[SHK] And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
[SHK] Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
[SHK] This is the hag when maids lie on their backs
[SHK] That presses them and learns them first to bear
[SHK] Making them women of good carriage
[SHK] This is she --
[SHK] Peace peace Mercutio peace
[SHK] Thou talk'st of nothing
[SHK] True I talk of dreams
[SHK] Which are the children of an idle brain
[SHK] Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
[SHK] Which is as thin of substance as the air
[SHK] And more inconstant than the wind who wooes
[SHK] Even now the frozen bosom of the north
[SHK] And being anger 'd puffs away from thence
[SHK] Turning his face to the dew-dropping south
[SHK] This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
[SHK] Supper is done and we shall come too late
[SHK] I fear too early for my mind misgives
[SHK] Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
[SHK] Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
[SHK] With this night 's revels and expire the term
[SHK] Of a despised life closed in my breast
[SHK] By some vile forfeit of untimely death
[SHK] But He that hath the steerage of my course
[SHK] Direct my sail On lusty gentlemen
[SHK] Strike drum
[SHK] Where 's Potpan that he helps not to take away He
[SHK] shift a trencher he scrape a trencher
[SHK] When good manners shall lie all in one or two men 's
[SHK] hands and they unwashed too 't is a foul thing
[SHK] Away with the joint-stools remove the
[SHK] court-cupboard look to the plate Good thou save
[SHK] me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let
[SHK] the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell
[SHK] Antony and Potpan

[SHK] For you and I are past our dancing days
[SHK] How long is't now since last yourself and I
[SHK] Were in a mask
[SHK] By r lady thirty years
[SHK] What man 't is not so much 't is not so much
[SHK] 'T is since the nuptials of Lucentio
[SHK] Come pentecost as quickly as it will
[SHK] Some five and twenty years and then we mask 'd
[SHK] 'T is more 't is more his son is elder sir
[SHK] His son is thirty
[SHK] Will you tell me that
[SHK] His son was but a ward two years ago
[SHK] enrich the hand
[SHK] Of yonder knight
[SHK] I know not sir
[SHK] O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
[SHK] It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
[SHK] Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope 's ear
[SHK] Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
[SHK] So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
[SHK] As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows
[SHK] The measure done I 'll watch her place of stand
[SHK] And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
[SHK] Did my heart love till now forswear it sight
[SHK] For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night
[SHK] This by his voice should be a Montague
[SHK] Fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave
[SHK] Come hither cover 'd with an antic face
[SHK] To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
[SHK] Now by the stock and honour of my kin
[SHK] To strike him dead I hold it not a sin
[SHK] Why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so
[SHK] Uncle this is a Montague our foe
[SHK] A villain that is hither come in spite
[SHK] To scorn at our solemnity this night
[SHK] Young Romeo is it
[SHK] 'T is he that villain Romeo
[SHK] Content thee gentle coz let him alone
[SHK] He bears him like a portly gentleman
[SHK] And to say truth Verona brags of him
[SHK] To be a virtuous and well-govern 'd youth
[SHK] I would not for the wealth of all the town
[SHK] Here in my house do him disparagement
[SHK] Therefore be patient take no note of him
[SHK] It is my will the which if thou respect
[SHK] Show a fair presence and put off these frowns
[SHK] And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast
[SHK] It fits when such a villain is a guest
[SHK] I 'll not endure him
[SHK] He shall be endured
[SHK] What goodman boy I say he shall go to
[SHK] Am I the master here or you go to
[SHK] You 'll not endure him God shall mend my soul
[SHK] You 'll make a mutiny among my guests
[SHK] You will set cock-a-hoop you 'll be the man
[SHK] Why uncle 't is a shame

[SHK] Well said my hearts You are a princox go
[SHK] Be quiet or -- More light more light For shame
[SHK] I 'll make you quiet What cheerly my hearts
[SHK] Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
[SHK] Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
[SHK] I will withdraw but this intrusion shall
[SHK] Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
[SHK] This holy shrine the gentle fine is this
[SHK] My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
[SHK] To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
[SHK] Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
[SHK] Which mannerly devotion shows in this
[SHK] For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
[SHK] And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
[SHK] Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
[SHK] Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
[SHK] O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
[SHK] They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
[SHK] Saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
[SHK] Then move not while my prayer 's effect I take
[SHK] Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
[SHK] Then have my lips the sin that they have took
[SHK] Sin from thy lips O trespass sweetly urged
[SHK] Give me my sin again
[SHK] You kiss by the book
[SHK] Madam your mother craves a word with you
[SHK] What is her mother
[SHK] Marry bachelor
[SHK] Her mother is the lady of the house
[SHK] And a good lady and a wise and virtuous
[SHK] I nursed her daughter that you talk 'd withal
[SHK] I tell you he that can lay hold of her
[SHK] Shall have the chinks
[SHK] Is she a Capulet
[SHK] O dear account my life is my foe 's debt
[SHK] Away begone the sport is at the best
[SHK] Ay so I fear the more is my unrest
[SHK] Nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone
[SHK] We have a trifling foolish banquet towards
[SHK] Is it e'en so why then I thank you all
[SHK] I thank you honest gentlemen good night
[SHK] More torches here Come on then let 's to bed
[SHK] Ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late
[SHK] I 'll to my rest
[SHK] Come hither nurse What is yond gentleman
[SHK] The son and heir of old Tiberio
[SHK] What 's he that now is going out of door
[SHK] Marry that I think be young Petrucio
[SHK] What 's he that follows there that would not dance
[SHK] I know not
[SHK] Go ask his name if he be married
[SHK] My grave is like to be my wedding bed
[SHK] His name is Romeo and a Montague
[SHK] The only son of your great enemy
[SHK] My only love sprung from my only hate
[SHK] Too early seen unknown and known too late
[SHK] Prodigious birth of love it is to me
[SHK] That I must love a loathed enemy
[SHK] What 's this what 's this
[SHK] A rhyme I learn 'd even now
[SHK] Of one I danced withal
[SHK] Anon anon
[SHK] Come let 's away the strangers all are gone
[SHK] Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie
[SHK] And young affection gapes to be his heir
[SHK] That fair for which love groan 'd for and would die
[SHK] With tender Juliet match 'd is now not fair
[SHK] Now Romeo is beloved and loves again
[SHK] Alike betwitched by the charm of looks
[SHK] But to his foe supposed he must complain
[SHK] And she steal love 's sweet bait from fearful hooks
[SHK] Being held a foe he may not have access
[SHK] To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
[SHK] And she as much in love her means much less
[SHK] To meet her new-beloved any where
[SHK] But passion lends them power time means to meet
[SHK] Tempering extremities with extreme sweet
[SHK] Can I go forward when my heart is here
[SHK] Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
[SHK] Romeo my cousin Romeo
[SHK] He is wise
[SHK] And on my lie hath stol'n him home to bed
[SHK] He ran this way and leap 'd this orchard wall
[SHK] Call good Mercutio
[SHK] Nay I 'll conjure too
[SHK] Romeo humours madman passion lover
[SHK] Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
[SHK] Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
[SHK] Cry but 'Ay me pronounce but 'love and 'dove
[SHK] Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
[SHK] One nick-name for her purblind son and heir
[SHK] Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim
[SHK] When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid
[SHK] He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
[SHK] The ape is dead and I must conjure him
[SHK] I conjure thee by Rosaline 's bright eyes
[SHK] By her high forehead and her scarlet lip
[SHK] By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
[SHK] And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
[SHK] That in thy likeness thou appear to us
[SHK] And if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
[SHK] This can not anger him 'twould anger him
[SHK] To raise a spirit in his mistress circle
[SHK] Of some strange nature letting it there stand
[SHK] Till she had laid it and conjured it down
[SHK] That were some spite my invocation
[SHK] Is fair and honest and in his mistress name
[SHK] I conjure only but to raise up him
[SHK] Come he hath hid himself among these trees
[SHK] To be consorted with the humorous night
[SHK] Blind is his love and best befits the dark
[SHK] If love be blind love can not hit the mark
[SHK] Now will he sit under a medlar tree
[SHK] And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
[SHK] As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
[SHK] Romeo that she were O that she were
[SHK] An open et caetera thou a poperin pear
[SHK] Romeo good night I 'll to my truckle-bed
[SHK] This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep
[SHK] Come shall we go
[SHK] Go then for 't is in vain
[SHK] To seek him here that means not to be found
[SHK] He jests at scars that never felt a wound
[SHK] But soft what light through yonder window breaks
[SHK] It is the east and Juliet is the sun
[SHK] Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
[SHK] Who is already sick and pale with grief
[SHK] That thou her maid art far more fair than she
[SHK] Be not her maid since she is envious
[SHK] Her vestal livery is but sick and green
[SHK] And none but fools do wear it cast it off
[SHK] It is my lady O it is my love
[SHK] O that she knew she were
[SHK] She speaks yet she says nothing what of that
[SHK] Her eye discourses I will answer it
[SHK] I am too bold 't is not to me she speaks
[SHK] Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
[SHK] Having some business do entreat her eyes
[SHK] To twinkle in their spheres till they return
[SHK] What if her eyes were there they in her head
[SHK] The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
[SHK] As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
[SHK] Would through the airy region stream so bright
[SHK] That birds would sing and think it were not night
[SHK] See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
[SHK] O that I were a glove upon that hand
[SHK] That I might touch that cheek
[SHK] Ay me
[SHK] She speaks
[SHK] O speak again bright angel for thou art
[SHK] As glorious to this night being o'er my head
[SHK] As is a winged messenger of heaven
[SHK] Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
[SHK] Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
[SHK] When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
[SHK] And sails upon the bosom of the air
[SHK] O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
[SHK] Deny thy father and refuse thy name
[SHK] Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
[SHK] And I 'll no longer be a Capulet
[SHK] 'T is but thy name that is my enemy
[SHK] Thou art thyself though not a Montague
[SHK] What 's Montague it is nor hand nor foot
[SHK] Nor arm nor face nor any other part
[SHK] Belonging to a man O be some other name
[SHK] What 's in a name that which we call a rose
[SHK] By any other name would smell as sweet
[SHK] So Romeo would were he not Romeo call 'd
[SHK] Retain that dear perfection which he owes
[SHK] Without that title Romeo doff thy name
[SHK] And for that name which is no part of thee
[SHK] Take all myself
[SHK] I take thee at thy word
[SHK] Call me but love and I 'll be new baptized
[SHK] Henceforth I never will be Romeo
[SHK] What man art thou that thus bescreen 'd in night
[SHK] So stumblest on my counsel
[SHK] By a name
[SHK] I know not how to tell thee who I am
[SHK] My name dear saint is hateful to myself
[SHK] Because it is an enemy to thee
[SHK] Had I it written I would tear the word
[SHK] My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
[SHK] Of that tongue 's utterance yet I know the sound
[SHK] Art thou not Romeo and a Montague
[SHK] Neither fair saint if either thee dislike
[SHK] How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
[SHK] The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
[SHK] And the place death considering who thou art
[SHK] If any of my kinsmen find thee here
[SHK] With love 's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls
[SHK] For stony limits can not hold love out
[SHK] And what love can do that dares love attempt
[SHK] Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
[SHK] If they do see thee they will murder thee
[SHK] Alack there lies more peril in thine eye
[SHK] Than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
[SHK] And I am proof against their enmity
[SHK] I would not for the world they saw thee here
[SHK] I have night 's cloak to hide me from their sight
[SHK] And but thou love me let them find me here
[SHK] My life were better ended by their hate
[SHK] Than death prorogued wanting of thy love
[SHK] By whose direction found'st thou out this place
[SHK] By love who first did prompt me to inquire
[SHK] He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
[SHK] I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
[SHK] As that vast shore wash 'd with the farthest sea
[SHK] I would adventure for such merchandise
[SHK] Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face
[SHK] Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
[SHK] For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
[SHK] Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
[SHK] What I have spoke but farewell compliment
[SHK] Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say 'Ay
[SHK] And I will take thy word yet if thou swear'st
[SHK] Thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
[SHK] Then say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
[SHK] If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
[SHK] Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won
[SHK] I 'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay
[SHK] So thou wilt woo but else not for the world
[SHK] In truth fair Montague I am too fond
[SHK] And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light
[SHK] But trust me gentleman I 'll prove more true
[SHK] Than those that have more cunning to be strange
[SHK] I should have been more strange I must confess
[SHK] But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware
[SHK] My true love 's passion therefore pardon me
[SHK] And not impute this yielding to light love
[SHK] Which the dark night hath so discovered
[SHK] Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear
[SHK] That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops --
[SHK] O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
[SHK] That monthly changes in her circled orb
[SHK] Lest that thy love prove likewise variable
[SHK] What shall I swear by
[SHK] Do not swear at all
[SHK] Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
[SHK] Which is the god of my idolatry
[SHK] And I 'll believe thee
[SHK] If my heart 's dear love --
[SHK] Well do not swear although I joy in thee
[SHK] I have no joy of this contract to-night
[SHK] It is too rash too unadvised too sudden
[SHK] Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
[SHK] Ere one can say 'It lightens Sweet good night
[SHK] This bud of love by summer 's ripening breath
[SHK] May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
[SHK] Good night good night as sweet repose and rest
[SHK] Come to thy heart as that within my breast
[SHK] O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
[SHK] What satisfaction canst thou have to-night
[SHK] The exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine
[SHK] I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
[SHK] And yet I would it were to give again
[SHK] Wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love
[SHK] But to be frank and give it thee again
[SHK] And yet I wish but for the thing I have
[SHK] My bounty is as boundless as the sea
[SHK] My love as deep the more I give to thee
[SHK] The more I have for both are infinite
[SHK] I hear some noise within dear love adieu
[SHK] Anon good nurse Sweet Montague be true
[SHK] Stay but a little I will come again
[SHK] O blessed blessed night I am afeard
[SHK] Being in night all this is but a dream
[SHK] Too flattering-sweet to be substantial
[SHK] Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
[SHK] If that thy bent of love be honourable
[SHK] Thy purpose marriage send me word to-morrow
[SHK] By one that I 'll procure to come to thee
[SHK] Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
[SHK] And all my fortunes at thy foot I 'll lay
[SHK] And follow thee my lord throughout the world
[SHK] I come anon. -- But if thou mean'st not well
[SHK] I do beseech thee --
[SHK] By and by I come --
[SHK] To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
[SHK] To-morrow will I send
[SHK] So thrive my soul --
[SHK] A thousand times good night
[SHK] A thousand times the worse to want thy light
[SHK] Love goes toward love as schoolboys from
[SHK] their books
[SHK] But love from love toward school with heavy looks
[SHK] Hist Romeo hist O for a falconer 's voice
[SHK] To lure this tassel-gentle back again
[SHK] Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
[SHK] Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
[SHK] And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
[SHK] With repetition of my Romeo 's name
[SHK] It is my soul that calls upon my name
[SHK] How silver-sweet sound lovers tongues by night
[SHK] Like softest music to attending ears
[SHK] Romeo
[SHK] My dear
[SHK] At what o'clock to-morrow
[SHK] Shall I send to thee
[SHK] At the hour of nine
[SHK] I will not fail 't is twenty years till then
[SHK] I have forgot why I did call thee back
[SHK] Let me stand here till thou remember it
[SHK] I shall forget to have thee still stand there
[SHK] Remembering how I love thy company
[SHK] And I 'll still stay to have thee still forget
[SHK] Forgetting any other home but this
[SHK] 'T is almost morning I would have thee gone
[SHK] And yet no further than a wanton 's bird
[SHK] Who lets it hop a little from her hand
[SHK] Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
[SHK] And with a silk thread plucks it back again
[SHK] So loving-jealous of his liberty
[SHK] I would I were thy bird
[SHK] Sweet so would I
[SHK] Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
[SHK] Good night good night parting is such
[SHK] sweet sorrow
[SHK] That I shall say good night till it be morrow
[SHK] Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
[SHK] Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
[SHK] Hence will I to my ghostly father 's cell
[SHK] His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
[SHK] The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night
[SHK] Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
[SHK] And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
[SHK] From forth day 's path and Titan 's fiery wheels
[SHK] Now ere the sun advance his burning eye
[SHK] The day to cheer and night 's dank dew to dry
[SHK] I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
[SHK] With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers
[SHK] The earth that 's nature 's mother is her tomb
[SHK] What is her burying grave that is her womb
[SHK] And from her womb children of divers kind
[SHK] We sucking on her natural bosom find
[SHK] Many for many virtues excellent
[SHK] None but for some and yet all different
[SHK] O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
[SHK] In herbs plants stones and their true qualities
[SHK] For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
[SHK] But to the earth some special good doth give
[SHK] Nor aught so good but strain 'd from that fair use
[SHK] Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
[SHK] Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
[SHK] And vice sometimes by action dignified
[SHK] Within the infant rind of this small flower
[SHK] Poison hath residence and medicine power
[SHK] For this being smelt with that part cheers each part
[SHK] Being tasted slays all senses with the heart
[SHK] Two such opposed kings encamp them still
[SHK] In man as well as herbs grace and rude will
[SHK] And where the worser is predominant
[SHK] Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
[SHK] Good morrow father
[SHK] Benedicite
[SHK] What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
[SHK] Young son it argues a distemper 'd head
[SHK] So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
[SHK] Care keeps his watch in every old man 's eye
[SHK] And where care lodges sleep will never lie
[SHK] But where unbruised youth with unstuff 'd brain
[SHK] Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
[SHK] Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
[SHK] Thou art up-roused by some distemperature
[SHK] Or if not so then here I hit it right
[SHK] Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night
[SHK] That last is true the sweeter rest was mine
[SHK] God pardon sin wast thou with Rosaline
[SHK] With Rosaline my ghostly father no
[SHK] I have forgot that name and that name 's woe
[SHK] That 's my good son but where hast thou been then
[SHK] I 'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
[SHK] I have been feasting with mine enemy
[SHK] Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
[SHK] That 's by me wounded both our remedies
[SHK] Within thy help and holy physic lies
[SHK] I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
[SHK] My intercession likewise steads my foe
[SHK] Be plain good son and homely in thy drift
[SHK] Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
[SHK] Then plainly know my heart 's dear love is set
[SHK] On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
[SHK] As mine on hers so hers is set on mine
[SHK] And all combined save what thou must combine
[SHK] By holy marriage when and where and how
[SHK] We met we woo 'd and made exchange of vow
[SHK] I 'll tell thee as we pass but this I pray
[SHK] That thou consent to marry us to-day
[SHK] Holy Saint Francis what a change is here
[SHK] Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
[SHK] So soon forsaken young men 's love then lies
[SHK] Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
[SHK] Jesu Maria what a deal of brine
[SHK] Hath wash 'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
[SHK] How much salt water thrown away in waste
[SHK] To season love that of it doth not taste
[SHK] The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
[SHK] Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
[SHK] Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
[SHK] Of an old tear that is not wash 'd off yet
[SHK] If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine
[SHK] Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
[SHK] And art thou changed pronounce this sentence then
[SHK] Women may fall when there 's no strength in men
[SHK] Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline
[SHK] For doting not for loving pupil mine
[SHK] And bad'st me bury love
[SHK] Not in a grave
[SHK] To lay one in another out to have
[SHK] I pray thee chide not she whom I love now
[SHK] Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
[SHK] The other did not so
[SHK] O she knew well
[SHK] Thy love did read by rote and could not spell
[SHK] But come young waverer come go with me
[SHK] In one respect I 'll thy assistant be
[SHK] For this alliance may so happy prove
[SHK] To turn your households rancour to pure love
[SHK] O let us hence I stand on sudden haste
[SHK] Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
[SHK] Where the devil should this Romeo be
[SHK] Came he not home to-night
[SHK] Not to his father 's I spoke with his man
[SHK] Ah that same pale hard-hearted wench that Rosaline
[SHK] Torments him so that he will sure run mad
[SHK] Tybalt the kinsman of old Capulet
[SHK] Hath sent a letter to his father 's house
[SHK] A challenge on my life
[SHK] Romeo will answer it
[SHK] Any man that can write may answer a letter
[SHK] Nay he will answer the letter 's master how he
[SHK] dares being dared
[SHK] Alas poor Romeo he is already dead stabbed with a
[SHK] white wench 's black eye shot through the ear with a
[SHK] love-song the very pin of his heart cleft with the
[SHK] blind bow-boy 's butt-shaft and is he a man to
[SHK] encounter Tybalt
[SHK] Why what is Tybalt
[SHK] More than prince of cats I can tell you O he is
[SHK] the courageous captain of compliments He fights as
[SHK] you sing prick-song keeps time distance and
[SHK] proportion rests me his minim rest one two and
[SHK] the third in your bosom the very butcher of a silk
[SHK] button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the
[SHK] very first house of the first and second cause
[SHK] ah the immortal passado the punto reverso the
[SHK] hai
[SHK] The what
[SHK] The pox of such antic lisping affecting
[SHK] fantasticoes these new tuners of accents 'By Jesu
[SHK] a very good blade a very tall man a very good
[SHK] whore Why is not this a lamentable thing
[SHK] grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with
[SHK] these strange flies these fashion-mongers these
[SHK] perdona-mi 's who stand so much on the new form
[SHK] that they can not at ease on the old bench O their
[SHK] bones their bones
[SHK] Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo
[SHK] Without his roe like a dried herring flesh flesh
[SHK] how art thou fishified Now is he for the numbers
[SHK] that Petrarch flowed in Laura to his lady was but a
[SHK] kitchen-wench marry she had a better love to
[SHK] be-rhyme her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gipsy
[SHK] Helen and Hero hildings and harlots Thisbe a grey
[SHK] eye or so but not to the purpose Signior
[SHK] Romeo bon jour there 's a French salutation
[SHK] to your French slop You gave us the counterfeit
[SHK] fairly last night
[SHK] Good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you
[SHK] The ship sir the slip can you not conceive
[SHK] Pardon good Mercutio my business was great and in
[SHK] such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
[SHK] That 's as much as to say such a case as yours
[SHK] constrains a man to bow in the hams
[SHK] Meaning to court'sy
[SHK] Thou hast most kindly hit it
[SHK] A most courteous exposition
[SHK] Nay I am the very pink of courtesy
[SHK] Pink for flower
[SHK] Right
[SHK] Why then is my pump well flowered
[SHK] Well said follow me this jest now till thou hast
[SHK] worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it
[SHK] is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular
[SHK] O single-soled jest solely singular for the
[SHK] singleness
[SHK] Come between us good Benvolio my wits faint
[SHK] Switch and spurs switch and spurs or I 'll cry a match
[SHK] Nay if thy wits run the wild-goose chase I have
[SHK] done for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
[SHK] thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five
[SHK] was I with you there for the goose
[SHK] Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
[SHK] not there for the goose
[SHK] I will bite thee by the ear for that jest
[SHK] Nay good goose bite not
[SHK] Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most
[SHK] sharp sauce
[SHK] And is it not well served in to a sweet goose
[SHK] O here 's a wit of cheveril that stretches from an
[SHK] inch narrow to an ell broad
[SHK] I stretch it out for that word 'broad which added
[SHK] to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
[SHK] Why is not this better now than groaning for love
[SHK] now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art
[SHK] thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
[SHK] for this drivelling love is like a great natural
[SHK] that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
[SHK] Stop there stop there
[SHK] Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
[SHK] Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
[SHK] O thou art deceived I would have made it short
[SHK] for I was come to the whole depth of my tale and
[SHK] meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer
[SHK] Here 's goodly gear
[SHK] A sail a sail
[SHK] Two two a shirt and a smock

[SHK] My fan Peter
[SHK] Good Peter to hide her face for her fan 's the
[SHK] fairer face

[SHK] dial is now upon the prick of noon
[SHK] Out upon you what a man are you

[SHK] mar
[SHK] By my troth it is well said 'for himself to mar
[SHK] quoth a Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I
[SHK] may find the young Romeo
[SHK] I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when
[SHK] you have found him than he was when you sought him
[SHK] I am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse
[SHK] You say well
[SHK] Yea is the worst well very well took i faith
[SHK] wisely wisely

[SHK] you

[SHK] What hast thou found
[SHK] No hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie
[SHK] that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent
[SHK] An old hare hoar
[SHK] And an old hare hoar
[SHK] Is very good meat in lent
[SHK] But a hare that is hoar
[SHK] Is too much for a score
[SHK] When it hoars ere it be spent
[SHK] Romeo will you come to your father 's we 'll
[SHK] to dinner thither
[SHK] I will follow you
[SHK] Farewell ancient lady farewell
[SHK] 'lady lady lady

[SHK] merchant was this that was so full of his ropery
[SHK] A gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk
[SHK] and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
[SHK] to in a month
[SHK] An a speak any thing against me I 'll take him
[SHK] down an a were lustier than he is and twenty such
[SHK] Jacks and if I can not I 'll find those that shall
[SHK] Scurvy knave I am none of his flirt-gills I am
[SHK] none of his skains-mates And thou must stand by

[SHK] I saw no man use you a pleasure if I had my weapon
[SHK] should quickly have been out I warrant you I dare
[SHK] draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a
[SHK] good quarrel and the law on my side
[SHK] Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about
[SHK] me quivers Scurvy knave Pray you sir a word
[SHK] and as I told you my young lady bade me inquire you
[SHK] out what she bade me say I will keep to myself
[SHK] but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her into
[SHK] a fool 's paradise as they say it were a very gross
[SHK] kind of behavior as they say for the gentlewoman
[SHK] is young and therefore if you should deal double
[SHK] with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered
[SHK] to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing
[SHK] Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress I
[SHK] protest unto thee --
[SHK] Good heart and i faith I will tell her as much
[SHK] Lord Lord she will be a joyful woman
[SHK] What wilt thou tell her nurse thou dost not mark me
[SHK] I will tell her sir that you do protest which as
[SHK] I take it is a gentlemanlike offer
[SHK] Bid her devise
[SHK] Some means to come to shrift this afternoon
[SHK] And there she shall at Friar Laurence cell
[SHK] Be shrived and married Here is for thy pains
[SHK] No truly sir not a penny

[SHK] This afternoon sir well she shall be there
[SHK] And stay good nurse behind the abbey wall

[SHK] Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady -- Lord
[SHK] Lord when 't was a little prating thing -- O there
[SHK] is a nobleman in town one Paris that would fain
[SHK] lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lief
[SHK] see a toad a very toad as see him I anger her
[SHK] sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
[SHK] man but I 'll warrant you when I say so she looks

[SHK] Ay nurse what of that both with an R
[SHK] Ah mocker that 's the dog 's name R is for
[SHK] the -- No I know it begins with some other
[SHK] letter -- and she hath the prettiest sententious of
[SHK] it of you and rosemary that it would do you good
[SHK] to hear it
[SHK] Commend me to thy lady
[SHK] Ay a thousand times
[SHK] Peter
[SHK] Anon
[SHK] Peter take my fan and go before and apace
[SHK] The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse
[SHK] In half an hour she promised to return
[SHK] Perchance she can not meet him that 's not so
[SHK] O she is lame love 's heralds should be thoughts
[SHK] Which ten times faster glide than the sun 's beams
[SHK] Driving back shadows over louring hills
[SHK] Therefore do nimble-pinion 'd doves draw love
[SHK] And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings
[SHK] Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
[SHK] Of this day 's journey and from nine till twelve
[SHK] Is three long hours yet she is not come
[SHK] Had she affections and warm youthful blood
[SHK] She would be as swift in motion as a ball
[SHK] My words would bandy her to my sweet love
[SHK] And his to me
[SHK] But old folks many feign as they were dead
[SHK] Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
[SHK] O God she comes
[SHK] O honey nurse what news
[SHK] Hast thou met with him Send thy man away
[SHK] Peter stay at the gate
[SHK] Now good sweet nurse -- O Lord why look'st thou sad
[SHK] Though news be sad yet tell them merrily
[SHK] If good thou shamest the music of sweet news
[SHK] By playing it to me with so sour a face
[SHK] I am a-weary give me leave awhile
[SHK] Fie how my bones ache what a jaunt have I had
[SHK] I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
[SHK] Nay come I pray thee speak good good nurse speak
[SHK] Jesu what haste can you not stay awhile
[SHK] Do you not see that I am out of breath
[SHK] How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
[SHK] To say to me that thou art out of breath
[SHK] The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
[SHK] Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
[SHK] Is thy news good or bad answer to that
[SHK] Say either and I 'll stay the circumstance
[SHK] Let me be satisfied is't good or bad
[SHK] Well you have made a simple choice you know not
[SHK] how to choose a man Romeo no not he though his
[SHK] face be better than any man 's yet his leg excels
[SHK] all men 's and for a hand and a foot and a body
[SHK] though they be not to be talked on yet they are
[SHK] past compare he is not the flower of courtesy
[SHK] but I 'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb Go thy
[SHK] ways wench serve God What have you dined at home
[SHK] No no but all this did I know before
[SHK] What says he of our marriage what of that
[SHK] Lord how my head aches what a head have I
[SHK] It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
[SHK] My back o t other side -- O my back my back
[SHK] Beshrew your heart for sending me about
[SHK] To catch my death with jaunting up and down
[SHK] I faith I am sorry that thou art not well
[SHK] Sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
[SHK] Your love says like an honest gentleman and a
[SHK] courteous and a kind and a handsome and I
[SHK] warrant a virtuous -- Where is your mother
[SHK] Where is my mother why she is within
[SHK] Where should she be How oddly thou repliest
[SHK] 'Your love says like an honest gentleman
[SHK] Where is your mother
[SHK] O God 's lady dear
[SHK] Are you so hot marry come up I trow
[SHK] Is this the poultice for my aching bones
[SHK] Henceforward do your messages yourself
[SHK] Here 's such a coil come what says Romeo
[SHK] Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day
[SHK] I have
[SHK] Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence cell
[SHK] There stays a husband to make you a wife
[SHK] Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
[SHK] They 'll be in scarlet straight at any news
[SHK] Hie you to church I must another way
[SHK] To fetch a ladder by the which your love
[SHK] Must climb a bird 's nest soon when it is dark
[SHK] I am the drudge and toil in your delight
[SHK] But you shall bear the burden soon at night
[SHK] Go I 'll to dinner hie you to the cell
[SHK] Hie to high fortune Honest nurse farewell
[SHK] So smile the heavens upon this holy act
[SHK] That after hours with sorrow chide us not
[SHK] Amen amen but come what sorrow can
[SHK] It can not countervail the exchange of joy
[SHK] That one short minute gives me in her sight
[SHK] Do thou but close our hands with holy words
[SHK] Then love-devouring death do what he dare
[SHK] It is enough I may but call her mine
[SHK] These violent delights have violent ends
[SHK] And in their triumph die like fire and powder
[SHK] Which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
[SHK] Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
[SHK] And in the taste confounds the appetite
[SHK] Therefore love moderately long love doth so
[SHK] Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
[SHK] Here comes the lady O so light a foot
[SHK] Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint
[SHK] A lover may bestride the gossamer
[SHK] That idles in the wanton summer air
[SHK] And yet not fall so light is vanity
[SHK] Good even to my ghostly confessor
[SHK] Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
[SHK] As much to him else is his thanks too much
[SHK] Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
[SHK] Be heap 'd like mine and that thy skill be more
[SHK] To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
[SHK] This neighbour air and let rich music 's tongue
[SHK] Unfold the imagined happiness that both
[SHK] Receive in either by this dear encounter
[SHK] Conceit more rich in matter than in words
[SHK] Brags of his substance not of ornament
[SHK] They are but beggars that can count their worth
[SHK] But my true love is grown to such excess
[SHK] I can not sum up sum of half my wealth
[SHK] Come come with me and we will make short work
[SHK] For by your leaves you shall not stay alone
[SHK] Till holy church incorporate two in one
[SHK] I pray thee good Mercutio let 's retire
[SHK] The day is hot the Capulets abroad
[SHK] And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
[SHK] For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring
[SHK] Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
[SHK] enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
[SHK] upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
[SHK] thee and by the operation of the second cup draws
[SHK] it on the drawer when indeed there is no need
[SHK] Am I like such a fellow
[SHK] Come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
[SHK] any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as
[SHK] soon moody to be moved
[SHK] And what to
[SHK] Nay an there were two such we should have none
[SHK] shortly for one would kill the other Thou why
[SHK] thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more
[SHK] or a hair less in his beard than thou hast thou
[SHK] wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no
[SHK] other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what
[SHK] eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
[SHK] Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
[SHK] meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
[SHK] an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a
[SHK] man for coughing in the street because he hath
[SHK] wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
[SHK] didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
[SHK] his new doublet before Easter with another for
[SHK] tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
[SHK] wilt tutor me from quarrelling
[SHK] An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man
[SHK] should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter
[SHK] The fee-simple O simple
[SHK] By my head here come the Capulets
[SHK] By my heel I care not
[SHK] Follow me close for I will speak to them
[SHK] Gentlemen good den a word with one of you
[SHK] And but one word with one of us couple it with
[SHK] something make it a word and a blow
[SHK] You shall find me apt enough to that sir an you
[SHK] will give me occasion
[SHK] Could you not take some occasion without giving
[SHK] Mercutio thou consort'st with Romeo --
[SHK] Consort what dost thou make us minstrels an
[SHK] thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but
[SHK] discords here 's my fiddlestick here 's that shall
[SHK] make you dance 'Zounds consort
[SHK] We talk here in the public haunt of men
[SHK] Either withdraw unto some private place
[SHK] And reason coldly of your grievances
[SHK] Or else depart here all eyes gaze on us
[SHK] Men 's eyes were made to look and let them gaze
[SHK] I will not budge for no man 's pleasure I
[SHK] Well peace be with you sir here comes my man
[SHK] But I 'll be hanged sir if he wear your livery
[SHK] Marry go before to field he 'll be your follower
[SHK] Your worship in that sense may call him 'man
[SHK] Romeo the hate I bear thee can afford
[SHK] No better term than this -- thou art a villain
[SHK] Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee
[SHK] Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
[SHK] To such a greeting villain am I none
[SHK] Therefore farewell I see thou know'st me not
[SHK] Boy this shall not excuse the injuries
[SHK] That thou hast done me therefore turn and draw
[SHK] I do protest I never injured thee
[SHK] But love thee better than thou canst devise
[SHK] Till thou shalt know the reason of my love
[SHK] And so good Capulet -- which name I tender
[SHK] As dearly as my own -- be satisfied
[SHK] O calm dishonourable vile submission
[SHK] Alla stoccata carries it away
[SHK] Tybalt you rat-catcher will you walk
[SHK] What wouldst thou have with me
[SHK] Good king of cats nothing but one of your nine
[SHK] lives that I mean to make bold withal and as you
[SHK] shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest of the
[SHK] eight Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
[SHK] by the ears make haste lest mine be about your
[SHK] ears ere it be out
[SHK] I am for you
[SHK] Gentle Mercutio put thy rapier up
[SHK] Come sir your passado

[SHK] Ay ay a scratch a scratch marry 't is enough
[SHK] Where is my page Go villain fetch a surgeon
[SHK] Courage man the hurt can not be much
[SHK] No 't is not so deep as a well nor so wide as a
[SHK] church-door but 't is enough 'twill serve ask for
[SHK] me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man I
[SHK] am peppered I warrant for this world A plague o
[SHK] both your houses 'Zounds a dog a rat a mouse a
[SHK] cat to scratch a man to death a braggart a
[SHK] rogue a villain that fights by the book of
[SHK] arithmetic Why the devil came you between us I
[SHK] was hurt under your arm
[SHK] I thought all for the best
[SHK] Help me into some house Benvolio
[SHK] Or I shall faint A plague o both your houses
[SHK] They have made worms meat of me I have it
[SHK] And soundly too your houses
[SHK] This gentleman the prince 's near ally
[SHK] My very friend hath got his mortal hurt
[SHK] In my behalf my reputation stain 'd
[SHK] With Tybalt 's slander -- Tybalt that an hour
[SHK] Hath been my kinsman O sweet Juliet
[SHK] Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
[SHK] And in my temper soften 'd valour 's steel
[SHK] O Romeo Romeo brave Mercutio 's dead
[SHK] That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds
[SHK] Which too untimely here did scorn the earth
[SHK] This day 's black fate on more days doth depend
[SHK] This but begins the woe others must end
[SHK] Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
[SHK] Alive in triumph and Mercutio slain
[SHK] Away to heaven respective lenity
[SHK] And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now
[SHK] Now Tybalt take the villain back again
[SHK] That late thou gavest me for Mercutio 's soul
[SHK] Is but a little way above our heads
[SHK] Staying for thine to keep him company
[SHK] Either thou or I or both must go with him
[SHK] Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
[SHK] Shalt with him hence
[SHK] This shall determine that
[SHK] Romeo away be gone
[SHK] The citizens are up and Tybalt slain
[SHK] Stand not amazed the prince will doom thee death
[SHK] If thou art taken hence be gone away
[SHK] O I am fortune 's fool
[SHK] Why dost thou stay
[SHK] Which way ran he that kill 'd Mercutio
[SHK] Tybalt that murderer which way ran he
[SHK] There lies that Tybalt
[SHK] Up sir go with me
[SHK] I charge thee in the princes name obey
[SHK] Where are the vile beginners of this fray
[SHK] O noble prince I can discover all
[SHK] The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
[SHK] There lies the man slain by young Romeo
[SHK] That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio
[SHK] Tybalt my cousin O my brother 's child
[SHK] O prince O cousin husband O the blood is spilt
[SHK] O my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true
[SHK] For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
[SHK] O cousin cousin
[SHK] Benvolio who began this bloody fray
[SHK] Tybalt here slain whom Romeo 's hand did slay
[SHK] Romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
[SHK] How nice the quarrel was and urged withal
[SHK] Your high displeasure all this uttered
[SHK] With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow 'd
[SHK] Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
[SHK] Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
[SHK] With piercing steel at bold Mercutio 's breast
[SHK] Who all as hot turns deadly point to point
[SHK] And with a martial scorn with one hand beats
[SHK] Cold death aside and with the other sends
[SHK] It back to Tybalt whose dexterity
[SHK] Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
[SHK] 'Hold friends friends part and swifter than
[SHK] his tongue
[SHK] His agile arm beats down their fatal points
[SHK] And 'twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
[SHK] An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
[SHK] Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
[SHK] But by and by comes back to Romeo
[SHK] Who had but newly entertain 'd revenge
[SHK] And to 't they go like lightning for ere I
[SHK] Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
[SHK] And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
[SHK] This is the truth or let Benvolio die
[SHK] He is a kinsman to the Montague
[SHK] Affection makes him false he speaks not true
[SHK] Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
[SHK] And all those twenty could but kill one life
[SHK] I beg for justice which thou prince must give
[SHK] Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live
[SHK] Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
[SHK] Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
[SHK] Not Romeo prince he was Mercutio 's friend
[SHK] His fault concludes but what the law should end
[SHK] The life of Tybalt
[SHK] And for that offence
[SHK] Immediately we do exile him hence
[SHK] I have an interest in your hate 's proceeding
[SHK] My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding
[SHK] But I 'll amerce you with so strong a fine
[SHK] That you shall all repent the loss of mine
[SHK] I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
[SHK] Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
[SHK] Therefore use none let Romeo hence in haste
[SHK] Else when he 's found that hour is his last
[SHK] Bear hence this body and attend our will
[SHK] Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
[SHK] Gallop apace you fiery-footed steeds
[SHK] Towards Phoebus lodging such a wagoner
[SHK] As Phaethon would whip you to the west
[SHK] And bring in cloudy night immediately
[SHK] Spread thy close curtain love-performing night
[SHK] That runaway 's eyes may wink and Romeo
[SHK] Leap to these arms untalk 'd of and unseen
[SHK] Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
[SHK] By their own beauties or if love be blind
[SHK] It best agrees with night Come civil night
[SHK] Thou sober-suited matron all in black
[SHK] And learn me how to lose a winning match
[SHK] Play 'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
[SHK] Hood my unmann 'd blood bating in my cheeks
[SHK] With thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
[SHK] Think true love acted simple modesty
[SHK] Come night come Romeo come thou day in night
[SHK] For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
[SHK] Whiter than new snow on a raven 's back
[SHK] Come gentle night come loving black-brow 'd night
[SHK] Give me my Romeo and when he shall die
[SHK] Take him and cut him out in little stars
[SHK] And he will make the face of heaven so fine
[SHK] That all the world will be in love with night
[SHK] And pay no worship to the garish sun
[SHK] O I have bought the mansion of a love
[SHK] But not possess 'd it and though I am sold
[SHK] Not yet enjoy 'd so tedious is this day
[SHK] As is the night before some festival
[SHK] To an impatient child that hath new robes
[SHK] And may not wear them O here comes my nurse
[SHK] And she brings news and every tongue that speaks
[SHK] But Romeo 's name speaks heavenly eloquence
[SHK] Now nurse what news What hast thou there the cords
[SHK] That Romeo bid thee fetch
[SHK] Ay ay the cords
[SHK] Ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands
[SHK] Ah well-a-day he 's dead he 's dead he 's dead
[SHK] We are undone lady we are undone
[SHK] Alack the day he 's gone he 's kill 'd he 's dead
[SHK] Can heaven be so envious
[SHK] Romeo can
[SHK] Though heaven can not O Romeo Romeo
[SHK] Who ever would have thought it Romeo
[SHK] What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
[SHK] This torture should be roar 'd in dismal hell
[SHK] Hath Romeo slain himself say thou but I
[SHK] And that bare vowel I shall poison more
[SHK] Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice
[SHK] I am not I if there be such an I
[SHK] Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I
[SHK] If he be slain say I or if not no
[SHK] Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
[SHK] I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes --
[SHK] God save the mark -- here on his manly breast
[SHK] A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
[SHK] Pale pale as ashes all bedaub 'd in blood
[SHK] All in gore-blood I swounded at the sight
[SHK] O break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
[SHK] To prison eyes ne'er look on liberty
[SHK] Vile earth to earth resign end motion here
[SHK] And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier
[SHK] O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
[SHK] O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
[SHK] That ever I should live to see thee dead
[SHK] What storm is this that blows so contrary
[SHK] Is Romeo slaughter 'd and is Tybalt dead
[SHK] My dear-loved cousin and my dearer lord
[SHK] Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
[SHK] For who is living if those two are gone
[SHK] Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
[SHK] Romeo that kill 'd him he is banished
[SHK] O God did Romeo 's hand shed Tybalt 's blood
[SHK] It did it did alas the day it did
[SHK] O serpent heart hid with a flowering face
[SHK] Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
[SHK] Beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
[SHK] Dove-feather 'd raven wolvish-ravening lamb
[SHK] Despised substance of divinest show
[SHK] Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st
[SHK] A damned saint an honourable villain
[SHK] O nature what hadst thou to do in hell
[SHK] When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
[SHK] In moral paradise of such sweet flesh
[SHK] Was ever book containing such vile matter
[SHK] So fairly bound O that deceit should dwell
[SHK] In such a gorgeous palace
[SHK] There 's no trust
[SHK] No faith no honesty in men all perjured
[SHK] All forsworn all naught all dissemblers
[SHK] Ah where 's my man give me some aqua vitae
[SHK] These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
[SHK] Shame come to Romeo
[SHK] Blister 'd be thy tongue
[SHK] For such a wish he was not born to shame
[SHK] Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
[SHK] For 't is a throne where honour may be crown 'd
[SHK] Sole monarch of the universal earth
[SHK] O what a beast was I to chide at him
[SHK] Will you speak well of him that kill 'd your cousin
[SHK] Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
[SHK] Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
[SHK] When I thy three-hours wife have mangled it
[SHK] But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
[SHK] That villain cousin would have kill 'd my husband
[SHK] Back foolish tears back to your native spring
[SHK] Your tributary drops belong to woe
[SHK] Which you mistaking offer up to joy
[SHK] My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
[SHK] And Tybalt 's dead that would have slain my husband
[SHK] All this is comfort wherefore weep I then
[SHK] Some word there was worser than Tybalt 's death
[SHK] That murder 'd me I would forget it fain
[SHK] But O it presses to my memory
[SHK] Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
[SHK] 'Tybalt is dead and Romeo -- banished
[SHK] That 'banished that one word 'banished
[SHK] Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalt 's death
[SHK] Was woe enough if it had ended there
[SHK] Or if sour woe delights in fellowship
[SHK] And needly will be rank 'd with other griefs
[SHK] Why follow 'd not when she said 'Tybalt 's dead
[SHK] Thy father or thy mother nay or both
[SHK] Which modern lamentations might have moved
[SHK] But with a rear-ward following Tybalt 's death
[SHK] 'Romeo is banished to speak that word
[SHK] Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
[SHK] All slain all dead 'Romeo is banished
[SHK] There is no end no limit measure bound
[SHK] In that word 's death no words can that woe sound
[SHK] Where is my father and my mother nurse
[SHK] Weeping and wailing over Tybalt 's corse
[SHK] Will you go to them I will bring you thither
[SHK] Wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent
[SHK] When theirs are dry for Romeo 's banishment
[SHK] Take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled
[SHK] Both you and I for Romeo is exiled
[SHK] He made you for a highway to my bed
[SHK] But I a maid die maiden-widowed
[SHK] Come cords come nurse I 'll to my wedding-bed
[SHK] And death not Romeo take my maidenhead
[SHK] Hie to your chamber I 'll find Romeo
[SHK] To comfort you I wot well where he is
[SHK] Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
[SHK] I 'll to him he is hid at Laurence cell
[SHK] O find him give this ring to my true knight
[SHK] And bid him come to take his last farewell
[SHK] Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
[SHK] Affliction is enamour 'd of thy parts
[SHK] And thou art wedded to calamity
[SHK] Father what news what is the prince 's doom
[SHK] What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
[SHK] That I yet know not
[SHK] Too familiar
[SHK] Is my dear son with such sour company
[SHK] I bring thee tidings of the prince 's doom
[SHK] What less than dooms-day is the prince 's doom
[SHK] A gentler judgment vanish 'd from his lips
[SHK] Not body 's death but body 's banishment
[SHK] Ha banishment be merciful say 'death
[SHK] For exile hath more terror in his look
[SHK] Much more than death do not say 'banishment
[SHK] Hence from Verona art thou banished
[SHK] Be patient for the world is broad and wide
[SHK] There is no world without Verona walls
[SHK] But purgatory torture hell itself
[SHK] Hence-banished is banish 'd from the world
[SHK] And world 's exile is death then banished
[SHK] Is death mis-term 'd calling death banishment
[SHK] Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe
[SHK] And smilest upon the stroke that murders me
[SHK] O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness
[SHK] Thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
[SHK] Taking thy part hath rush 'd aside the law
[SHK] And turn 'd that black word death to banishment
[SHK] This is dear mercy and thou seest it not
[SHK] 'T is torture and not mercy heaven is here
[SHK] Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog
[SHK] And little mouse every unworthy thing
[SHK] Live here in heaven and may look on her
[SHK] But Romeo may not more validity
[SHK] More honourable state more courtship lives
[SHK] In carrion-flies than Romeo they my seize
[SHK] On the white wonder of dear Juliet 's hand
[SHK] And steal immortal blessing from her lips
[SHK] Who even in pure and vestal modesty
[SHK] Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
[SHK] But Romeo may not he is banished
[SHK] Flies may do this but I from this must fly
[SHK] They are free men but I am banished
[SHK] And say'st thou yet that exile is not death
[SHK] Hadst thou no poison mix 'd no sharp-ground knife
[SHK] No sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean
[SHK] But 'banished to kill me -- 'banished
[SHK] O friar the damned use that word in hell
[SHK] Howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
[SHK] Being a divine a ghostly confessor
[SHK] A sin-absolver and my friend profess 'd
[SHK] To mangle me with that word 'banished
[SHK] Thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word
[SHK] O thou wilt speak again of banishment
[SHK] I 'll give thee armour to keep off that word
[SHK] Adversity 's sweet milk philosophy
[SHK] To comfort thee though thou art banished
[SHK] Yet 'banished Hang up philosophy
[SHK] Unless philosophy can make a Juliet
[SHK] Displant a town reverse a prince 's doom
[SHK] It helps not it prevails not talk no more
[SHK] O then I see that madmen have no ears
[SHK] How should they when that wise men have no eyes
[SHK] Let me dispute with thee of thy estate
[SHK] Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
[SHK] Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love
[SHK] An hour but married Tybalt murdered
[SHK] Doting like me and like me banished
[SHK] Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
[SHK] And fall upon the ground as I do now
[SHK] Taking the measure of an unmade grave
[SHK] Arise one knocks good Romeo hide thyself
[SHK] Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans
[SHK] Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes
[SHK] Hark how they knock Who 's there Romeo arise
[SHK] Thou wilt be taken Stay awhile Stand up
[SHK] Run to my study By and by God 's will
[SHK] What simpleness is this I come I come
[SHK] Who knocks so hard whence come you what 's your will
[SHK] my errand
[SHK] I come from Lady Juliet
[SHK] Welcome then
[SHK] O holy friar O tell me holy friar
[SHK] Where is my lady 's lord where 's Romeo
[SHK] There on the ground with his own tears made drunk
[SHK] O he is even in my mistress case
[SHK] Just in her case O woful sympathy
[SHK] Piteous predicament Even so lies she
[SHK] Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
[SHK] Stand up stand up stand and you be a man
[SHK] For Juliet 's sake for her sake rise and stand
[SHK] Why should you fall into so deep an O
[SHK] Nurse
[SHK] Ah sir ah sir Well death 's the end of all
[SHK] Spakest thou of Juliet how is it with her
[SHK] Doth she not think me an old murderer
[SHK] Now I have stain 'd the childhood of our joy
[SHK] With blood removed but little from her own
[SHK] Where is she and how doth she and what says
[SHK] My conceal 'd lady to our cancell 'd love
[SHK] O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
[SHK] And now falls on her bed and then starts up
[SHK] And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
[SHK] And then down falls again
[SHK] As if that name
[SHK] Shot from the deadly level of a gun
[SHK] Did murder her as that name 's cursed hand
[SHK] Murder 'd her kinsman O tell me friar tell me
[SHK] In what vile part of this anatomy
[SHK] Doth my name lodge tell me that I may sack
[SHK] The hateful mansion
[SHK] Hold thy desperate hand
[SHK] Art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
[SHK] Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
[SHK] The unreasonable fury of a beast
[SHK] Unseemly woman in a seeming man
[SHK] Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both
[SHK] Thou hast amazed me by my holy order
[SHK] I thought thy disposition better temper 'd
[SHK] Hast thou slain Tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
[SHK] And stay thy lady too that lives in thee
[SHK] By doing damned hate upon thyself
[SHK] Why rail'st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
[SHK] Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
[SHK] In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
[SHK] Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
[SHK] Which like a usurer abound'st in all
[SHK] And usest none in that true use indeed
[SHK] Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
[SHK] Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
[SHK] Digressing from the valour of a man
[SHK] Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
[SHK] Killing that love which thou hast vow 'd to cherish
[SHK] Thy wit that ornament to shape and love
[SHK] Misshapen in the conduct of them both
[SHK] Like powder in a skitless soldier 's flask
[SHK] Is set afire by thine own ignorance
[SHK] And thou dismember 'd with thine own defence
[SHK] What rouse thee man thy Juliet is alive
[SHK] For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
[SHK] There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
[SHK] But thou slew'st Tybalt there are thou happy too
[SHK] The law that threaten 'd death becomes thy friend
[SHK] And turns it to exile there art thou happy
[SHK] A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back
[SHK] Happiness courts thee in her best array
[SHK] But like a misbehaved and sullen wench
[SHK] Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love
[SHK] Take heed take heed for such die miserable
[SHK] Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
[SHK] Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
[SHK] But look thou stay not till the watch be set
[SHK] For then thou canst not pass to Mantua
[SHK] Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
[SHK] To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
[SHK] Beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
[SHK] With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
[SHK] Than thou went'st forth in lamentation
[SHK] Go before nurse commend me to thy lady
[SHK] And bid her hasten all the house to bed
[SHK] Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
[SHK] Romeo is coming
[SHK] O Lord I could have stay 'd here all the night
[SHK] To hear good counsel O what learning is
[SHK] My lord I 'll tell my lady you will come
[SHK] Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
[SHK] Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
[SHK] Hie you make haste for it grows very late
[SHK] How well my comfort is revived by this
[SHK] Go hence good night and here stands all your state
[SHK] Either be gone before the watch be set
[SHK] Or by the break of day disguised from hence
[SHK] Sojourn in Mantua I 'll find out your man
[SHK] And he shall signify from time to time
[SHK] Every good hap to you that chances here
[SHK] Give me thy hand 't is late farewell good night
[SHK] But that a joy past joy calls out on me
[SHK] It were a grief so brief to part with thee Farewell
[SHK] Things have fall'n out sir so unluckily
[SHK] That we have had no time to move our daughter
[SHK] Look you she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly
[SHK] And so did I -- Well we were born to die
[SHK] 'T is very late she 'll not come down to-night
[SHK] I promise you but for your company
[SHK] I would have been a-bed an hour ago
[SHK] These times of woe afford no time to woo
[SHK] Madam good night commend me to your daughter
[SHK] I will and know her mind early to-morrow
[SHK] To-night she is mew 'd up to her heaviness
[SHK] Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender
[SHK] Of my child 's love I think she will be ruled
[SHK] In all respects by me nay more I doubt it not
[SHK] Wife go you to her ere you go to bed
[SHK] Acquaint her here of my son Paris love

[SHK] She shall be married to this noble earl
[SHK] Will you be ready do you like this haste
[SHK] We 'll keep no great ado -- a friend or two
[SHK] For hark you Tybalt being slain so late
[SHK] It may be thought we held him carelessly
[SHK] Being our kinsman if we revel much
[SHK] Therefore we 'll have some half a dozen friends
[SHK] And there an end But what say you to Thursday
[SHK] My lord I would that Thursday were to-morrow
[SHK] Well get you gone o Thursday be it then
[SHK] Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
[SHK] Prepare her wife against this wedding-day
[SHK] Farewell my lord Light to my chamber ho
[SHK] Afore me it is so very very late
[SHK] That we may call it early by and by
[SHK] Good night
[SHK] Wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
[SHK] It was the nightingale and not the lark
[SHK] That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
[SHK] Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree
[SHK] Believe me love it was the nightingale
[SHK] It was the lark the herald of the morn
[SHK] No nightingale look love what envious streaks
[SHK] Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
[SHK] Night 's candles are burnt out and jocund day
[SHK] Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
[SHK] I must be gone and live or stay and die
[SHK] Yon light is not day-light I know it I
[SHK] It is some meteor that the sun exhales
[SHK] To be to thee this night a torch-bearer
[SHK] And light thee on thy way to Mantua
[SHK] Therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone
[SHK] Let me be ta'en let me be put to death
[SHK] I am content so thou wilt have it so
[SHK] I 'll say yon grey is not the morning 's eye
[SHK] 'T is but the pale reflex of Cynthia 's brow
[SHK] Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
[SHK] The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
[SHK] I have more care to stay than will to go
[SHK] Come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
[SHK] How is't my soul let 's talk it is not day
[SHK] It is it is hie hence be gone away
[SHK] It is the lark that sings so out of tune
[SHK] Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
[SHK] Some say the lark makes sweet division
[SHK] This doth not so for she divideth us
[SHK] Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
[SHK] O now I would they had changed voices too
[SHK] Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
[SHK] Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day
[SHK] O now be gone more light and light it grows
[SHK] More light and light more dark and dark our woes
[SHK] Madam
[SHK] Nurse
[SHK] Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
[SHK] The day is broke be wary look about
[SHK] Then window let day in and let life out
[SHK] Farewell farewell one kiss and I 'll descend
[SHK] Art thou gone so love lord ay husband friend
[SHK] I must hear from thee every day in the hour
[SHK] For in a minute there are many days
[SHK] O by this count I shall be much in years
[SHK] Ere I again behold my Romeo
[SHK] Farewell
[SHK] I will omit no opportunity
[SHK] That may convey my greetings love to thee
[SHK] O think'st thou we shall ever meet again
[SHK] I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
[SHK] For sweet discourses in our time to come
[SHK] O God I have an ill-divining soul
[SHK] Methinks I see thee now thou art below
[SHK] As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
[SHK] Either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale
[SHK] And trust me love in my eye so do you
[SHK] Dry sorrow drinks our blood Adieu adieu
[SHK] O fortune fortune all men call thee fickle
[SHK] If thou art fickle what dost thou with him
[SHK] That is renown 'd for faith Be fickle fortune
[SHK] For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
[SHK] But send him back
[SHK] Who is't that calls is it my lady mother
[SHK] Is she not down so late or up so early
[SHK] What unaccustom 'd cause procures her hither
[SHK] Why how now Juliet
[SHK] Madam I am not well
[SHK] Evermore weeping for your cousin 's death
[SHK] What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
[SHK] An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
[SHK] Therefore have done some grief shows much of love
[SHK] But much of grief shows still some want of wit
[SHK] Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
[SHK] So shall you feel the loss but not the friend
[SHK] Which you weep for
[SHK] Feeling so the loss
[SHK] Can not choose but ever weep the friend
[SHK] Well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death
[SHK] As that the villain lives which slaughter 'd him
[SHK] What villain madam
[SHK] That same villain Romeo
[SHK] God Pardon him I do with all my heart
[SHK] And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
[SHK] That is because the traitor murderer lives
[SHK] Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
[SHK] Would none but I might venge my cousin 's death
[SHK] We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
[SHK] Then weep no more I 'll send to one in Mantua
[SHK] Where that same banish 'd runagate doth live
[SHK] Shall give him such an unaccustom 'd dram
[SHK] That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
[SHK] And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied
[SHK] Indeed I never shall be satisfied
[SHK] With Romeo till I behold him -- dead --
[SHK] Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex 'd
[SHK] Madam if you could find out but a man
[SHK] To bear a poison I would temper it
[SHK] That Romeo should upon receipt thereof
[SHK] Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
[SHK] To hear him named and can not come to him
[SHK] To wreak the love I bore my cousin
[SHK] Upon his body that slaughter 'd him
[SHK] Find thou the means and I 'll find such a man
[SHK] But now I 'll tell thee joyful tidings girl
[SHK] And joy comes well in such a needy time
[SHK] What are they I beseech your ladyship
[SHK] Well well thou hast a careful father child
[SHK] One who to put thee from thy heaviness
[SHK] Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
[SHK] That thou expect'st not nor I look 'd not for
[SHK] Madam in happy time what day is that
[SHK] Marry my child early next Thursday morn
[SHK] The gallant young and noble gentleman
[SHK] The County Paris at Saint Peter 's Church
[SHK] Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
[SHK] Now by Saint Peter 's Church and Peter too
[SHK] He shall not make me there a joyful bride
[SHK] I wonder at this haste that I must wed
[SHK] Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
[SHK] I pray you tell my lord and father madam
[SHK] I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
[SHK] It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
[SHK] Rather than Paris These are news indeed
[SHK] Here comes your father tell him so yourself
[SHK] And see how he will take it at your hands
[SHK] When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
[SHK] But for the sunset of my brother 's son
[SHK] It rains downright
[SHK] How now a conduit girl what still in tears
[SHK] Evermore showering In one little body
[SHK] Thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind
[SHK] For still thy eyes which I may call the sea
[SHK] Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
[SHK] Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
[SHK] Who raging with thy tears and they with them
[SHK] Without a sudden calm will overset
[SHK] Thy tempest-tossed body How now wife
[SHK] Have you deliver 'd to her our decree
[SHK] Ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
[SHK] I would the fool were married to her grave
[SHK] Soft take me with you take me with you wife
[SHK] How will she none doth she not give us thanks
[SHK] Is she not proud doth she not count her blest
[SHK] Unworthy as she is that we have wrought
[SHK] So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
[SHK] Not proud you have but thankful that you have
[SHK] Proud can I never be of what I hate
[SHK] But thankful even for hate that is meant love
[SHK] How now how now chop-logic What is this
[SHK] 'Proud and I thank you and I thank you not
[SHK] And yet 'not proud mistress minion you
[SHK] Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds

[SHK] Out you green-sickness carrion out you baggage
[SHK] You tallow-face

[SHK] Speak not reply not do not answer me
[SHK] My fingers itch Wife we scarce thought us blest
[SHK] That God had lent us but this only child
[SHK] But now I see this one is one too much
[SHK] And that we have a curse in having her
[SHK] Out on her hilding
[SHK] God in heaven bless her
[SHK] You are to blame my lord to rate her so
[SHK] And why my lady wisdom hold your tongue
[SHK] Good prudence smatter with your gossips go
[SHK] I speak no treason
[SHK] O God ye god-den
[SHK] May not one speak

[SHK] For here we need it not
[SHK] You are too hot
[SHK] God 's bread it makes me mad
[SHK] Day night hour tide time work play
[SHK] Alone in company still my care hath been
[SHK] To have her match 'd and having now provided
[SHK] A gentleman of noble parentage
[SHK] Of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train 'd
[SHK] Stuff 'd as they say with honourable parts
[SHK] Proportion 'd as one 's thought would wish a man
[SHK] And then to have a wretched puling fool
[SHK] A whining mammet in her fortune 's tender
[SHK] To answer I 'll not wed I can not love
[SHK] I am too young I pray you pardon me
[SHK] But as you will not wed I 'll pardon you
[SHK] Graze where you will you shall not house with me

[SHK] Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
[SHK] Trust to't bethink you I 'll not be forsworn
[SHK] Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
[SHK] That sees into the bottom of my grief
[SHK] O sweet my mother cast me not away
[SHK] Delay this marriage for a month a week
[SHK] Or if you do not make the bridal bed
[SHK] In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
[SHK] Talk not to me for I 'll not speak a word
[SHK] Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee
[SHK] O God -- O nurse how shall this be prevented
[SHK] My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
[SHK] How shall that faith return again to earth
[SHK] Unless that husband send it me from heaven
[SHK] By leaving earth comfort me counsel me
[SHK] Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
[SHK] Upon so soft a subject as myself
[SHK] What say'st thou hast thou not a word of joy
[SHK] Some comfort nurse
[SHK] Faith here it is
[SHK] Romeo is banish 'd and all the world to nothing
[SHK] That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you
[SHK] Or if he do it needs must be by stealth
[SHK] Then since the case so stands as now it doth
[SHK] I think it best you married with the county

[SHK] Having displeased my father to Laurence cell
[SHK] To make confession and to be absolved
[SHK] Marry I will and this is wisely done
[SHK] Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend
[SHK] Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
[SHK] Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
[SHK] Which she hath praised him with above compare
[SHK] So many thousand times Go counsellor
[SHK] Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
[SHK] I 'll to the friar to know his remedy
[SHK] If all else fail myself have power to die
[SHK] On Thursday sir the time is very short
[SHK] My father Capulet will have it so
[SHK] And I am nothing slow to slack his haste
[SHK] You say you do not know the lady 's mind
[SHK] Uneven is the course I like it not
[SHK] Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt 's death
[SHK] And therefore have I little talk 'd of love
[SHK] For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
[SHK] Now sir her father counts it dangerous
[SHK] That she doth give her sorrow so much sway
[SHK] And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
[SHK] To stop the inundation of her tears
[SHK] Which too much minded by herself alone
[SHK] May be put from her by society
[SHK] Now do you know the reason of this haste
[SHK] Look sir here comes the lady towards my cell
[SHK] Happily met my lady and my wife
[SHK] That may be sir when I may be a wife
[SHK] That may be must be love on Thursday next
[SHK] What must be shall be
[SHK] That 's a certain text
[SHK] Come you to make confession to this father
[SHK] To answer that I should confess to you
[SHK] Do not deny to him that you love me
[SHK] I will confess to you that I love him
[SHK] So will ye I am sure that you love me
[SHK] If I do so it will be of more price
[SHK] Being spoke behind your back than to your face
[SHK] Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
[SHK] The tears have got small victory by that
[SHK] For it was bad enough before their spite
[SHK] Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report
[SHK] That is no slander sir which is a truth
[SHK] And what I spake I spake it to my face
[SHK] Thy face is mine and thou hast slander 'd it
[SHK] It may be so for it is not mine own
[SHK] Are you at leisure holy father now
[SHK] Or shall I come to you at evening mass
[SHK] My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
[SHK] My lord we must entreat the time alone
[SHK] God shield I should disturb devotion
[SHK] Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
[SHK] Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
[SHK] O shut the door and when thou hast done so
[SHK] Come weep with me past hope past cure past help
[SHK] Ah Juliet I already know thy grief
[SHK] It strains me past the compass of my wits
[SHK] I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
[SHK] On Thursday next be married to this county
[SHK] Tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this
[SHK] Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
[SHK] If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
[SHK] Do thou but call my resolution wise
[SHK] And with this knife I 'll help it presently
[SHK] God join 'd my heart and Romeo 's thou our hands
[SHK] And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal 'd
[SHK] Shall be the label to another deed
[SHK] Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
[SHK] Turn to another this shall slay them both
[SHK] Therefore out of thy long-experienced time
[SHK] Give me some present counsel or behold
[SHK] 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
[SHK] Shall play the umpire arbitrating that
[SHK] Which the commission of thy years and art
[SHK] Could to no issue of true honour bring
[SHK] Be not so long to speak I long to die
[SHK] If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy
[SHK] Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
[SHK] Which craves as desperate an execution
[SHK] As that is desperate which we would prevent
[SHK] If rather than to marry County Paris
[SHK] Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
[SHK] Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
[SHK] A thing like death to chide away this shame
[SHK] That copest with death himself to scape from it
[SHK] And if thou darest I 'll give thee remedy
[SHK] O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
[SHK] From off the battlements of yonder tower
[SHK] Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
[SHK] Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
[SHK] Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house
[SHK] O'er-cover 'd quite with dead men 's rattling bones
[SHK] With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
[SHK] Or bid me go into a new-made grave
[SHK] And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
[SHK] Things that to hear them told have made me tremble
[SHK] And I will do it without fear or doubt
[SHK] To live an unstain 'd wife to my sweet love
[SHK] Hold then go home be merry give consent
[SHK] To marry Paris Wednesday is to-morrow
[SHK] To-morrow night look that thou lie alone
[SHK] Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
[SHK] Take thou this vial being then in bed
[SHK] And this distilled liquor drink thou off
[SHK] When presently through all thy veins shall run
[SHK] A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
[SHK] Shall keep his native progress but surcease
[SHK] No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
[SHK] The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
[SHK] To paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
[SHK] Like death when he shuts up the day of life
[SHK] Each part deprived of supple government
[SHK] Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
[SHK] And in this borrow 'd likeness of shrunk death
[SHK] Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
[SHK] And then awake as from a pleasant sleep
[SHK] Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
[SHK] To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
[SHK] Then as the manner of our country is
[SHK] In thy best robes uncover 'd on the bier
[SHK] Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
[SHK] Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
[SHK] In the mean time against thou shalt awake
[SHK] Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
[SHK] And hither shall he come and he and I
[SHK] Will watch thy waking and that very night
[SHK] Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
[SHK] And this shall free thee from this present shame
[SHK] If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
[SHK] Abate thy valour in the acting it
[SHK] Give me give me O tell not me of fear
[SHK] Hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
[SHK] In this resolve I 'll send a friar with speed
[SHK] To Mantua with my letters to thy lord
[SHK] Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
[SHK] Farewell dear father
[SHK] So many guests invite as here are writ
[SHK] Sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks
[SHK] You shall have none ill sir for I 'll try if they
[SHK] can lick their fingers
[SHK] How canst thou try them so
[SHK] Marry sir 't is an ill cook that can not lick his
[SHK] own fingers therefore he that can not lick his
[SHK] fingers goes not with me
[SHK] Go be gone
[SHK] We shall be much unfurnished for this time
[SHK] What is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence
[SHK] Ay forsooth
[SHK] Well he may chance to do some good on her
[SHK] A peevish self-will 'd harlotry it is
[SHK] See where she comes from shrift with merry look
[SHK] How now my headstrong where have you been gadding
[SHK] Where I have learn 'd me to repent the sin
[SHK] Of disobedient opposition
[SHK] To you and your behests and am enjoin 'd
[SHK] By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
[SHK] And beg your pardon pardon I beseech you
[SHK] Henceforward I am ever ruled by you
[SHK] Send for the county go tell him of this
[SHK] I 'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning
[SHK] I met the youthful lord at Laurence cell
[SHK] And gave him what becomed love I might
[SHK] Not step o'er the bounds of modesty
[SHK] Why I am glad o n't this is well stand up
[SHK] This is as't should be Let me see the county
[SHK] Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither
[SHK] Now afore God this reverend holy friar
[SHK] Our whole city is much bound to him
[SHK] Nurse will you go with me into my closet
[SHK] To help me sort such needful ornaments
[SHK] As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow
[SHK] No not till Thursday there is time enough
[SHK] Go nurse go with her we 'll to church to-morrow
[SHK] We shall be short in our provision
[SHK] 'T is now near night
[SHK] Tush I will stir about
[SHK] And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife
[SHK] Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her
[SHK] I 'll not to bed to-night let me alone
[SHK] I 'll play the housewife for this once What ho
[SHK] They are all forth Well I will walk myself
[SHK] To County Paris to prepare him up
[SHK] Against to-morrow my heart is wondrous light
[SHK] Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim 'd
[SHK] Ay those attires are best but gentle nurse
[SHK] I pray thee leave me to myself to-night
[SHK] For I have need of many orisons
[SHK] To move the heavens to smile upon my state
[SHK] Which well thou know'st is cross and full of sin
[SHK] What are you busy ho need you my help
[SHK] No madam we have cull 'd such necessaries
[SHK] As are behoveful for our state to-morrow
[SHK] So please you let me now be left alone
[SHK] And let the nurse this night sit up with you
[SHK] For I am sure you have your hands full all
[SHK] In this so sudden business
[SHK] Good night
[SHK] Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
[SHK] Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
[SHK] I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
[SHK] That almost freezes up the heat of life
[SHK] I 'll call them back again to comfort me
[SHK] Nurse What should she do here
[SHK] My dismal scene I needs must act alone
[SHK] Come vial
[SHK] What if this mixture do not work at all
[SHK] Shall I be married then to-morrow morning
[SHK] No no this shall forbid it lie thou there
[SHK] What if it be a poison which the friar
[SHK] Subtly hath minister 'd to have me dead
[SHK] Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour 'd
[SHK] Because he married me before to Romeo
[SHK] I fear it is and yet methinks it should not
[SHK] For he hath still been tried a holy man
[SHK] How if when I am laid into the tomb
[SHK] I wake before the time that Romeo
[SHK] Come to redeem me there 's a fearful point
[SHK] Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
[SHK] To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
[SHK] And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
[SHK] Or if I live is it not very like
[SHK] The horrible conceit of death and night
[SHK] Together with the terror of the place --
[SHK] As in a vault an ancient receptacle
[SHK] Where for these many hundred years the bones
[SHK] Of all my buried ancestors are packed
[SHK] Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
[SHK] Lies festering in his shroud where as they say
[SHK] At some hours in the night spirits resort --
[SHK] Alack alack is it not like that I
[SHK] So early waking what with loathsome smells
[SHK] And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
[SHK] That living mortals hearing them run mad --
[SHK] O if I wake shall I not be distraught
[SHK] Environed with all these hideous fears
[SHK] And madly play with my forefather 's joints
[SHK] And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
[SHK] And in this rage with some great kinsman 's bone
[SHK] As with a club dash out my desperate brains
[SHK] O look methinks I see my cousin 's ghost
[SHK] Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
[SHK] Upon a rapier 's point stay Tybalt stay
[SHK] Romeo I come this do I drink to thee
[SHK] Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse
[SHK] They call for dates and quinces in the pastry
[SHK] Come stir stir stir the second cock hath crow 'd

[SHK] Upon the sweetest flower of all the field
[SHK] O lamentable day
[SHK] O woful time
[SHK] Death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail
[SHK] Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak

[SHK] Death is my son-in-law Death is my heir
[SHK] My daughter he hath wedded I will die
[SHK] And leave him all life living all is Death 's
[SHK] Have I thought long to see this morning 's face
[SHK] And doth it give me such a sight as this
[SHK] Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
[SHK] Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
[SHK] In lasting labour of his pilgrimage
[SHK] But one poor one one poor and loving child
[SHK] But one thing to rejoice and solace in
[SHK] And cruel death hath catch 'd it from my sight
[SHK] O woe O woful woful woful day
[SHK] Most lamentable day most woful day
[SHK] That ever ever I did yet behold

[SHK] Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
[SHK] And all the better is it for the maid
[SHK] Your part in her you could not keep from death
[SHK] But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
[SHK] The most you sought was her promotion
[SHK] For 't was your heaven she should be advanced
[SHK] And weep ye now seeing she is advanced
[SHK] Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
[SHK] O in this love you love your child so ill
[SHK] That you run mad seeing that she is well
[SHK] She 's not well married that lives married long
[SHK] But she 's best married that dies married young
[SHK] Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
[SHK] On this fair corse and as the custom is
[SHK] In all her best array bear her to church
[SHK] For though fond nature bids us an lament
[SHK] Yet nature 's tears are reason 's merriment
[SHK] All things that we ordained festival
[SHK] Turn from their office to black funeral
[SHK] Our instruments to melancholy bells
[SHK] Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
[SHK] Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
[SHK] Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
[SHK] And all things change them to the contrary
[SHK] Sir go you in and madam go with him
[SHK] And go Sir Paris every one prepare
[SHK] To follow this fair corse unto her grave
[SHK] The heavens do lour upon you for some ill
[SHK] Move them no more by crossing their high will
[SHK] Faith we may put up our pipes and be gone
[SHK] Honest goodfellows ah put up put up
[SHK] For well you know this is a pitiful case
[SHK] Ay by my troth the case may be amended
[SHK] Musicians O musicians 'Heart 's ease Heart 's
[SHK] ease O an you will have me live play 'Heart 's ease
[SHK] Why 'Heart 's ease
[SHK] O musicians because my heart itself plays 'My
[SHK] heart is full of woe O play me some merry dump
[SHK] to comfort me
[SHK] Not a dump we 't is no time to play now
[SHK] You will not then
[SHK] No
[SHK] I will then give it you soundly
[SHK] What will you give us
[SHK] No money on my faith but the gleek
[SHK] I will give you the minstrel
[SHK] Then I will give you the serving-creature
[SHK] Then will I lay the serving-creature 's dagger on
[SHK] your pate I will carry no crotchets I 'll re you
[SHK] I 'll fa you do you note me
[SHK] An you re us and fa us you note us

[SHK] Then have at you with my wit I will dry-beat you

[SHK] 'When griping grief the heart doth wound
[SHK] And doleful dumps the mind oppress
[SHK] Then music with her silver sound --
[SHK] why 'silver sound why 'music with her silver
[SHK] sound What say you Simon Catling
[SHK] Marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound
[SHK] Pretty What say you Hugh Rebeck
[SHK] I say 'silver sound because musicians sound for silver
[SHK] Pretty too What say you James Soundpost
[SHK] Faith I know not what to say
[SHK] O I cry you mercy you are the singer I will say
[SHK] for you It is 'music with her silver sound
[SHK] because musicians have no gold for sounding
[SHK] 'Then music with her silver sound
[SHK] With speedy help doth lend redress
[SHK] What a pestilent knave is this same
[SHK] Hang him Jack Come we 'll in here tarry for the
[SHK] mourners and stay dinner
[SHK] If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
[SHK] My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
[SHK] My bosom 's lord sits lightly in his throne
[SHK] And all this day an unaccustom 'd spirit
[SHK] Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
[SHK] I dreamt my lady came and found me dead --
[SHK] Strange dream that gives a dead man leave
[SHK] to think --
[SHK] And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
[SHK] That I revived and was an emperor
[SHK] Ah me how sweet is love itself possess 'd
[SHK] When but love 's shadows are so rich in joy
[SHK] News from Verona -- How now Balthasar
[SHK] Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
[SHK] How doth my lady Is my father well
[SHK] How fares my Juliet that I ask again
[SHK] For nothing can be ill if she be well
[SHK] Then she is well and nothing can be ill
[SHK] Her body sleeps in Capel 's monument
[SHK] And her immortal part with angels lives
[SHK] I saw her laid low in her kindred 's vault
[SHK] And presently took post to tell it you
[SHK] O pardon me for bringing these ill news
[SHK] Since you did leave it for my office sir
[SHK] Is it even so then I defy you stars
[SHK] Thou know'st my lodging get me ink and paper
[SHK] And hire post-horses I will hence to-night
[SHK] I do beseech you sir have patience
[SHK] Your looks are pale and wild and do import
[SHK] Some misadventure
[SHK] Tush thou art deceived
[SHK] Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
[SHK] Hast thou no letters to me from the friar
[SHK] No my good lord
[SHK] No matter get thee gone
[SHK] And hire those horses I 'll be with thee straight
[SHK] Well Juliet I will lie with thee to-night
[SHK] Let 's see for means O mischief thou art swift
[SHK] To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
[SHK] I do remember an apothecary --
[SHK] And hereabouts he dwells -- which late I noted
[SHK] In tatter 'd weeds with overwhelming brows
[SHK] Culling of simples meagre were his looks
[SHK] Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
[SHK] And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
[SHK] An alligator stuff 'd and other skins
[SHK] Of ill-shaped fishes and about his shelves
[SHK] A beggarly account of empty boxes
[SHK] Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
[SHK] Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
[SHK] Were thinly scatter 'd to make up a show
[SHK] Noting this penury to myself I said
[SHK] 'An if a man did need a poison now
[SHK] Whose sale is present death in Mantua
[SHK] Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
[SHK] O this same thought did but forerun my need
[SHK] And this same needy man must sell it me
[SHK] As I remember this should be the house
[SHK] Being holiday the beggar 's shop is shut
[SHK] What ho apothecary
[SHK] Who calls so loud
[SHK] Come hither man I see that thou art poor
[SHK] Hold there is forty ducats let me have
[SHK] A dram of poison such soon-speeding gear
[SHK] As will disperse itself through all the veins
[SHK] That the life-weary taker may fall dead
[SHK] And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
[SHK] As violently as hasty powder fired
[SHK] Doth hurry from the fatal cannon 's womb
[SHK] Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua 's law
[SHK] Is death to any he that utters them
[SHK] Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
[SHK] And fear'st to die famine is in thy cheeks
[SHK] Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
[SHK] Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
[SHK] The world is not thy friend nor the world 's law
[SHK] The world affords no law to make thee rich
[SHK] Then be not poor but break it and take this
[SHK] My poverty but not my will consents
[SHK] I pay thy poverty and not thy will
[SHK] Put this in any liquid thing you will
[SHK] And drink it off and if you had the strength
[SHK] Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
[SHK] There is thy gold worse poison to men 's souls
[SHK] Doing more murders in this loathsome world
[SHK] Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
[SHK] I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
[SHK] Farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
[SHK] Come cordial and not poison go with me
[SHK] To Juliet 's grave for there must I use thee
[SHK] Holy Franciscan friar brother ho
[SHK] This same should be the voice of Friar John
[SHK] Welcome from Mantua what says Romeo
[SHK] Or if his mind be writ give me his letter
[SHK] Going to find a bare-foot brother out
[SHK] One of our order to associate me
[SHK] Here in this city visiting the sick
[SHK] And finding him the searchers of the town
[SHK] Suspecting that we both were in a house
[SHK] Where the infectious pestilence did reign
[SHK] Seal 'd up the doors and would not let us forth
[SHK] So that my speed to Mantua there was stay 'd
[SHK] Who bare my letter then to Romeo
[SHK] I could not send it -- here it is again --
[SHK] Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
[SHK] So fearful were they of infection
[SHK] Unhappy fortune by my brotherhood
[SHK] The letter was not nice but full of charge
[SHK] Of dear import and the neglecting it
[SHK] May do much danger Friar John go hence
[SHK] Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
[SHK] Unto my cell
[SHK] Brother I 'll go and bring it thee
[SHK] Now must I to the monument alone
[SHK] Within three hours will fair Juliet wake
[SHK] She will beshrew me much that Romeo
[SHK] Hath had no notice of these accidents
[SHK] But I will write again to Mantua
[SHK] And keep her at my cell till Romeo come
[SHK] Poor living corse closed in a dead man 's tomb
[SHK] Give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof
[SHK] Yet put it out for I would not be seen
[SHK] Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along
[SHK] Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
[SHK] So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
[SHK] Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
[SHK] But thou shalt hear it whistle then to me
[SHK] As signal that thou hear'st something approach
[SHK] Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go
[SHK] Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure
[SHK] Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew --
[SHK] O woe thy canopy is dust and stones --
[SHK] Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
[SHK] Or wanting that with tears distill 'd by moans
[SHK] The obsequies that I for thee will keep
[SHK] Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
[SHK] The boy gives warning something doth approach
[SHK] What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
[SHK] To cross my obsequies and true love 's rite
[SHK] What with a torch muffle me night awhile
[SHK] Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
[SHK] Hold take this letter early in the morning
[SHK] See thou deliver it to my lord and father
[SHK] Give me the light upon thy life I charge thee
[SHK] Whate'er thou hear'st or seest stand all aloof
[SHK] And do not interrupt me in my course
[SHK] Why I descend into this bed of death
[SHK] Is partly to behold my lady 's face
[SHK] But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
[SHK] A precious ring a ring that I must use
[SHK] In dear employment therefore hence be gone
[SHK] But if thou jealous dost return to pry
[SHK] In what I further shall intend to do
[SHK] By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
[SHK] And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
[SHK] The time and my intents are savage-wild
[SHK] More fierce and more inexorable far
[SHK] Than empty tigers or the roaring sea
[SHK] I will be gone sir and not trouble you
[SHK] So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
[SHK] Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
[SHK] His looks I fear and his intents I doubt
[SHK] Thou detestable maw thou womb of death
[SHK] Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth
[SHK] Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open
[SHK] And in despite I 'll cram thee with more food
[SHK] This is that banish 'd haughty Montague
[SHK] That murder 'd my love 's cousin with which grief
[SHK] It is supposed the fair creature died
[SHK] And here is come to do some villanous shame
[SHK] To the dead bodies I will apprehend him
[SHK] Stop thy unhallow 'd toil vile Montague
[SHK] Can vengeance be pursued further than death
[SHK] Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
[SHK] Obey and go with me for thou must die
[SHK] I must indeed and therefore came I hither
[SHK] Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
[SHK] Fly hence and leave me think upon these gone
[SHK] Let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
[SHK] Put not another sin upon my head
[SHK] By urging me to fury O be gone
[SHK] By heaven I love thee better than myself
[SHK] For I come hither arm 'd against myself
[SHK] Stay not be gone live and hereafter say
[SHK] A madman 's mercy bade thee run away
[SHK] I do defy thy conjurations
[SHK] And apprehend thee for a felon here
[SHK] Wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy
[SHK] O Lord they fight I will go call the watch
[SHK] O I am slain
[SHK] If thou be merciful
[SHK] Open the tomb lay me with Juliet
[SHK] In faith I will Let me peruse this face
[SHK] Mercutio 's kinsman noble County Paris
[SHK] What said my man when my betossed soul
[SHK] Did not attend him as we rode I think
[SHK] He told me Paris should have married Juliet
[SHK] Said he not so or did I dream it so
[SHK] Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet
[SHK] To think it was so O give me thy hand
[SHK] One writ with me in sour misfortune 's book
[SHK] I 'll bury thee in a triumphant grave
[SHK] A grave O no a lantern slaughter 'd youth
[SHK] For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
[SHK] This vault a feasting presence full of light
[SHK] Death lie thou there by a dead man interr 'd
[SHK] How oft when men are at the point of death
[SHK] Have they been merry which their keepers call
[SHK] A lightning before death O how may I
[SHK] Call this a lightning O my love my wife
[SHK] Death that hath suck 'd the honey of thy breath
[SHK] Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
[SHK] Thou art not conquer 'd beauty 's ensign yet
[SHK] Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
[SHK] And death 's pale flag is not advanced there
[SHK] Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
[SHK] O what more favour can I do to thee
[SHK] Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
[SHK] To sunder his that was thine enemy
[SHK] Forgive me cousin Ah dear Juliet
[SHK] Why art thou yet so fair shall I believe
[SHK] That unsubstantial death is amorous
[SHK] And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
[SHK] Thee here in dark to be his paramour
[SHK] For fear of that I still will stay with thee
[SHK] And never from this palace of dim night
[SHK] Depart again here here will I remain
[SHK] With worms that are thy chamber-maids O here
[SHK] Will I set up my everlasting rest
[SHK] And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
[SHK] From this world-wearied flesh Eyes look your last
[SHK] Arms take your last embrace and lips O you
[SHK] The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
[SHK] A dateless bargain to engrossing death
[SHK] Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
[SHK] Thou desperate pilot now at once run on
[SHK] The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark
[SHK] Here 's to my love
[SHK] O true apothecary
[SHK] Thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss I die
[SHK] Saint Francis be my speed how oft to-night
[SHK] Have my old feet stumbled at graves Who 's there
[SHK] Here 's one a friend and one that knows you well
[SHK] Bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend
[SHK] What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
[SHK] To grubs and eyeless skulls as I discern
[SHK] It burneth in the Capel 's monument
[SHK] It doth so holy sir and there 's my master
[SHK] One that you love
[SHK] Who is it
[SHK] Romeo
[SHK] How long hath he been there
[SHK] Full half an hour
[SHK] Go with me to the vault
[SHK] I dare not sir
[SHK] My master knows not but I am gone hence
[SHK] And fearfully did menace me with death
[SHK] If I did stay to look on his intents
[SHK] Stay then I 'll go alone Fear comes upon me
[SHK] O much I fear some ill unlucky thing
[SHK] As I did sleep under this yew-tree here
[SHK] I dreamt my master and another fought
[SHK] And that my master slew him
[SHK] Romeo
[SHK] Alack alack what blood is this which stains
[SHK] The stony entrance of this sepulchre
[SHK] What mean these masterless and gory swords
[SHK] To lie discolour 'd by this place of peace
[SHK] Romeo O pale Who else what Paris too
[SHK] And steep 'd in blood Ah what an unkind hour
[SHK] Is guilty of this lamentable chance
[SHK] The lady stirs
[SHK] O comfortable friar where is my lord
[SHK] I do remember well where I should be
[SHK] And there I am Where is my Romeo
[SHK] I hear some noise Lady come from that nest
[SHK] Of death contagion and unnatural sleep
[SHK] A greater power than we can contradict
[SHK] Hath thwarted our intents Come come away
[SHK] Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead
[SHK] And Paris too Come I 'll dispose of thee
[SHK] Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
[SHK] Stay not to question for the watch is coming
[SHK] Come go good Juliet
[SHK] I dare no longer stay
[SHK] Go get thee hence for I will not away
[SHK] What 's here a cup closed in my true love 's hand
[SHK] Poison I see hath been his timeless end
[SHK] O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop
[SHK] To help me after I will kiss thy lips
[SHK] Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
[SHK] To make die with a restorative
[SHK] Thy lips are warm
[SHK] Yea noise then I 'll be brief O happy dagger
[SHK] This is thy sheath
[SHK] there rust and let me die
[SHK] This is the place there where the torch doth burn
[SHK] The ground is bloody search about the churchyard
[SHK] Go some of you whoe'er you find attach
[SHK] Pitiful sight here lies the county slain
[SHK] And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
[SHK] Who here hath lain these two days buried
[SHK] Go tell the prince run to the Capulets
[SHK] Raise up the Montagues some others search
[SHK] We see the ground whereon these woes do lie
[SHK] But the true ground of all these piteous woes
[SHK] We can not without circumstance descry
[SHK] Here 's Romeo 's man we found him in the churchyard
[SHK] Hold him in safety till the prince come hither
[SHK] Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
[SHK] We took this mattock and this spade from him
[SHK] As he was coming from this churchyard side
[SHK] A great suspicion stay the friar too
[SHK] What misadventure is so early up
[SHK] That calls our person from our morning 's rest
[SHK] What should it be that they so shriek abroad
[SHK] The people in the street cry Romeo
[SHK] Some Juliet and some Paris and all run
[SHK] With open outcry toward our monument
[SHK] What fear is this which startles in our ears
[SHK] Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain
[SHK] And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before
[SHK] Warm and new kill 'd
[SHK] Search seek and know how this foul murder comes
[SHK] Here is a friar and slaughter 'd Romeo 's man
[SHK] With instruments upon them fit to open
[SHK] These dead men 's tombs
[SHK] O heavens O wife look how our daughter bleeds
[SHK] This dagger hath mista'en -- for lo his house
[SHK] Is empty on the back of Montague --
[SHK] And it mis-sheathed in my daughter 's bosom
[SHK] O me this sight of death is as a bell
[SHK] That warns my old age to a sepulchre
[SHK] Come Montague for thou art early up
[SHK] To see thy son and heir more early down
[SHK] Alas my liege my wife is dead to-night
[SHK] Grief of my son 's exile hath stopp 'd her breath
[SHK] What further woe conspires against mine age
[SHK] Look and thou shalt see
[SHK] O thou untaught what manners is in this
[SHK] To press before thy father to a grave
[SHK] Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
[SHK] Till we can clear these ambiguities
[SHK] And know their spring their head their
[SHK] true descent
[SHK] And then will I be general of your woes
[SHK] And lead you even to death meantime forbear
[SHK] And let mischance be slave to patience
[SHK] Bring forth the parties of suspicion
[SHK] I am the greatest able to do least
[SHK] Yet most suspected as the time and place
[SHK] Doth make against me of this direful murder
[SHK] And here I stand both to impeach and purge
[SHK] Myself condemned and myself excused
[SHK] Then say at once what thou dost know in this
[SHK] I will be brief for my short date of breath
[SHK] Is not so long as is a tedious tale
[SHK] Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
[SHK] And she there dead that Romeo 's faithful wife
[SHK] I married them and their stol'n marriage-day
[SHK] Was Tybalt 's dooms-day whose untimely death
[SHK] Banish 'd the new-made bridegroom from the city
[SHK] For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pined
[SHK] You to remove that siege of grief from her
[SHK] Betroth 'd and would have married her perforce
[SHK] To County Paris then comes she to me
[SHK] And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
[SHK] To rid her from this second marriage
[SHK] Or in my cell there would she kill herself
[SHK] Then gave I her so tutor 'd by my art
[SHK] A sleeping potion which so took effect
[SHK] As I intended for it wrought on her
[SHK] The form of death meantime I writ to Romeo
[SHK] That he should hither come as this dire night
[SHK] To help to take her from her borrow 'd grave
[SHK] Being the time the potion 's force should cease
[SHK] But he which bore my letter Friar John
[SHK] Was stay 'd by accident and yesternight
[SHK] Return 'd my letter back Then all alone
[SHK] At the prefixed hour of her waking
[SHK] Came I to take her from her kindred 's vault
[SHK] Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
[SHK] Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
[SHK] But when I came some minute ere the time
[SHK] Of her awaking here untimely lay
[SHK] The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
[SHK] She wakes and I entreated her come forth
[SHK] And bear this work of heaven with patience
[SHK] But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
[SHK] And she too desperate would not go with me
[SHK] But as it seems did violence on herself
[SHK] All this I know and to the marriage
[SHK] Her nurse is privy and if aught in this
[SHK] Miscarried by my fault let my old life
[SHK] Be sacrificed some hour before his time
[SHK] Unto the rigour of severest law
[SHK] We still have known thee for a holy man
[SHK] Where 's Romeo 's man what can he say in this
[SHK] I brought my master news of Juliet 's death
[SHK] And then in post he came from Mantua
[SHK] To this same place to this same monument
[SHK] This letter he early bid me give his father
[SHK] And threatened me with death going in the vault
[SHK] I departed not and left him there
[SHK] Give me the letter I will look on it
[SHK] Where is the county 's page that raised the watch
[SHK] Sirrah what made your master in this place
[SHK] He came with flowers to strew his lady 's grave
[SHK] And bid me stand aloof and so I did
[SHK] Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
[SHK] And by and by my master drew on him
[SHK] And then I ran away to call the watch
[SHK] This letter doth make good the friar 's words
[SHK] Their course of love the tidings of her death
[SHK] And here he writes that he did buy a poison
[SHK] Of a poor 'pothecary and therewithal
[SHK] Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
[SHK] Where be these enemies Capulet Montague
[SHK] See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
[SHK] That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
[SHK] And I for winking at your discords too
[SHK] Have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish 'd
[SHK] O brother Montague give me thy hand
[SHK] This is my daughter 's jointure for no more
[SHK] Can I demand
[SHK] But I can give thee more
[SHK] For I will raise her statue in pure gold
[SHK] That while Verona by that name is known
[SHK] There shall no figure at such rate be set
[SHK] As that of true and faithful Juliet
[SHK] As rich shall Romeo 's by his lady 's lie
[SHK] Poor sacrifices of our enmity
[SHK] A glooming peace this morning with it brings
[SHK] The sun for sorrow will not show his head
[SHK] Go hence to have more talk of these sad things
[SHK] Some shall be pardon 'd and some punished
[SHK] For never was a story of more woe
[SHK] Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
