You owe this strange intelligence or why
Give me my robe for I will go
Hath been but for a wayward son
Be lion-mettled proud and take no care
O Banquo Banquo
Why man he doth bestride the narrow world
Such harmony is in immortal souls
My good friends I 'll leave you till night you are
You can not better be employ 'd Bassanio
So do I his
As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth
Look how he makes to Caesar mark him
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
Marking the embarked traders on the flood
Or lose myself in dotage
Due to some single breast
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus death
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine
By his best arrow with the golden head
Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven
How he received you let me be resolved
fool no where but in 's own house Farewell
To see me pay his debt and then I care not
I faith I am sorry that thou art not well
By heaven you do me wrong
And others when the bagpipe sings i the nose
coming to offer you service
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him
Thou art thyself though not a Montague
O God I have an ill-divining soul
Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough
How long hath she been thus
God sir and he hath enough
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
Not to deny this imposition
Lord of his reason What though you fled
The time the place the torture O enforce it
time after your death you were better have a bad
After his death of all he dies possess 'd of
You will compel me then to read the will
She 's the worse for all this
Betroth 'd and would have married her perforce
His liberty is full of threats to all
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
The follower of so poor a gentleman
That Hermia should give answer of her choice
That thou couldst see my wars to-day and knew'st
Whom these things can not blemish -- yet must Antony
Blessed fig's-end the wine she drinks is made of
't was so indeed
Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
Four feasts are toward
He has no children All my pretty ones
Go hence good night and here stands all your state
As to expend your time with us awhile
Married to your good service stay till death
No by no means
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
And sure I am two men there are not living
money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in
I am glad 't is night you do not look on me
loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius
Hail Caesar and my lord hail most dear Caesar
Romeo
And that which most with you should safe my going
The morn is fair Good morrow general
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
Gratiano
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
Ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird
he why he hath a horse better than the
No not the hangman 's axe bear half the keenness
O look methinks I see my cousin 's ghost
My lord and you were then at Mantua --
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
And bade him follow so indeed he did
And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow 's eye
something where did I leave
It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may
If thou art privy to thy country 's fate
To be consorted with the humorous night
This is she --
Nay stare not masters it is true indeed
There is no world without Verona walls
And be all traitors that do so
Their dearest action in the tented field
So would I ha done by yonder sun
In troth I think thou wouldst not
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Of such misery doth she cut me off
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
What art thou fellow
For that same scrubbed boy the doctor 's clerk
Into the market-place there shall I try
When I spoke that I was ill-temper 'd too
I must be laugh 'd at
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
I 'll have no speaking I will have my bond
after a pestilent complete knave and the woman
In those freckles live their savours
But I have that within which passeth show
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
Would murder as it fell
Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth
I an itching palm
I doubt not of your wisdom
Silver 'd in the moon 's eclipse
He is afeard to come
And after scandal them or if you know
Which promises royal peril Trumpeters
Good madam hear me
This Lodovico is a proper man
I would not see't
The worthy thane of Ross
Good cheer Antonio What man courage yet
O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss
But in the cutting it if thou dost shed
Come gentle night come loving black-brow 'd night
Well
Suspicion of the deed
Against all rules of nature and must be driven
go near to make a man look sad
She 's so conjunctive to my life and soul
He 's married
Good morrow to thee welcome
I 'll send my prayers with him
I hope all will be well We must be patient but I
But we are spirits of another sort
The doors are broke
Go show your slaves how choleric you are
Demuring upon me But come come Antony --
Unto young Hamlet for upon my life
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
You must not stay here longer your dismission
And I will take thy word yet if thou swear'st
And the business you have broached here can not be
If love be blind love can not hit the mark
Nor spell nor charm
Do you perceive in all this noble company
I 'll prove the prettier fellow of the two
Is sum of something which to term in gross
To our proceeding bids me tell you this
What will you give us
The kings that have revolted and the soldier
To business with the king more than the scope
The death I gave him So again good night
Or on Diana 's altar to protest
Whip him Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
For this relief much thanks 't is bitter cold
Ay but the clerk that never means to do it
In my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
'But who O who had seen the mobled queen --
When we have mark 'd with blood those sleepy two
Both you and I for Romeo is exiled
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
For half thy wealth it is Antonio 's
'T is brief my lord
For I have need of many orisons
And worthy shameful cheque it were to stand
He swore had had neither motion guard nor eye
Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
Excellent i faith of the chameleon 's dish I eat
But 't is no matter thou shalt bring him to me
No none that thou hast wit enough to make
An honour were not I thine only nurse
Shake off this downy sleep death 's counterfeit
No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
To mend the petty present I will piece
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
The oppressor 's wrong the proud man 's contumely
I warrant you madam
that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for
God bless your worship
With one that saw him die who did report
That had in it a crannied hole or chink
If Cassius might have ruled
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
When he the ambitious Norway combated
And his opinion now I change my mind
That I might touch that cheek
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved --
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself
Good
How now my lord I will the king hear this piece of work
When it hoars ere it be spent
O where is Romeo saw you him to-day
Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew
My lord I shall reply amazedly
By any desperate change my more particular
Why he a harmless necessary cat
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
