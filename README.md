### Analysis of neural and non-neural network-based approaches to stylized text generation.
Abed Nassar, Novak Petrovic, and Sylvia Wan

## Main Task
Implement a system that works with natural language data, with the goal of testing some
hypothesis about language or language technology.

## Working Hypothesis
We believe that MC models will perform better in style replication tasks due to their basic statistical premises, 
whereas NN approaches may achieve better mimicry of NL as a whole,  but due to embedded language representations 
from pre-training, NN models may struggle to effectively “copy” a writing style.
