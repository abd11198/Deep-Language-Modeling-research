It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres
The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses e.g Garstung 1958
When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon
Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface
Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets
The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees
This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence
For the case of Jupiter the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components
Of the remaining planets only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources and not very much information is available
Mars has been observed twice at about 3-cm wave length and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars
The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin
No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported and because of their distances small diameters or low temperatures the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity
In spite of this the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years
The study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25-cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer 1946
This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett 1949
They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion
that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson 1930 and Pettit 1935
and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-1/2 days after Full Moon which is again in contrast to the infrared emission which reaches its maximum at Full Moon
Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves although opaque to infrared radiation
The infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase
Since the absorption of radio waves in rocklike material varies with wave length it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material
The radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 when Burke and Franklin 1955 identified the origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from Jupiter
This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke chap 13 and Gallet chap 14
Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 Mayer McCullough and Sloanaker 1958 A B C and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 Drake and Ewen 1958
In the relatively short time since these early observations Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 Aj
The observable characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity the polarization and the direction of arrival of the waves
The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc
This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk can not be resolved
It should be possible however to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers
Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth
There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation
The measurements made with the NRL 50-foot reflector which is altitude-azimuth-mounted would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized
Recent interferometer measurements Radhakrishnan and Roberts 1960 have shown the 960-mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk
Other than this very significant result most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation
The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets
The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet
The apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation
The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiates as a black body will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material
The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise
The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1-degree
At meter wave lengths an increase of the order of 10-degrees in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected
Therefore neglecting the extreme outbursts reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length range
Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm and the results are summarized in Table 1
Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques Sinton 1955 1956
see also chap 11
Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data and this together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures
In the observations at 4.3 mm Coates 1959 the diameter of the antenna beam 6'.7 was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases
These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions
Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it
These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude
Very recently observations have been made at 8-mm wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 Amenitskii Noskova and Salomonovich 1960
The constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates 1959 and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features
Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted
The observations of Mayer McCullough and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described
Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 1956 using the 50-foot reflector at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington
The half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9 and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes
The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured Mayer McCullough and Sloanaker 1958 so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known
The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible was found by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram to be 0.85
The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon 's disk is nearly uniform
The result of the observations is Af where the phase angle Q is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors
This result is plotted along with the 8.6-mm observations of Gibson 1958 in figure 1 A
The variation in the 3-cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much less than the variation in the 8.6-mm emission as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett 1949
In the discussion which follows the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component
The 10.3-cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 1958 using the 84-foot reflector at the Maryland Point Observatory of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory
The age of the moon was about 2 days
The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18'.5 and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon
Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas Argon
Thus the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc
It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 of the total arc energy
A detailed energy balance of the anode was established
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount
The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Aj
Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities
The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation
The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode
In free-burning electric arcs for instance approximately 90 of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere
In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50 of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode
The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs
In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat
The heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects 1
Heat of condensation work function plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode
This energy transfer depends on the current the temperature in the arc column the anode material and the conditions in the anode sheath
Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column
The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up Af
This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker Ref 1
The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode
Hence the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point
It is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode
The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions
however the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux
An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must therefore aim at a reduction of the anode loss
The following possibilities exist for achieving this 1
The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output
Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces
Feedback of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode
The third method was to our knowledge successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers Ref 2
The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage
Gas injection through a porous anode transpiration cooling not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself
A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper
Argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction
The anode material was porous graphite
Sintered porous metals should be usable in principle
However technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots
The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs
Thus direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators Ref 3
Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder
The cathode consisted of a 1/4 '' `` diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube
This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing
The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk
The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below
Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2
Argon was also blown at low velocities mass flow rate Af through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air
The anode consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug 1/4 inch long
The graphite was National Carbon NC 60 which has a porosity of 50 and an average pore size of 30
This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode
The anode plug Figure 2 was inserted into a carbon anode holder
A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas
It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet
A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts
This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection
Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 Pyrometer Instrument Co. Model 95 served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder
Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature
Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3
In this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant
To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder
In addition the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation
Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug
The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator
The power source was a commercial D. C. rectifier
At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V peak to peak with a resistive load
The current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter
The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders
Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation
A high frequency starter was used to start the arc
Experimental procedure and error analysis
Transpiration cooled anode with carbon anode holder
The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind
The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made
In order to reduce the number of variable parameters all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5 '' `` and a current of 100 Aj
The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between Af and Af
The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable
The upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature see below since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc
This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously
For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured
To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug the surface was scanned with a pyrometer
As it turned out a very hot region occurred on the plug
Its temperature was denoted by Af
The size of this hot region was estimated by eye
The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug
The mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug
It was denoted by Af
The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation Af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot
Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation Af whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as Af
This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures
The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was Af
The Af values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages
Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2
Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4
They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements
Thus the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates
The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of Af
This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned
It is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements
The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry
The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts
It was calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af
The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby Af
The temperature distribution of figure 4 gives Af for all blowing rates assuming Af
The temperature dependent value of ye was taken from Ref 7
The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to Af where Af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures Af and Af calculated analogously to equation 1
A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2
It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims
There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed
A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks
In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks
After it has reached terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded
By the use of various weights data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained
The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described
In this test a Af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of Af with a clearance of 0.002 '' `` on each side of the tape
This gives a rate of shear of Af
This however can only be considered approximate as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs
The face of one block contained a hole 1/16 '' `` in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure
Although there were only four fluids tested it was apparent that there were two distinct types
Two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure when undergoing shear and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two
Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid labeled 12,500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure
Although the tape was run for over 1 hr a steady state was not reached and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate
A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time
A back pressure was then introduced and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure
By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene molecular weight reported to be 770 was over half an atmosphere
The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand
The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300
These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight
The maximum suction was 3.25 '' `` of test fluid measured from the top of the block and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids
It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus
This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes
These experiments can be considered exploratory only
However they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper
They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures
Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies
The elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials
Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks paints adhesives molten plastics and bread dough for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length `` `` shortness `` `` spinnability `` etc which are usually judged by subjective methods at present
The actual change Af caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head
If the volume is the molal volume then Af is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists
Although the Af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects
Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of H referred to the same base as H and a cross-sectional area of A
If Af is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T and yr is the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is Af
Af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H
The total volume of the system above the reference height is Af and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H
The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero
This gives Af which is the pressure
This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium
This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields
The relation between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way
In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium referred to by some as thermostatics to the steady state
This can be justified thermodynamically in this case and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared
This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions ``
There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar
If the mechanics are similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar
The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear
Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear and as the rate of shear increases the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear
According to Philippoff the recoverable shear S is given by Af where yc is the angle of extinction
From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the Af calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face
There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields
These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one 's hands
These droplets appear to be ellipsoids and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are
If they are not ellipsoids the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation
The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids
Mason and Taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45-degrees at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear
Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear and some become asymptotic to it without breakup
This is of course a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies
The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume A The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop
B That because of the low viscosity of the fluid the internal pressure is the same in all directions
C The kinetic effects are negligible
D Since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid
These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear
Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is Af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is Af the pressure exerted by any curved surface is Af where yg is the interfacial tension and Af and Af are the two radii of curvature
This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason
If A is the major axis of an ellipsoid and B and C are the other two axes the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis Af and the difference in pressure along the A and B axes is Af
There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas
However there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate viscosity 155 poises suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok
This viscosity of the material in the drops is of course not negligible
Measurements on the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af
If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of cosec Af applies the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated
Its value was Af from the above data
This appears to be high as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops
It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation
The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume
In other words if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink
This means that work equals Q which in turn equals Af
There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that Af where zq is the probability that state i.e volume for an ideal gas could be reached by chance alone
This is known as conformational entropy
This conformational entropy is in this case equal to the usual entropy for there are no other changes or other energies involved
Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure
The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings
A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented
Af is paramagnetic and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening
The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Af gauss and temperature Af the asymmetry increases with increasing Af and decreasing T
An isotropic resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction
The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Af of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Af
The theory predicts a linear dependence of Af on Af where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant
The experimental second moment Af conforms to the relation Af in agreement with theory
Hence the electron paramagnetic effects slope can be separated from the nuclear effects intercept
The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes
The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei but the symmetry of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt
the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei
It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure
Af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters since it is a normal paramagnet with three unpaired electrons on the chromium its crystal structure is very simple and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong Af bond provides structural interest
We first discuss the Af bond in Af
We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment
Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects
The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the Af bond in Af
Af bond in Af
Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the Af bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid
Moreover it will be asymmetric until a certain critical Af distance is reached below which it will become symmetric
There is ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric
The Af distance in Af is 2.26 Aj
There is evidence though less convincing than for Af that the Af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric
Here the Af distance is 2.44 Aj
A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric Af bonds
Douglass has studied the crystal structure of Af by x-ray diffraction
He finds the structure contains an Af bond with the Af distance of Af
There is then the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data
Douglass found Af to be trigonal Laue symmetry Af with Af Af
X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of Af
The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry
Under this assumption the space group must be Af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell
This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric
Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af
These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms
The O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms
The Af layers are stacked normal to the 111 axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers
The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds
A drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6
The gross details of the structure appear reasonable
The structure appears to be unique among OOH compounds but is the same as that assumed by Af
The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal
However the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off Af but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent with Af at Af and Af at Af space group Af where Af represents the oxygens on one side of the Af layers and Af those on the other side
However any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short Af interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non-hydrogen-bonded Af interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 Aj
Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence
The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general rather than special positions along the 111 axis
If the Af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms 1 The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets
2 all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other
3 hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed either randomly or in an ordered way so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms
Position 2 appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds
A randomization of `` ups `` and `` downs `` is more likely than ordered `` ups `` and `` downs `` in position 3 since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also since ordered `` up `` and `` down `` implies a larger unit cell for which no evidence exists
Therefore the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically 1 or asymmetrically 3
Douglass prepared his sample of Af by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at 300 325-degrees-C
Dr. Douglass was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material
This material proved to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample
Subsequently we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af impurity
Since Af is ferromagnetic we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated Af would be suspect
Plane suggested another preparation of Af which we used here
500 ml of 1M aqueous Af with 1 Af added are heated in a bomb at 170-degrees-C for 48 hours
A very fine gray solid about 15 g is formed water-washed by centrifugation and dried at 110-degrees-C
Differential thermal analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340-degrees-C and a large endothermic reaction at 470-degrees-C
This latter reaction is in accord with the reported decomposition of Af
Thermogravimetric analysis showed a weight loss of 1.8 centered at 337-degrees-C and another weight loss of 10.8 at 463-degrees-C
The expected weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is 10.6
Mass spectrometric analysis of gases evolved upon heating to 410-degrees-C indicated nitrogen oxides and water vapor
The small reaction occurring at 337-degrees-C is probably caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than Af
All subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to 375-degrees-C for one hour
Emission spectra indicated Af calcium and all other impurities much lower
Chromium analysis gave 58.8 Cr as compared with 61.2 theory
However Af adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss
The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material taken with CuK ya radiation indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass
Magnetic analyses by R. G. Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities
Af was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of Af where Af
For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would be 3.10
An infrared spectrum obtained by H. A. Benesi and R. G. Snyder of this laboratory showed bands in the positions found by Jones
Electron microscopic examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3M in diameter
The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this
The x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater
We found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination
Nuclear magnetic resonance NMR measurements
The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model Af broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch electromagnet system
One measurement at 40 Mc/sec was obtained with the Varian model Af unit
A bridged-T type of bridge was used in the 10 16 Mc/sec range
The rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects
A modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality was used
Background spectra were obtained in all cases
The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal
A single value of the thermal relaxation time Af at room temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method
The value of Af estimated at 470 gauss was Af microseconds
A single measurement of the spin spin relaxation time Af was obtained at 10 Mc/sec by pulse methods
This measurement was obtained by W. Blumberg of the University of California Berkeley by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal
The value derived was 16 microseconds
Field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line defined as the field about which the first moment is zero
Second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration
Corrections were applied for modulation broadening apparatus background and field shift
Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 294-degrees-K
For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades
The temperature was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement usually about one hour
One sample which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375-degrees-C showed the presence of adsorbed water about 0.3 wt as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared due to broadening at low temperature
The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375-degrees-C which contain no adsorbed water
The measured powder density of the Af used here was about Af approximately one-third that of the crystal density Af
Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about Af
Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio of 4
The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical
Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube
The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary
Spectra were also obtained from a third sample of Af which had been diluted to three times its original volume with powdered anhydrous alundum Af
This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above
Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty spray-dried detergent formulations for household use
These widely advertised products which are used primarily for washing clothes are based on high-sudsing synthetic organic actives sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates and contain up to 50 by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate
In the household market there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder
light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder
and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules none of which are now nationally advertised
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder/active ratio
Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products 1 the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers and 2 the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders
In addition many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products
Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates
These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28
The cleaning process
Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces
Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium a solid substrate soil to be removed and the detergent or surface-active material
An oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved
One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of Af
In contrast a metal coupon Af in size would have a magnitude from 100,000 to a million less
Even here there is room for some variation for metal surfaces vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical reactivity
Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal depending upon surface roughness
There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning
Exclusive of esthetic values such as high- or low-foam level perfume content etc the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high
No matter how they are formulated a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application since they do not give adequate soil removal
This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation
A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings
whereas with a poor formulation the clothes exhibit a build-up of `` tattle-tale grey `` and dirty spots -- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash
Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents
Harris has indicated that two devices the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics
Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use
The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash
In this way numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance whiteness of the cloth swatches before and after washing
Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones
As is the case with the surface-active agent the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high
Large numbers of potential builders have been investigated but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice
The problems of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex
In hard-surface cleaning the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active
Indeed when the proper inorganic constituents are employed practically any wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation
Hydroxides orthophosphates borates carbonates and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners
In addition the polyphosphates are also used probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else
The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers
Physical chemistry of washing
Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces
The purpose of washing is obviously to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below 1
Dirt which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties
Greasy soils which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids
Stains which include the wide variety of nonparticulate materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object
Miscellaneous soils which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue
The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent
However a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of Van der Waal 's forces
This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles or to stick to an uncharged surface
Obviously if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or if one kind is charged and the other kind is not the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced
Likewise a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge
In addition dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids including liquid greases
Greases stains and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface
In most cases these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action
In an essentially static system an oil can not be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent
The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts to some extent as a dissolving and solvating agent
Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water
and natural waters in addition often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove
Therefore detergents are used
The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils
The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils
As is well known detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution
Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants including the soaps have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration
1 Below the critical micelle concentration monomers and some dimers are present
2 In the critical micelle region there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 80
3 For anionics these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups the ionized ends face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase
Obviously hydrophobic oleophilic substances such as greases oils or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase
Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold
Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process
Related to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil water interfaces in such a manner that the polar or ionized end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase
In the cleaning process sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant
Then during washing the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass with the aid of mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase
Obviously a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil
Substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases
This is particularly true of highly charged ions especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes
Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil water interfaces the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure see Table 26-2 on p. 1678
Thus for aqueous media we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent
From the equilibrium sorption data which are available it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt especially clay soils so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge
The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions
The negatively charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase
This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency
It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will be discussed later see pp 1746 1748
The crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as Af
The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale
Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation
Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil
It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe
Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic `` properties has gained widespread acceptance
In the over-all process it is difficult to assign a `` pure `` role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation
and indeed there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active
The thermal exchange of chlorine between Af and liquid Af is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above
The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Af
In the gas phase with Af of Af and Af of Af quantum yields of the order of Af have been observed at 85-degrees
Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction
It appears possible to set a lower limit of about Af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Af radical
The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions
Because of the simplicity of the molecules isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data
It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond
The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies
It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid
It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine
Furthermore the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high
also it would be expected that Af would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for Af radicals
Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents
We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride
-- Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a tube of resublimed Af into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid air
It was then distilled at least three times from a trap at -78-degrees to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation
The purified product was stored at -78-degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal
Of several methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory
To prepare the latter silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing Af obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
The silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of Af which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line
Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place
The radiochlorine was stored at -78-degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal
Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt low sulfur reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated with Af and Af and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches
The mixture was then extracted with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was distilled on a Vigreux column a 25 center cut being retained which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of Af
Purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal
This chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off
The required amount of carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line
The desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off
The contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking redistributed to the reaction tubes frozen down and each tube was then sealed off
The reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off
This method in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set
Reaction conditions and analysis
-- The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm i.d and about 15 cm long
In a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm i.d Pyrex tubing of 1 mm wall thickness
Both types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220-degrees
The photochemical reaction cells consisted of 10 mm i.d Pyrex tubing 5.5 cm long diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces
These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride
The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window
Two types of light source were used a thousand watt projection lamp and an AH6 high pressure mercury arc
The light was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell
Relative incident light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system
Changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell
Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20 aqueous sodium iodide solution
Carrier Af was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated cells containing gaseous reactants were immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide
After titration of the liberated Af with Af aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a solution-type Geiger tube
In the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments after emptying
The fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of Af in Af and Af
the thermal reaction
-- In studying the liquid phase thermal reaction some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared and analyzed
Experiments were done at 180 200 210 and 220-degrees
Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes
In addition to the method described in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a Af eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange of Af with molten Af
Calcium hydride was substituted for Af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride
No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found
The reaction rates observed at 200-degrees ranged from Af of the chlorine exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour
In most cases the chlorine concentration was about Af
Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour
No detectable reaction was found at room temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours
The liquid phase photochemical reaction
The liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange although still erratic
The improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold
Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings
Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85-degrees in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity
In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination
By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18 Af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases
It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine and considering the spectral distribution of the light source
These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65-degrees is of the order of magnitude of unity
When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated chlorine and phosgene were produced
Exchange was also observed in these cells which had chlorine present at Af
The photochemical exchange in the gas phase
-- Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate
Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table 1
In series 1 the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm
The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 14.7 cm distance calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity
Direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen
The Poynting-Robertson effect Robertson 1937
Wyatt and Whipple 1950 which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth
The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years
Whipple 1955 extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag
Further the corpuscular radiation i.e the solar-wind protons must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force
The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun
Also planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached
At one astronomical unit from the sun the Earth 's distance the dust orbits are probably nearly circular
If such is the case the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have relative to the Earth a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth
De Jager 1955 has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi-major axis
This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth
Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects there must be a continual replenishment otherwise micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space
There are several possible sources
According to Whipple 1955 cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun maintaining a fairly steady state
Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material
It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon
5.3 direct measurements of micrometeorite flux
One can not make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space
Even in the neighborhood of the Earth where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude
This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved
Beyond a few million kilometers from the Earth but still in the region of the Earth 's orbit a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable
At greater distances from the sun the situation is still less certain
There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment
Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors
In addition the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain
From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light an estimate of the particle sizes concentrations and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane
Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component
The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category
The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth
The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors essentially microphones and from wire gages
these instruments are installed on rockets satellites and space probes
Statistically the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha Explorer 1 1958 Delta 2 Sputnik 3 and 1959 Eta Vanguard 3
These vehicles with large sensitive areas have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure
Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information
The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af Dubin 1960
this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af
The data show daily and diurnal variations
Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude
One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth 's orbit
There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2 and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable
On May 15 a very large increase occurred with Af of mass between Af and Af
for the next two days the impact rate was Af
and for the next nine days the impact rate was less than Af Nazarova 1960
The data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux
Preliminary data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of Af for masses larger than Af for about 1000 events in a 22-day period LaGow and Alexander 1960
The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor of 4.5
The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations
Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large
If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements a mass-distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7/2 power of the radius
Space probes have yielded little information
Pioneer 1 recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours
With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones
Being based on so few events these results are of dubious validity
The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain
Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities
However one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship
In the United States most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces
The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor
This `` ejection `` momentum is linearly related to the particle energy
They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater
There is a difference in the experimental arrangement in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin
The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the U.S.S.R. work
The threshold mass of about Af corresponds to a 10-M-diameter sphere of density Af
However the conversion from mass to size is unreliable since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as Af
To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown
The velocity value used is also open to some question
if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth only about one third the above-mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass
Zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors
The diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity
The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data
A summary of meteorite data prepared by Whipple 1958 on the basis of photographic visual and radar evidence is given in Table 5-1
From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude meteorite the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude
The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density Af except for the smallest particles which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure
The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors
It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant
The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta
The figures in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth
hence these figures apply immediately above the Earth 's atmosphere
The unshielded flux is given in the last column
these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the Earth
Of course if there is a dust blanket around the Earth the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here
Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used
for example Jacchia 1948 derived a scale of 0.15 g for a Af zero-magnitude meteorite
The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light
The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known Cook and Whipple 1958
A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude Manning and Eshleman 1959
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites
The approximate equation is Af where N is the number of Af with electron line-density greater than or equal to Af and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite
Therefore N is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data
At the fifteenth magnitude Af and at the twenty-fifth magnitude Af
These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple 's table
The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons
The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region
The solar-electromagnetic- and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns
Also it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites Best 1960 and the same distribution would not be expected
Indirect indications of micrometeorite flux
A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions Pettersson 1960
Most meteoritic material by the time it reaches the Earth 's surface has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere
For all meteorites the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent
This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx
Present data indicate an accretion of about Af tons per year over the entire globe or about Af
Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man
It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development resulting in the production of BW weapons systems
Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals
Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon
The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect
The incubation period of infectious disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter
A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases
Thus an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities
An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area
This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials the pathogenesis of respiratory infections the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence
The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years
Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics
Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques
Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures
The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure through natural respiration to aerosolized organisms
The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated
The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence
Very small particles however in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs
This area is highly susceptible to infection
The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation
The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1
In considering BW defense it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect
For example bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air
There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne
Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface
It will rise during lapse conditions
There are of course certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met
Certain other properties of small particles in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract are noteworthy in defense considerations
The smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out
An aerosol of such small particles moreover diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas
There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens restaurants food stores hospitals etc
Depending on the organism there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products i.e in milk for example
The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense
Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials
In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological conditions
Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated
This material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment
Four hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 miles
Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial
The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles
From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was covered
These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case
The behavior of a biological aerosol on a much smaller scale is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism
An aqueous suspension of the spores of B. subtilis var niger generally known as Bacillus globigii was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles
A satisfactory cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns
In this test 130 gallons of a suspension having a count of Af organisms per ml or a total of approximately Af spores was aerosolized
The spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze
Spraying continued along a two-mile course
This operation was started at 5:00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes
There was a slight lapse condition a moderate fog and 100 per cent relative humidity
A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore
These were located at the homes of Government employees in Government Offices buildings and reservations within the trial area
A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first ninth and fifteenth floors of a Government office building
All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one which was operated for four hours
In this instance there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period a four-fold increase
This suggests that the sampling period particularly at the more distant locations should have been increased
As can be seen from Figure 2 an extensive area was covered by this aerosol
The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source
As can be seen from these dosage isopleths approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area sampled
It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered particularly downwind
The dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were Af
This was not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol
A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry
Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal
Botulinal toxin for example is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os
In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure making diagnosis difficult
In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit fever `` on a finger
An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious
Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category
An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements
It is obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property
In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction
Moreover it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable
An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population
A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized
It must be remembered however that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent
There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made
An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality
It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains
Mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification
All of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management
Biological agents are of course highly host-specific
They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives
This may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives
The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion
Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem
Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics
They then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated
They argue further and somewhat contradictorily that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease
This is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention
Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target
This of course does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease
A hypothetical example will illustrate this point
Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus Rickettsia prowazwki over City A and that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom
No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy
Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus
In this case then the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack
This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic
On the other hand a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy
One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack
The major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices
It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons
The same delivery vehicles -- whether they be airplanes submarines or guided missiles -- should be usable
If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city
Biological agents are moreover suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense
A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned
The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack
America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed precooked and even predigested foods
This is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage
One must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products
Huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack
A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies
These include low-temperature ethanol Cohn fractionation electrophoresis ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses
Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators
Abelson and Rawson using a stepwise elution scheme fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose
Speer and coworkers in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera used a series of gradients for elution from Aj
Fahey and Morrison used a single continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated yg-globulin samples
In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described
Materials and methods
Serum samples were obtained from normal group A group B and group O donors
Three of the anti-Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals
One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1 512 in saline
The second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1 256 in albumin and 1 2048 by the indirect Coombs test
The third containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies had titers of 1 256 in saline 1 512 in albumin and 1 1024 by the indirect Coombs test
In addition one serum was obtained from a donor R. E. who had been sensitized 6 years previously
This serum exhibited titers of 1 16 in albumin and 1 256 by the indirect Coombs test
These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous Af red cells
Serological technique
Anti-A and anti-B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods
One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2 suspension of group Af or group B red cells in a small Af test tube
In several instances group O cells were also used as controls
The red cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use
The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 Aj
The tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for agglutination
For the albumin method equal volumes of 30 bovine albumin sample and 2 cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 Aj
All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods
The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline albumin and indirect Coombs techniques
Homozygous and heterozygous Af cells Af and homozygous and heterozygous Af cells were used to test each sample
however in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous Af and homozygous Af cells will be presented here
The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37-degrees-C before centrifugation
The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner
The cells were washed three times with saline anti-human serum was added the cells were resuspended and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination
The anti-human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits
Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum `` type were selected for use in the present study
The red cells for the Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the Af cells which had been glycerolized and stored at -20-degrees-C for approximately 1 year
These cells were thawed at 37-degrees-C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions 20 18 10 8 4 and 2
The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2 in saline
Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr centrifuged and the serum was removed
The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes approximately 750 ml each of `` starting buffer ``
This buffer pH 8.6 was 0.005 M in Af and 0.039 M in tris hydroxymethyl -aminometha Tris
After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a Af cm column of EEAE-cellulose equilibrated with starting buffer
The DEAE-cellulose containing 0.78 mEq of N/g was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober 7 from powdered cellulose 100 230 mesh
The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer centrifuged resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity
The chromatography was done at 6-degrees-C using gradient elution essentially according to Sober and Peterson
The deep concave gradient employed fig 2 was obtained with a nine-chambered gradient elution device `` Varigrad `` reference 8 and has been described elsewhere
The other a shallow concave gradient Fig 1 was produced with a so-called `` cone-sphere `` apparatus the `` cone `` being a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask and the `` sphere `` a 2-liter round-bottom flask
Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer
in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer 0.50 M in both Af and Tris pH 4.1
A flow rate of 72 Af was used and 12 ml fractions were collected
Approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column
These were read at 280 m ym in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above
Paper electrophoresis
For protein identification fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5-degrees-C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline
During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2-degrees-C by surrounding the apparatus with ice
Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure it was used in all but the earliest experiments
Paper electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer pH 8.6 ionic strength 0.075 at room temperature on Whatman 3MM filter paper
Five milliamperes/cell were applied for 18 hr after which the strips were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using a Spinco Analytrol
When paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run/chamber under the conditions described above
At the end of the run the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried stained for 1 hr washed and dried while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at 1-degree-C
The unstained strips were then marked using the stained ones as a guide and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands
The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline and the eluates were tested for antibody activity
Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2 ionic strength 0.154
They were then centrifuged at 59,780 Pm for 35 to 80 min at 20-degrees-C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25
Sedimentation coefficients were computed as Af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the Schlieren patterns
For preparative ultracentrifugation fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline
Ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 125 to 150 min refrigeration being used throughout the run
Successive 1-ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe starting at the top of the tube and tested for agglutinin activity
Other methods will be described below
Experimental and results
The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity regardless of the blood group of the donor
With either of the gradients described chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at least three regions Figs 1 and 2 one of extremely low anionic binding capacity one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity
These have been labeled Regions 1 2 and 4 respectively in Fig 1
When the early part of the gradient was flattened either by using the gradient shown in Fig 2 or by allowing the `` cone-sphere `` gradient to become established more slowly Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas donors P. J. and R. S. Fig 1 and E. M. Fig 2
The latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak Region 1a between Regions 1 and 2
In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected Region 3 Fig 1
Moreover after concentration using negative pressure dialysis agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a donors P. J. D. A. and J. F. Fig 1
Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas
In all cases most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity
This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all
There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti-A and anti-B activity in group O serum though in two group O donors J. F. and E. M. only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity Figs 1 and 2
Several samples of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et al
These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity using fractions from group AB plasma as a control
As expected most of the activity was found in Fraction Af with slight activity seen in Fraction 4-1
A sample of Fraction Af from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig 2
Once again both anti-A and anti-B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis
Similarly both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate having extremely low low and high anionic binding capacity respectively Fig 3
Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide
The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram
the complete in the latter part
The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions Fig 1
In all cases the activity against Af cells was spread over a wider area than that with Af cells regardless of the type of test saline albumin indirect Coombs used for comparison
The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity
In fact agglutination of Af cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only `` incomplete antibody activity
This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera
when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detected
Apart from the honeybee practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor
Occasionally you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season when you are turning over sods in your garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all
They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt
I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens `` young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn
It is on them alone that the future of their race depends for all their relatives mothers husbands brothers and unmated sisters have perished with the arrival of the cold weather
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over falling prey to enemies or disease
The survivors emerge on some nice sunny day in March or April when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind
Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest or otherwise a good sloe tree or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom preferably one with male or staminate catkins
The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble honeybees bumblebees and other wild bees and also various kinds of flies
It is a happy buzzing crowd
Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers
It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green black-tipped little scale
By scrutinizing the flowers one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts
Those are the nectaries or honey glands Fig 26 page 74
The staminate willow catkins then provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen
a marvelous arrangement for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed
The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites
I will deal with these later on
Quite often honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins
As we have already seen in the first chapter bumblebees are bigger hairier and much more colorful than honeybees exhibiting various combinations of black yellow white and orange
Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game and let us just call them Bombus
There must be several dozen species in the United States alone
If you really insist on knowing their names an excellent book on the North American species is Bumblebees And Their Ways by O. E. Plath
If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep
As befits a queen a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting place
Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such as a deserted mouse nest a bird house or the hole made by a woodpecker
some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss
Once she has made up her mind the queen starts out by constructing in her chosen abode a small `` floor `` of dried grass or some woolly material
On this she builds an `` egg compartment `` or `` egg cell `` which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture called beebread
She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey
Then a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed
The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots
When the larvae hatch they feed on the beebread although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother
She continues to add to the pollen supply as needed
The larvae kept warm by the queen are full grown in about ten days
Each now makes a tough papery cocoon and pupates
After another two weeks the first young emerge four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying
The first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs
males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season
The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones probably because they are better fed
By the middle of the summer many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal `` and it is then that young queens begin to appear
Simultaneously males or drones are produced mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers although a few may be produced by the queen
The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter
It is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing for instance in August
The temperature then is still very high
At the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females
As a result the proportion of males which leave the nest increases and eventually the old colony will die out completely
The nest itself the structure that in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its peak is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths
Not always though does the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described
Some members of the bee family have become idlers social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives
Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus the `` cuckoo-bumblebee `` as it is called in some European countries
Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize
The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler Psithyrus lack the pollen baskets -- naturally
The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host
When she succeeds she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment
The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally
Thus the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread
Later on they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers
Worse still in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills the Bombus queen
But let us return after this gruesome interlude to our willow catkins in the spring
there are other wild bees that command our attention
It is almost certain that some of these usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees are andrenas or mining bees
There are about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone
One of my favorites is A. armata a species very common in England where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee
The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds
Almost equal in size to a honeybee A. armata is much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species a rich velvety rusty red
The males are much duller
After having mated an Andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil
The bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or `` cells `` each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread
The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults
But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer fall and winter
Their appearance next spring coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants
In the Sacramento valley in California for instance it has been observed that there was not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins
This must be due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and the animal
After the male and female andrenas have mated the cycle is repeated
Although Andrena is gregarious so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together we must still call it a solitary bee
Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species
After all social life in the group of the bees is by no means general although it certainly is a striking feature
On the basis of its life history we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees
The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect either
It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large number of long branched hairs on its legs on which the pollen grains will collect
Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind
Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees
Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains for example in Utah and central Washington
In the United States Department of Agriculture 's Yearbook Of Agriculture 1952 which is devoted entirely to insects George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females
Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart and the bee cities cover several acres
The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage
In most places there are two generations a year a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer
I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias
This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August when the bees are in their most active period
The name `` alkali bee `` indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places
Sometimes although by no means always these are indeed alkaline
The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist
yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either
They dislike dense vegetation
Where does one find such conditions
The best chance of course is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth
Many other probably nearly all snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length
Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes and Charles C. Carpenter 's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes Thamnophis show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults
Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length `` but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity
he was working with species of Java so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect
Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions
Additional records of slow growth have been omitted
It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves
There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths starting with the smallest boa constrictor and ending with the largest anaconda
Data on the former are scanty but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does indeed attain the greatest length
For four of the six the anaconda and the amethystine python can not be included for lack of data there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage
Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda
If in a certain part of the range it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other relatively large giants and reaches maturity at let us guess 18 inches longer than the others a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of nearly 40 feet
When it comes to rate of early growth the Indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years more or less
The African rock python a close second is followed in turn by the reticulate python
There are few data on the boa constrictor those for the anaconda are unconvincing and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python
It seems likely that the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently
it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep
I can not make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth
at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet
Until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions
It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity but this apparently is an overestimation
The best way to determine the correct figure in captives is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth a method that produced surprising results maturing of a male Indian python in less than two years his mate in less than three
data on the boa constrictor about match this
Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity
Results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations about three years are required there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required
Only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data
The following information on snakes varying greatly in size but all with less than a 10-foot maximum shows when considered with the foregoing that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature
Oliver in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers which I shall consider separately
These three were much alike lined snake Tropidoclonion one year and nine months
red-bellied snake Storeria two years
cottonmouth Ancistrodon two years
Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found
He concluded that in the southern species which are rapidly growing types females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three
Other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old and that the young may be born every other year rather than annually
Carpenter 's study showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two
Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions
Measurements of skins are of little value
every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer
In spite of all the pitfalls there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants
The anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment but the reason for this is not clear
the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical South America might be responsible
There are three levels on which to treat the subject
The first is the strictly scientific which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh
This approach rejects virtually all field measurements
The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced sensible conclusion
field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated
The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire
The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards
the mere piling up of testimony does not prove to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snakes joint snakes or ghosts
Oliver has recently used the second-level approach with the largest snakes and has come to these conclusions the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet the reticulate python 33 the African rock python 25 the amethystine python at least 22 the Indian python 20 and the boa constrictor 18-1/2
Bernard Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes but on the third level and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda
He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found some might be 38 and occasional `` monstrous freaks `` over 50
He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more
His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength but these seem to be given to complete his picture not to be believed
Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows
Growth of the six giants
Discussions of the giants one by one will include as far as possible data on these aspects of growth size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached
time required to reach maturity
rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage
and maximum length with confirmation or amplification of Oliver 's figures
Definite information on the growth of senile individuals is lacking
At birth this species varies considerably in size
A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield Zoo near Chicago ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches and averaged 29 inches
Lawrence E. Griffin gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas presumably members of a brood from `` South America ``
the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the Brookfield brood and its average
Raymond L. Ditmars had two broods that averaged 27 inches
R. R. Mole and F. W. Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries
William Beebe reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces this snake must have been emaciated for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British Guiana
In contrast Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches and four young were born in London at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces
Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces
A difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size
I have little information on the anaconda 's rate of growth
Hans Schweizer had one that increased from 19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years and J. J. Quelch records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years
It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate
In 1948 Afranio Do Amaral the noted Brazilian herpetologist wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes
He concluded that the anaconda 's maximum length is 12 or 13 perhaps 14 meters which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet 14 meters is slightly less than 46 feet
Thus his estimate lies between Oliver 's suggestion of at least 37 feet and the 50-foot `` monstrous freaks `` intimated by Heuvelmans
The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon a petroleum geologist of the Richmond Oil Company and reported in 1944 by Emmett R. Dunn
However as a field measurement it is open to question
Oliver 's 37-1/2 feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable
However many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet
It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area
In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies
Boa constrictor
A Colombian female 's brood of sixteen boa constrictors born in the Staten Island Zoo averaged 20 inches
This birth length seems to be typical
When some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected
The range is from 14 to 25 inches
the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central American female see chapter on Laying Brooding Hatching and Birth the latter on a `` normal `` newly born individual
However as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes these data must be taken tentatively
final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities
Alphonse R. Hoge 's measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male
I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity
Carl Kauffeld has written to me of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in March 1940
One female collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long
The female from Central America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long
What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate
unfortunately no one has kept complete records of one individual whereas many have been made for a very short period of time
The results are too varied to allow generalization
The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout
The pulmonary vein however without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship figs 8 22
Another marked difference is noted here
The pulmonary artery in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole the alveolar duct and the alveoli continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura fig 8
The bronchial artery except for a small number of short branches in the hilum contributes none of the pleural blood supply
It does as in type 1 supply the hilar lymph nodes the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the bronchi and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole
No bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group
Lung type 3 fig 3 is to some degree a composite of types 1 and 2
It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules
well defined but haphazardly arranged interlobular septa and a thick remarkably vascular pleura fig 9
The most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 being composed of numerous apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional poorly developed respiratory bronchioles figs 14 15
In this instance because of incomplete septation the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1
Air-drifts from one area to another are therefore conceivable
Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other as in type 1 fig 24
This relationship however is not maintained centrally
Here the pulmonary vein as in type 2 is noted to draw away from the bronchus and to follow a more direct independent course to the hilum figs 23 24
The bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals
As seen in types 1 and 2 it supplies the hilar lymph nodes vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles
As in type 1 it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen figs 9 10
This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches
Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once
Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface
With completion of filling net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches
An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted
This was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery
The diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum figs 16 23 24
In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery
This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed figs 17 18
Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted via the pleura
through the interlobular septa
and along the terminal bronchiole figs 14 17 18 19
One bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level fig 26
It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made
The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined
However the dynamics of airflow from morphologic considerations alone may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse
The volume and perhaps even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse
Also interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow
probably occur in the horse much as in the human being
and in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent Van Allen and Lindskog '31
A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present
Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and if one is permitted to speculate potential pathology should be included in this statement as well
For example the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate long alveolar ducts and short large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 and 3
One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse
In addition it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow considering its marked lobular development but conversely not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog
Anatomically the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others Birnbaum '54 in the human being
The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries
As early as 1858 Le Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings
In 1951 this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz
The opposition to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller '50
Apparently however Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study Loosli '38
Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat Miller '13
'25
The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear
However this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung
The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues
Theoretically they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air Ghoreyeb and Karsner '13 or from pulmonary arterial blood Comroe '58
Therefore an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue not primarily diffusing in nature in the region of the alveolus
If this be true the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema
One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 or 2
The presence of normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch and thereafter by many others
Nakamura '58 Verloop '48 Marchand Gilroy and Watson '50 Von Hayek '53 and Tobin '52 have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being
Miller '50 is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint
In criticism of the latter 's views his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level
As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure
Berry Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this
Our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards
It is distinctly possible therefore that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence uninjectable
This viewpoint is further supported by Verloop 's '48 demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves
In other words the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts
In addition little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses
Verloop '48
'49 found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats
Ellis Grindlay and Edwards '52 also were unable to find them in rats
Nakamura '58 was unable to demonstrate their existence either by anatomic or physiologic methods in dogs
The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred
Certainly the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species
It is however highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species especially the dog
In conclusion these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lungs
In addition a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent
Also for the present great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man
This is especially so if the dog cat or monkey are to be used in view of their marked anatomical differences from man
Finally it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species
The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented
A tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types
Type 1 is represented by the cow sheep and pig
type 2 by the dog cat and monkey
type 3 by the horse
Lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1
absent in type 2
imperfectly developed in type 3
The pleura and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 and 3
The pleura is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent
Arterial supply to the pleura in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery and in type 2 by the pulmonary artery
In types 1 2 and 3 the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole
In type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed
True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present
Well developed respiratory bronchioles on the other hand appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2
In type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum
This may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present
In type 3 this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2
Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1
First the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls
In contrast 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls are bunched and extend over a much shorter period approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls
The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence
Second for both sexes the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile
Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early Table 1 there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets
Third the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls a fact which confirms data for other groups of children
The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children
It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced `` `` moderate `` modal or `` delayed `` according to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots `` appeared to the left of upon or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line
When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line the `` moderate `` rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age
Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced `` or `` somewhat delayed `` as the case may be reserving `` moderate `` for dots upon or close to the mean
In the lower portion of each Chart the Skeletal Age Hand of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified
There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age `` for the Maturity Series boys and girls
The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation
Thus a child 's Skeletal Age `` dots `` may be classified as `` advanced `` when they appear above the middle curve `` moderate `` when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve and `` delayed `` when they appear below the lower curve
To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity Chart each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers
First the upper portion requires series of films for every child consisting of those from Hand Elbow Shoulder Knee and Foot
The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand
Second the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long short and round bones of the five regions
The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region
Third the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level Onset and Completion
The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion
Fourth the two indicators are for the most part widely separated chronologically with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center
The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood
Onsets Completions and Skeletal Ages Hand of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile
It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body
Accordingly maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart respectively should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence
It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings but there is substantial agreement
Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth from Elbow Shoulder Knee or Foot as well as Hand it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood
As stated earlier in the paper Onsets and Completions -- particularly the former -- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development each within a limited age period
Such an indicator or indicators are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress
It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2
As one approach to doing this Figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2
The differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows
The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 and for girl 2 in Figure 4
The numbering system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers
The `` dot `` on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child 's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center
The `` tip `` of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child 's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center
Thus the alignment of the `` dots `` and `` tips `` respectively indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls
The direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset
When the `` dot `` and `` tip `` coincide the classification used in this paper is `` Same schedule ``
The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables
The difference between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in Figures 3 and 4
This difference is readily clarified by referring to Table 1
For example arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4
For the boy this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion
Thus the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center 's ability to `` catch up `` in ossification is demonstrated
In contrast for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion
Obviously the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion
The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period
Length of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in Table 1
We have attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child -- more than 1700 values for the entire group -- by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center
Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center
Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix
The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix
One growth center in a short bone -- distal phalanx of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here primarily because epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage
Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth dietary patterns and health during adolescence
The following summary based on Figures 5 and 6 is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center
At the top of Figure 5 for example the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in Table 1
The 34 arrows denoting onset age plus completion age deviations have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls
The growth center depicted here in the distal phalanx of the second finger is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones
The mean onset age was 25.3 months Table 1 and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months
The correlation Table 2 between onset age and completion age was -.50 and that between onset age and Span was -.10
With due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement each arrow with a `` shaft length `` of four months or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule `` at Onset and Completion for this particular epiphysis
Accordingly girls 31 29 33 21 26 13 3 4 14 32 24 25 34 23 6 15 22 and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule `` at Onset and Completion
It seems clear from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls
Accordingly if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule ``
As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion
It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group
A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage
Boys 32 23 31 17 30 19 and 24 had `` same schedule `` at Onset and Completion
thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys
Boy 34 like girl 2 did not have `` same schedule ``
his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean
The `` dot `` on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip `` indicates relatively later Completion
After the 42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6 classifications of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them

This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems
In addition the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed Alexander 1959
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Af and then to Af as the active iodinating species
In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins chiefly thyroglobulin are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated
Iodination of tyrosine however is not enough for the synthesis of hormone
The mono- and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine
The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues Pitt-Rivers and James 1958
There is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control
The chemical nature of the iodocompounds is discussed below pp 76 et seq
Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin
Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in vitro been unequivocally proven
There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments Wolff Robbins and Rall 1959
Similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide
In addition depending on availability of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine
Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine cf Section C it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion
The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid
One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 McQuillan Stanley and Trikojus 1954
Alpers Robbins and Rall 1955
The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid glands from TSH-treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo
There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known
A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates Alpers Petermann and Rall 1956
Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes
A microsomal de-iodinase with a pH optimum of around 8 and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity has been identified in the thyroid Stanbury 1957
This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine
It is assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin
The thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream
It has been shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong
It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine-binding proteins which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine Ingbar and Freinkel 1957
Antithyroid drugs are of two general types
One type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoro type
This ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid
It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such
The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil
These drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism but they inhibit organification
The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin Astwood 1954
On the other hand there are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type such as resorcinol possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine
Any of the antithyroid drugs of either type if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism
The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of TSH causing the thyroid to enlarge
The effect of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet
The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type however are not antagonised by such means
Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods
The most conclusively identified is L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone which was isolated from rutabaga Greer 1950
It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family
There is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre particularly in Tasmania and Australia Clements and Wishart 1956
There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen which is then secreted in the milk
Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland
In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity Money Rall and Rawson 1952
Stanbury Brownell Riggs Perinetti Itoiz and Del Castillo 1954
In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 ymg per day
With lower levels thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine
Further the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally
In the presence of a low iodine intake thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with Af is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced
This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin
If the deficiency persists long enough it is reasonable to suppose that the Af label will reflect the Af distribution in the thyroglobulin
Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis
The thyroid-stimulating hormone
The name thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence
The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone
At the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated including release of iodine from the thyroid increase in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of Af
Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood
Brown 1959 has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject
Chemical constitution and physical properties of pituitary tsh
As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce 1851 that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid
This connection was clarified by Smith and Smith 1922 who showed that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles
The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later when Janssen and Loeser 1931 used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities
After their work other investigators applied salt-fractionation techniques to the problem as well as fractionation with organic solvents such as acetone
Albert 1949 has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period from 1931 to 1945 were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material
Much of this work has been reviewed by White 1944 and by Albert 1949
Developments up to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg 1958
In the last few years the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification Bates and Condliffe 1960
Pierce Carsten and Wynston 1960
The most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in potency composition and physical properties
Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood
First is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored
Second what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction
It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed rationally
The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients Adams 1958
Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH or is alternatively normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent can not be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary Aj
In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them
The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time
We should like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units
For the most part this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard
Standard preparations and units of thyroid-stimulating activity
The international unit u adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories Mussett and Perry 1955 has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International Standard Preparation
The international unit is equipotent with the USP unit adopted in 1952 which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the USP reference substance
Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use
Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups
The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia
Report of case
This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 1959 because of disabling weakness and general debility
In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period of 4 years
Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis `` suggestive of myelofibrosis
No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July 1957 in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily
This medication was continued until February 1958
In February 1958 the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated by pulmonary edema
Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans and cholelithiasis
The hemoglobin was 11.6 gm
Therapy included digitalization and anticoagulation
Later chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure
Because of increasing anemia triamcinolone 8 mg. daily was started on Feb. 23 1958 and was continued until July 1958
In September 1958 the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia
the hemoglobin was 10.6 gm
In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component triamcinolone 16 mg. daily was begun on Sept. 26 1958 and continued until Feb. 18 1959
At first the patient felt stronger and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm but on Oct. 20 1958 he complained of `` caving in `` in his knees
By Nov. 8 1958 weakness specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature was pronounced and a common complaint was `` difficulty in stepping up on to curbs ``
Prednisone 30 mg. daily was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov. 22 until Dec. 1 1958 without any improvement in the weakness
Serum potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq per liter and the hemoglobin was 13.9 gm By Dec. 1 1958 the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse and it became difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position
Triamcinolone 16 mg. daily was resumed and maintained until Feb. 18 1959
Chlorothiazide was omitted for a 2-week period but there was no change in the muscle weakness
At this time a detailed neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was moderate in the hands and feet but marked in the shoulders hips and pelvic girdle with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes
No fasciculations or sensory defects were found
Electromyography revealed no evidence of lower motor neuron disease
Thyroid function tests yielded normal results
The protein-bound iodine was 6.6 mg. and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was 46 in 24 hours with a conversion ratio of 12
A Schilling test demonstrated normal absorption of vitamin Af
In February 1959 during the second admission to The New York Hospital a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections
Serial serum potassium levels remained normal
the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was 10 units per ml per min
The clinical impression at this time was either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis
On Feb. 12 1959 purified corticotropin ACTH Gel 20 units daily intramuscularly was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention
From March 3 to May 1 1949 the patient was maintained on dexamethasone 3 to 6 mg. daily
In May 1959 prednisone 30 mg. daily replaced the dexamethasone
Muscle weakness did not improve and the patient needed first a cane then crutches
In spite of normal thyroid function tests a trial of propylthiouracil 400 mg. daily for one week was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness
Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted as well as fever malaise anorexia anxiety and an exacerbation of the anemia
These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism
Severe back pain in June 1959 prompted a third hospital admission
Extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of D8 was found
A high-protein diet calcium lactate supplements and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness
The terminal hospital admission on June 27 1959 was necessitated by continued weakness and debility complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids
X-ray films of the vertebral column showed progression of the demineralization
On July 4 1959 the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension went into shock and died
Findings at necropsy
The body was that of a well-developed somewhat debilitated white man weighing 108 lb
There were bilateral pterygia and arcus senilis and the mouth was edentulous
The heart weighed 510 gm and at the outflow tracts the left and right ventricles measured 19 and 3 mm respectively
The coronary arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses and the right coronary artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm distal to its origin
The myocardium of the posterior base of the left ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm area
The valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflets
Microscopically sections from the posterior base of the left ventricle of the heart showed several large areas of replacement of muscle by fibrous tissue
In addition other sections contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with neutrophils
Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large irregular basophilic nuclei
The intima of the larger coronary arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells
The intimal surface of the aorta was covered with confluent yellow-brown hard friable plaques along its entire course and there was a marked narrowing of the orifices of the large major visceral arteries
In particular the orifices of the right renal and celiac arteries were virtually occluded and both calcified common iliac arteries were completely occluded
The lungs weighed together 950 gm
On the surfaces of both lungs there were emphysematous blebs measuring up to 3 cm in diameter
The parenchyma was slightly hyperemic in the apex of the left lung and there were several firm gray fibrocalcific nodules measuring as large as 3 mm
Microscopically there was emphysema fibrosis and vascular congestion
Macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen in some of the alveoli and the intima of some of the small arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue
The firm red spleen weighed 410 gm and its surface was mottled by discrete small patches of white material
The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin
Some of the sinusoids contained large numbers of nucleated red cells and cells of the granulocytic series were found in small numbers
There were slight fibrosis and marked arteriolosclerosis
The liver weighed 2,090 gm was brown in color and the cut surface was mottled by irregular pale areas
Microscopically there was hyperemia of the central veins and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma
Some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin pigment
The gallbladder contained about 40 cc of green-brown bile and 3 smooth dark-green calculi measuring up to 1 cm in diameter
The mucosa of the stomach was atrophic and irregularly blackened over a 14 cm area
The small and large intestines were filled with gas and the jejunum was dilated to about 2 times its normal circumference
The small intestine and colon contained approximately 300 cc of foul-smelling sanguineous material and the mucosa throughout was hyperemic and mottled green-brown
A careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessels
Microscopically the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive cytolysis and contained large numbers of Gram-negative bacterial rods
The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils
The mucosa of the jejunum and ileum showed similar changes and in some areas the submucosa was edematous and contained considerable numbers of neutrophils
Some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi and there was extensive interstitial hemorrhage
A section of the colon revealed intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils
Cultures taken from the jejunum yielded Monilia albicans Pseudomonas pyocanea Aerobacter aerogenes and Streptococcus anhemolyticus
The kidneys were pale and weighed right 110 gm and left 230 gm
The surfaces were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear fluid-filled cysts measuring up to 3 cm in diameter
On the surface of the right kidney there were also 2 yellow firm friable raised areas measuring up to 2 cm in diameter
Microscopically both kidneys showed many small cortical scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells
Occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed with neutrophils
Throughout there were marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles
These changes were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left
In addition there were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney
The bone of the vertebral bodies ribs and sternum was soft and was easily compressed
The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty replacement
Microscopically there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity
The cells of the erythroid myeloid and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers
There was no evidence of fibrosis
The muscles of the extremities chest wall neck and abdominal wall were soft pale and atrophic
Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius pectoralis major transversus abdominis biceps brachii and diaphragm showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers
These changes were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in the pectoralis diaphragm and transversus
In the gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers such as that shown in Figure 2
Such swollen fibers were deeply eosinophilic contained a few pyknotic nuclei and showed loss of cross-striations obliteration of myofibrils and prominent vacuolization
The necrosis often involved only a portion of the length of a given fiber and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal
As shown in Figure 3 the protoplasm of other fibers was pale granular or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes
Inflammatory cells were strikingly absent
In association with these changes in the fibers there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei
These were increased both in number and in size contained prominent nucleoli and were distributed throughout the fiber Figs 2 5
In contrast to the nuclear changes described above another change in muscle nuclei was seen usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae
The nuclei of these fibers as is shown in Figures 3 and 4 showed remarkable proliferation and were closely approximated forming a chainlike structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber
Individual nuclei were usually oval to round though occasionally elongated and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic
At times clumps of 10 to 15 closely-packed nuclei were also observed
Occasionally there were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli Fig 5
These were thought to represent regenerating fibers
Trichrome stains failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles
In all of the sections examined the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal
Purification of the conjugates
In attempting to improve specificity of staining the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways 1 They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders Coons 1958 prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens E. F. Smith Townsend on sweet clover stems
2 The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems
The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Af in Af to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 saturation with Af
The precipitate was washed twice with an 80 saturated solution of Af dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen
3 In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade 1957
4 The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer PBS containing Af potassium phosphate and Af
Preparation of frozen sections
The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al 1951
Root and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen embedded in ice and cut at 3 6 ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees
The sections were mounted on cold slides smeared with Haupts adhesive Johansen 1940 in earlier experiments and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by Schramm and Rottger 1959
The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory
The sections were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30 minutes
until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks
indirect method
The sections were fixed in acetone for 15 minutes and dried at 37-degrees for 30 minutes
Some of them were then covered with a drop of Af in a moist chamber at 24-degrees for 30 40 minutes
As controls other sections were similarly covered with Aj
Sections were then washed with PBS for 15 30 minutes
After blotting out most of the saline around the sections a drop of Af was layered over each of the sections allowed to react for 30 minutes and then washed with PBS for 15 30 minutes
After blotting out most of the liquid around the sections the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine 7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of PBS
Direct method
After drying the sections under the fan fixing in acetone and drying at 37-degrees as in the indirect method the sections were treated with conjugated Af or Af undiluted unless mentioned otherwise for 5 30 minutes
As controls other sections were similarly treated with Af or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain of potato yellow-dwarf virus Wolcyrz and Black 1956
The sections were then washed with PBS for 15 30 minutes and mounted in buffered glycerine
Stained or unstained sections were examined under dark field illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp Osram HBO 200
The light beam from the lamp was filtered through a half-standard thickness Corning 1840 filter
In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light
A red filter Zeiss barrier filter with the code Schott designation BG 23 was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence
specificity of staining
indirect method
In the first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder
The intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder
Sections of sweet clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1 10 solution of Af for 30 minutes washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes stained with Af for 30 minutes and washed for 15 minutes in Aj
Such sections showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells of the pseudophloem tissue Lee and Black 1955
This specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive sections stained with 1 10 dilution of NS and Af or with Af alone
Unstained sections mounted in buffered glycerine or sections treated only with NS or Af did not show such green fluorescence
Sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained with either Af and Af or NS and Af also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence
However the nonspecific staining by the Af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen
Two absorptions of Af with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of Af which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride NS and Af with crown gall tissue powder or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining
Treatment of all the sera with sweet clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence especially when the treated conjugate was diluted to 1 2 with 0.85 saline
In all the above procedures when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1 10 or 1 100 with 0.85 saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced whereas a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 500 or diluting the Af to 1 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence
Rinsing the sections with PBS before layering the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction
In addition to other treatments treating the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layering Af did not reduce nonspecific staining
The only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate through a DEAE-cellulose column
When 1 ml of conjugate was passed through a column Af the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments and very little in others
In the latter cases an additional treatment of the DEAE-cellulose-treated Af with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the specificity
After these treatments the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining
With this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with 1 10 dilution of Af for 30 minutes washing with PBS for 15 minutes staining with Af for 30 minutes and washing with PBS for 15 minutes
The specificity of staining in WTV tumors with Af and Af but not with NS and Af or with antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus and Af and the absence of such staining in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained
Direct method
Af was first conjugated with 50 mg of FITC per gram of globulin
This conjugate was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method
In all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence
In later experiments Af and Af were prepared by conjugating 8 mg of FITC per gram of globulin
These conjugates Af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate with 50 mg FITC per gram of globulin while the specific staining was similar in both cases
Nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column as described for Af
The best staining procedure with this purified Af consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 minutes and washing in PBS for 15 minutes
The specificity of staining with Af was established as follows Af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover
Sections of tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus
After passing Af through DEAE-cellulose the titer of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 4 of the titer before such passage precipitin ring tests by R. F. Whitcomb
but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining
This indicates that increase in specificity of Af after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution
Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated Af and Af although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography
This was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells
The autofluorescence from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant
Distribution of virus antigen
Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors
The virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue
Frequently a few isolated thick-walled cells or rarely groups of such cells in the xylem region were also specifically stained but there was no such staining in epidermis cortex most xylem cells ray cells or pith
Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm
No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells
These areas are thought to represent the nuclei
In some tumor sections small spherical bodies possibly inclusion bodies Littau and Black 1952 stained more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen
In all cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of WTV antigen
In both the direct and indirect methods of staining the conjugates had nonspecifically staining fractions
In the indirect method this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with NS and Af or with Af only
In the direct method Af not further treated stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems nonspecifically and WTV tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable Af
After Af and Af were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present
Treatment of the conjugates with ethyl acetate and the conjugates which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride with mouse liver powder sweet clover crown gall tissue powder or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates
Such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems Coons 1958
Schramm and Rottger 1959 did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco mosaic virus
The reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known
In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder
The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled cells in the xylem region but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors
A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm
Wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation Black 1944
Brakke et al 1954
The concentration and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to infect plants
Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man in addition by complex symbols one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex
In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated
Moreover the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions
Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B but not a rabbit in emotional stress
A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism
In addition the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect `` demonstrates
But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex
MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain including the hypothalamus on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions
It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception memory imagination and creativity
Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response
The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper
Hypothalamic balance and its significance
After this brief discussion of neo- paleocortical and cortico-hypothalamic relations let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance
Facilitatory processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways
Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges
On the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored
Apparently a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex
Consequently if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level the lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges
Obviously a vicious cycle develops
This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways
It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism
Before we comment further on these pathological conditions we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness
Thus a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition
Moreover the dominance in parasympathetic action with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic at the hypothalamic level induces by its peripheral action the autonomic symptoms of sleep and by its action on the cortex a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system
With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus the opposite changes occur
Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus
Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals
Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect
Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance
The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs the latter the tranquilizers
Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as for instance between reserpine and chlorpromazine
Important as these differences are they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side we produce depressions whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and eventually maniclike changes
The emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner
synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drugs
The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance
Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges
They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side
This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test
Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm
Nevertheless the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients
The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions additional tests seem to be desirable
It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle
A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or in special circumstances to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting
In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs
The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic and also of sympathetic dominance remain to be elucidated
Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity
A state of parasympathetic `` tuning `` of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli but leads also to an autonomic reversal a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response
Furthermore conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning `` are observed
If for instance such a change is produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks previously inhibited conditioned reactions reappear
However if these procedures are applied more often conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished
In other studies loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive metrazol treatments suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes
It has further been shown that 1 an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance
2 drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions
3 in a state of depression the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing alerting effect on the Aj
These are few and seemingly disjointed data but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation pharmacological action or clinical processes
On the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy
The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion
If this is the case one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise
We pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms particularly in certain types of personality but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion `` abreaction `` may cure a battle neurosis
This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses
Being a strictly physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself
Wolpe 's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area
He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned conditioned reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed therefore that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible
An important observation of Pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means
In a conditioning experiment he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain
A mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding
The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion conditioned reflex
Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually it failed to evoke any signs of pain
Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding
Appropriate experiments showed that this is indeed possible
He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses
He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established
For the interpretation of these significant investigations it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions
The feeding-pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho- and ergotropic systems
Furthermore a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety
Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present different autonomic-somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety respectively as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines the state of the muscle tone and the Mecholyl test
The psychological incompatibility of these emotional states seems to be reflected in or based on this marked difference
In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems respectively
We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic-cortical discharge
Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems as a first approximation it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances in experimental and clinical neurosis and as the result of psychopharmacological agents
In view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes
The primary decomposition theorem
We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary
We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases i.e when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1
What can we do with the general T
If we try to study T using characteristic values we are confronted with two problems
First T may not have a single characteristic value
this is really a deficiency in the scalar field namely that it is not algebraically closed
Second even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V
This is clearly a deficiency in T
The second situation is illustrated by the operator T on Af F any field represented in the standard basis by Af
The characteristic polynomial for A is Af and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A or for T
Thus T is not diagonalizable
One sees that this happens because the null space of Af has dimension 1 only
On the other hand the null space of Af and the null space of Af together span V the former being the subspace spanned by Af and the latter the subspace spanned by Af and Af
This will be more or less our general method for the second problem
If remember this is an assumption the minimal polynomial for T decomposes Af where Af are distinct elements of F then we shall show that the space V is the direct sum of the null spaces of Af
The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which Af for each i
The theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial whether or not the primes which enter are all of first degree
The reader will find it helpful to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 and even more particularly to think of the proof of Theorem 10 a special case of this theorem
Theorem 12
primary decomposition theorem
Let T be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F
Let p be the minimal polynomial for T Af where the Af are distinct irreducible monic polynomials over F and the Af are positive integers
Let Af be the null space of Af
Then A Af
B each Af is invariant under T
C if Af is the operator induced on Af by T then the minimal polynomial for Af is Af
The idea of the proof is this
If the direct-sum decomposition A is valid how can we get hold of the projections Af associated with the decomposition
The projection Af will be the identity on Af and zero on the other Af
We shall find a polynomial Af such that Af is the identity on Af and is zero on the other Af and so that Af etc
For each i let Af
Since Af are distinct prime polynomials the polynomials Af are relatively prime Theorem 8 Chapter 4
Thus there are polynomials Af such that Af
Note also that if Af then Af is divisible by the polynomial p because Af contains each Af as a factor
We shall show that the polynomials Af behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof
Let Af
Since Af and P divides Af for Af we have Af
Thus the Af are projections which correspond to some direct-sum decomposition of the space V
We wish to show that the range of Af is exactly the subspace Af
It is clear that each vector in the range of Af is in Af for if ya is in the range of Af then Af and so Af because Af is divisible by the minimal polynomial P
Conversely suppose that ya is in the null space of Af
If Af then Af is divisible by Af and so Af i.e Af
But then it is immediate that Af i.e that ya is in the range of Af
This completes the proof of statement A
It is certainly clear that the subspaces Af are invariant under T
If Af is the operator induced on Af by T then evidently Af because by definition Af is 0 on the subspace Af
This shows that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af
Conversely let G be any polynomial such that Af
Then Af
Thus Af is divisible by the minimal polynomial P of T i.e Af divides Af
It is easily seen that Af divides G
Hence the minimal polynomial for Af is Af
If Af are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of T then each Af is a polynomial in T and accordingly if a linear operator U commutes with T then U commutes with each of the Af i.e each subspace Af is invariant under U
In the notation of the proof of Theorem 12 let us take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for T is a product of first-degree polynomials i.e the case in which each Af is of the form Af
Now the range of Af is the null space Af of Af
Let us put Af
By Theorem 10 D is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of T
Let us look at the operator Af
Now Af Af so Af
The reader should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that Af and in general that Af
When Af for each i we shall have Af because the operator Af will then be 0 on the range of Af
Let N be a linear operator on the vector space V
We say that N is nilpotent if there is some positive integer R such that Af
Theorem 13
Let T be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F
Suppose that the minimal polynomial for T decomposes over F into a product of linear polynomials
Then there is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N in V such that A Af b Af
The diagonalizable operator D and the nilpotent operator N are uniquely determined by A and B and each of them is a polynomial in T
We have just observed that we can write Af where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T
Now suppose that we also have Af where D is diagonalizable N is nilpotent and Af
We shall prove that Af
Since D and N commute with one another and Af we see that D and N commute with T
Thus D and N commute with any polynomial in T
hence they commute with D and with N
Now we have Af or Af and all four of these operators commute with one another
Since D and D are both diagonalizable and they commute they are simultaneously diagonalizable and Af is diagonalizable
Since N and N are both nilpotent and they commute the operator Af is nilpotent
for using the fact that N and N commute Af and so when R is sufficiently large every term in this expression for Af will be 0
Actually a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its T power 0
if we take Af above that will be large enough
It then follows that Af is large enough but this is not obvious from the above expression
Now Af is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent
Such an operator is obviously the zero operator
for since it is nilpotent the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form Af for some Af
but then since the operator is diagonalizable the minimal polynomial can not have a repeated root
hence Af and the minimal polynomial is simply x which says the operator is 0
Thus we see that Af and Af
Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field F e.g the field of complex numbers
Then every linear operator T in V can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute
These operators D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T
From these results one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators
For vector spaces over non-algebraically closed fields we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors
It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter
In concluding this section we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem
We have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear algebra
Example 11
In the primary decomposition theorem it is not necessary that the vector space V be finite dimensional nor is it necessary for parts A and B that P be the minimal polynomial for T
If T is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic polynomial P such that Af then parts A and B of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave
Let N be a positive integer and let V be the space of all N times continuously differentiable functions F on the real line which satisfy the differential equation Af where Af are some fixed constants
If Af denotes the space of N times continuously differentiable functions then the space V of solutions of this differential equation is a subspace of Af
If D denotes the differentiation operator and P is the polynomial Af then V is the null space of the operator p because Af simply says Af
Let us now regard D as a linear operator on the subspace V
Then Af
If we are discussing differentiable complex-valued functions then Af and V are complex vector spaces and Af may be any complex numbers
We now write Af where Af are distinct complex numbers
If Af is the null space of Af then Theorem 12 says that Af
In other words if F satisfies the differential equation Af then F is uniquely expressible in the form Af where Af satisfies the differential equation Af
Thus the study of the solutions to the equation Af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form Af
This reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra i.e by the primary decomposition theorem
To describe the space of solutions to Af one must know something about differential equations
that is one must know something about D other than the fact that it is a linear operator
However one does not need to know very much
It is very easy to establish by induction on R that if F is in Af then Af
that is Af etc
Thus Af if and only if Af
A function G such that Af i.e Af must be a polynomial function of degree Af or less Af
Thus F satisfies Af if and only if F has the form Af
Accordingly the functions Af span the space of solutions of Af
Since Af are linearly independent functions and the exponential function has no zeros these R functions Af form a basis for the space of solutions
Examples of binomial experiments
Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials each with two possible outcomes
The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another
We devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models
We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments
Marksmanship example
A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target all under practically the same conditions may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times
In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary
What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes
Inheritance in mice
In litters of eight mice from similar parents the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8
What probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes
Aces ones with three dice
When three dice are tossed repeatedly what is the probability that the number of aces is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3
General binomial problem
More generally suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials that each trial results in either a `` success `` or a `` non-success `` `` failure `` and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial
In the examples above the occurrence of a bull's-eye a straight-haired mouse or an ace could be called a `` success ``
In general any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success ``
The major question in this chapter is What is the probability of exactly X successes in N trials
In Chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples usually by counting points in a sample space
Fortunately a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind
Before deriving this formula we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind ``
Experiments are often composed of several identical trials and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated
In the marksmanship example a trial consists of `` one round shot at a target `` with outcome either one bull's-eye success or none failure
Further an experiment might consist of five rounds and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed of several repetitions of the five-round experiment
If three dice are tossed a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials
Or what amounts to the same thing if one die is tossed three times each toss is a trial and the three tosses form the experiment
Mathematically we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times
These examples are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial `` and `` experiment `` as they are used in this chapter but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly
Example 1
Student football managers
Ten students act as managers for a high-school football team and of these managers a proportion P are licensed drivers
Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck
On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver
Considering only these Fridays what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times
Exactly 2 times
1 time
0 times
Note that there are 3 trials of interest
Each trial consists of choosing a student manager at random
The 2 possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver `` or `` nondriver ``
Since the choice is by lot each week the outcomes of different trials are independent
The managers stay the same so that Af is the same for all weeks
We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments
For an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment it must have four properties 1 there must be a fixed number of trials 2 each trial must result in a `` success `` or a `` failure `` a binomial trial 3 all trials must have identical probabilities of success 4 the trials must be independent of each other
Below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties
We also give for each property an example where the property is absent
The language and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter
There must be a fixed number n of repeated trials
For the marksman we study sets of five shots Af
for the mice we restrict attention to litters of eight Af
and for the aces we toss three dice Af
Experiment without a fixed number of trials
Toss a die until an ace appears
Here the number of trials is a random variable not a fixed number
Binomial trials
Each of the N trials is either a success or a failure
`` Success `` and `` failure `` are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general
These words are more expressive than labels like `` A `` and `` not-A ``
It is natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse
The word `` binomial `` means `` of two names `` or `` of two terms `` and both usages apply in our work the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial and the second to the terms P and Af that represent the probabilities of `` success `` and `` failure ``
Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial we group these outcomes into two classes as in the example of the die where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace `` and `` not-ace ``
Experiment without the two-class property
We classify mice as `` straight-haired `` or `` wavy-haired `` but a hairless mouse appears
We can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not constituting a trial but such a solution is not always satisfactory
All trials have identical probabilities of success
Each die has probability Af of producing an ace
the marksman has some probability p perhaps 0.1 of making a bull's-eye
Note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment to be binomial
Experiment where p is not constant
During a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman lowering his chance of a bull's-eye
The trials are independent
Strictly speaking this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials
Thus in the three-dice example Af Af and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace not-ace ace in that order is Af
Experimentally we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another
Examples where independence fails
A family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains and a coin is tossed to decide
We want to know the number of people going to the mountains
When this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials one for each member of the family the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent
Indeed the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family
The following is a less extreme example of dependence
Consider couples visiting an art museum
Each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize
Voting for one picture may be called `` success `` for the other `` failure ``
An experiment consists of the voting of one couple or two trials
In repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors
Table 7-1 illustrates the point
The table shows that 0.6 of the boys and 0.6 of the girls vote for picture A
Therefore under independent voting Af or 0.36 of the couples would cast two votes for picture A and Af or 0.16 would cast two votes for picture B
Thus in independent voting Af or 0.52 of the couples would agree
But Table 7-1 shows that Af or 0.70 agree too many for independent voting
Each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through N as the value of the random variable X where Af
We want to study the probability function of this random variable
For example we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes not which shots were bull's-eyes
A binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes
For example the marksman gets 5 shots but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye that is 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 if he gets no bull's-eye
Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes and the random variable is not the number of successes
The constancy of P and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice
Obviously very slight changes in P do not change the probabilities much and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference
For instance see Example 2 of Section 5-5 on red cards in hands of 5
On the other hand even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes
that is we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model
To summarize
A binomial experiment consists of Af independent binomial trials all with the same probability Af of yielding a success
The outcome of the experiment is X successes
The random variable X takes the values Af with probabilities Af or more briefly Af
We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly X successes for given values of P and N
When each number of successes X is paired with its probability of occurrence Af the set of pairs Af is a probability function called a binomial distribution
The choice of P and N determines the binomial distribution uniquely and different choices always produce different distributions except when Af
then the number of successes is always 0
The set of all binomial distributions is called the family of binomial distributions but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to `` the binomial distribution `` or even `` the binomial `` when the context is clear
Binomial distributions were treated by James Bernoulli about 1700 and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials
Random variables
Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success
Therefore each binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 with probabilities Q and P respectively
The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable X the total number of successes which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials
Example 2
The marksman gets two bull's-eyes one on his third shot and one on his fifth
The numbers of successes on the five individual shots are then 0 0 1 0 1
The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 and there are 5 such random variables here
Their sum is X the total number of successes which in this experiment has the value Af
Consider a simple closed plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle and which is given by Af
These are real analytic periodic functions with period T
In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares
This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed bounded convex set in Af
The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo and Cairns to show that in Af there are families of such cubes
Here for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results
A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C
Indeed the spiral Af with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square
The square has one corner point on the straight line segment and does not lie entirely in the interior
On C from the point P at Af to the point Q at Af we construct the chord and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C
As S increases we consider the two free corner points of the square Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively
As S approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both Af and Af must cross C an odd number of times as S varies from zero to T
The points may also touch C without crossing
Suppose Af crosses C when Af
We now have certain squares with three corners on C
For any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square
Each point on C as a vertex may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction
To each paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point i.e the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing T
If the vertex is at Af and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90-degrees about the vertex
The set of intersections of Af the rotated curve with the original curve C consists of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at Af plus the vertex itself
We note that two such curves C and Af can not coincide at more than a finite number of points
otherwise being analytic they would coincide at all points which is impossible since they do not coincide near Af
With each vertex we associate certain numerical values namely the set of positive differences in the parameter T between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points
For the vertex at Af these values will be denoted by Af
The function f t defined in this way is multi-valued
We consider now the graph of the function f t on Af
We will refer to the plane of C and Af as the C-plane and to the plane of the graph as the Aj
The graph as a set may have a finite number of components
We will denote the values of f t on different components by Af
Each point with abscissa T on the graph represents an intersection between C and Af
There are two types of such intersections depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection
An ordinary point will be any point of intersection A such that in every neighborhood of A in the C-plane Af meets both the interior and the exterior of C
Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point
This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj
We can now prove several lemmas
Lemma 1
In some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph the function f is a single-valued continuous function
We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood
With the vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and Af
In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af
We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic
In the C-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian coordinates u V with the origin at Q and such that both C and Af have finite slope at Q
Near Q both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U
In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued analytic function of U
Furthermore one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is monotone for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval
Now to find Af one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q
But Af is just the curve Af translated without rotation through a small arc for Af is always obtained by rotating C through exactly 90-degrees
The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve
Thus if E is sufficiently small there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function
Therefore Af is single-valued near Q
It is also seen that Af since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation
Thus Af is also continuous at Af and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point
We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph
This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals
The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 namely that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point
This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points
Lemma 2
In some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane say Af the function Af is either double-valued or has no values defined except at the tangent point itself where it is single-valued
A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another
A continuous change in T through an amount E results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve Af
There are three possibilities A Af remains tangent to C as it is translated
B Af moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for Af
C Af cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every T in Af
The first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the f-plane the end points of which fall into category B or C
In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af
In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval
The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af
Again the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist
In the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued or no-valued on one side and is a single-valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side
With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F
First for any value of T for which all values of f t are ordinary points the number of values of f t must be odd
For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and Af must be even otherwise starting in the interior of C Af could not finally return to the interior and the center of rotation at T is the argument of the function not a value
Therefore for any value of T the number of values of f t is equal to the finite number of tangent points corresponding to the argument T plus an odd number
The number of ordinary values of the function f t at T will be called its multiplicity at T
Lemma 3
The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj
We suppose not
Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval
Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af
Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane
otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points
Further we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of F can only change at a tangent point and at such a point can only change by an even integer
Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number
This is true of all components which have such a bounded support
But this is a contradiction for we know that the multiplicity of f t is odd for every T
We have shown that the graph of F contains at least one component whose inverse is the entire interval 0 T and whose multiplicity is odd
There must be an odd number of such components which will be called complete components
The remaining incomplete components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument and are defined only on a proper sub-interval of Aj
We must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C
We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C
We erect a square with PQ as a side and with free corners Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively
As S varies from zero to T the values of S for which Af and Af cross C will be denoted by Af and Af respectively
We have Af plus tangent points
These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af
Lemma 4
The values Af are the ordinary values at Af of a multi-valued function g t which has components corresponding to those of f t
We first define a function b t as follows given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t b t is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between T and the backward corner points
The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T
Now with P fixed at Af Af-values occur when the corner Af crosses C and are among the values of S such that Af
The roots of this equation are just the ordinates of the intersections of the graph of B with a straight line of unit slope through Af in the b-plane the plane of the graph of b
We define these values as Af and define g t in the same way for each T
Thus we obtain g t by introducing an oblique g t -axis in the Aj
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers
These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Af
Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that A It has no complex of invariant lines and B Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve is necessarily of the type discussed in 1
No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible
Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Af and Af and let zg be a Af curve of order K on Q
A general line L meets Q in two points Af and Af through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus Af whose lines are simple secants of Aj
On these generators let Af and Af be respectively the harmonic conjugates of Af and Af with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets Aj
The line Af is the image of L
Clearly the transformation is involutorial
We observe first that no line l can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q
For if it did the plane of L and l would contain two generators of Af which is impossible
Moreover from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of Af it is clear that the only points of Q at which a line can meet its image are the points of Aj
Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj
The invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of zg since each of these meets Q in two points which are invariant
The order of this congruence is Af since Af secants of a curve of symbol B on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point
The class of the congruence is Af since an arbitrary plane meets zg in K points
Since the complex of singular lines is of order K and since there is no complex of invariant lines it follows from the formula Af that the order of the involution is Af
There are various sets of exceptional lines or lines whose images are not unique
The most obvious of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to Q each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line
Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents
It is interesting that a 1 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such pencils so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent
For the lines of any plane yp meeting Q in a conic C are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve C into which C is transformed in the point involution on Q
In particular tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C
Moreover if Af and Af are two planes intersecting in a line l tangent to Q at a point P the two free intersections of the image curves Af and Af must coincide at P the image of P and at this point Af and Af must have a common tangent l
Hence thought of as a line in a particular plane yp any tangent to Q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through L
Each generator yl of Af is also exceptional for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point involution on Q
This curve is of symbol Af since it meets yl and hence every line of Af in the Af invariant points on yl and since it obviously meets every line of Af in a single point
The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af
A final class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations Since no two generators of Af can intersect it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections
In other words these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all
Now the only way in which all curves of the image family of Af can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of Af which is not a secant but a tangent of zg for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of tangency
Since two curves of symbol Af on Q intersect in Af points it follows that there are Af lines of Af which are tangent to Aj
Clearly any line l of any bundle having one of these points of tangency T as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of L and Q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of Af which is tangent to zg at T
A line through two of these points Af and Af will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the tangents to zg at Af and Af as directrices
A conic C being a 1 1 curve on Q meets the image of any line of Af which we have already found to be a Af curve on Q in Af points
Hence its image C meets any line of Af in Af points
Moreover C obviously meets any line Af in a single point
Hence C is a Af curve on Q
Therefore the congruence of its secants that is the image of a general plane field of lines is of order Af and class Af
Finally the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines namely Af and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines namely Af
The preceding observations make it clear that there exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve Aj
We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described
To do this we must first show that every line which meets zg in a point P meets its image at P
To see this consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj
By 1 the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order Af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve C of order Af
On C there is a Af correspondence in which the Af points cut from C by a general line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of L and the plane of the pencil
Since C is rational this correspondence has K coincidences each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image
However since the pencil contains a secant of zg it actually contains only Af singular lines
To avoid this contradiction it is necessary that C be composite with the secant of zg and a curve of order Af as components
Thus it follows that the secants of zg are all invariant
But if this is the case then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point P of zg as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order Af having Af generators concurrent at P
Since a ruled surface of order N with N concurrent generators is necessarily a cone it follows finally that every line through a point P of zg meets its image at P as asserted
Now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex P on zg which is effected by the involution as a whole
From the preceding remarks it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion
Moreover in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order Af namely the cone of secants of zg which pass through P
Hence it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective De Jonquieres involution of order Af and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either Af or Af
The first possibility requires that there be a line through P which meets zg in Af points
the second requires that there be a line through P which meets zg in Af points
In each case lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant
In the first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the vertex P to the intersection of zg and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant
In the second the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex P to the two intersections of zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant
The multiple secants of course are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af
Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj
Hence zg must have either a regulus of Af-fold secants or a regulus of Af-fold secants
Moreover if Af no two of the multiple secants can intersect
For if such were the case either the plane of the two lines would meet zg in more than K points or alternatively the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high
But if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of zg can intersect then the regulus must be quadratic or in other words zg must be either a Af or a Af curve on a nonsingular quadric surface
We now observe that the case in which zg is a Af curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet Aj
For any pencil in a plane containing a Af-fold secant of zg has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in Af lines namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of zg and the multiple secant plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil
However if there is no additional complex of singular lines the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely Af
This contradicts the preceding observations and so under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that zg is a Af curve on a quadric surface
Continuing with the case in which zg is a Af curve on a quadric Q we first observe that the second regulus of Q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of zg and the planes through any one of the multiple secants
For each of these lines meets Q in three points namely two points on zg and one point on one of the multiple secants
Now consider an arbitrary line l meeting Q in two points Af and Af
If ya is the multiple secant of zg which passes through Af and yb is the simple secant of zg which passes through Af and if Af are the points in which ya meets zg and if Af is the image of Af on the generator yb it follows that the image of the line Af is Af
These societies can expect to face difficult times
As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces the gaps between rulers and subjects town and country will widen
new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence
old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction
National leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity
Feelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated -- in some of the new nations indeed they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past
Nevertheless with foresight and careful planning some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped
The United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible
Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face
At the same time we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts
It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home
We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene
When necessary we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development
As a nation we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development
but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community
When we look at countries like Iran Iraq Pakistan and Burma where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital and where institutions of centralized government exist we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy
The men in power are committed in principle to modernization but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically
Isolated enterprises have been launched but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern
The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communications between the two
Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources human and material can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted
Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective
In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals
The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can if it wishes provide all manner of services for them -- and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life
For example in accordance with the fashion of the times most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years
such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement
The civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them
and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice self-discipline and competence
American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies
We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm
Above all we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their fates
Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance
With respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions we can afford to wait for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see
Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments
We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities state and provincial governments rural communities and other smaller groups making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected
Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education how health affects labor productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community and above all how progress in each field relates to national progress
Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development
To achieve this goal of balanced development communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account
If modernization programs are imposed from above without the understanding and cooperation of the people they will encounter grave difficulties
Land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries
It should be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society
As an isolated policy land reform is likely to be politically disruptive
as part of a larger development effort however it may gain wide acceptance
It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy can not be solved by administrative decrees alone
Land reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture
Lastly governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead
By holding out prospects for external capital assistance the United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth
Actively modernizing societies
At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India Brazil the Philippines and Taiwan which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth
They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs
and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups
But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital
they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels
and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies
On the economic front the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources
Several related tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved
These countries must formulate a comprehensive long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy
They must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years
Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward
Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning
Finally a balance must be effected among project finance utilization of agricultural surpluses and general balance of payments support
Thus although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange
There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved
For one thing although considerable numbers of men have been trained bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects
even the famed Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken
Technical assistance in training middle- and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases
There are also more basic problems
This is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people
Nevertheless impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices
Another great danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism
The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West
Particularly when based upon a single dominant party governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest
Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort becoming instead more rigid and inflexible in their policies
American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes
It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies
We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries
we also have in consequence the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways
The time factor
We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time
With the exception of treaty-making foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration
Foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection
American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition
but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes political institutions and social structure which each society must generate
It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon
It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark
This condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy especially in the context of economic aid

Some of the major functions of religion
The place of religion in the simple preliterate societies is quite definite
as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it
In societies like ours however its place is less clear and more complex
With the diversity of religious viewpoints there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion
and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion
Nevertheless for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies though less for the less religious portion religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization they have important indirect consequences
If the inner functions of religion are performed the individual is a composed ordered motivated and emotionally secure associate
he is not greatly frustrated and he is not anomic
he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows
There are several closely related inner functions
In the last analysis religion is the means of inducing formulating expressing enhancing implementing and perpetuating man 's deepest experience -- the religious
Man is first religious
the instrumentalities follow
Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence
The significant things in it at the higher religious levels are the inner emotional mental and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation self-pacification and self-completion
The chief experience is the sensing of communion and in the higher religions of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power
Related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered dependable universe
Man has the experience of being helpfully allied with what he can not fully understand
he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement
The universe is a safe and permanent home
A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal
Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance
man has a second chance
He is not lost in the abyss of endless time
he has endless being
Religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit
Religion can summate epitomize relate and conserve all the highest ideals and values -- ethical aesthetic and religious -- of man formed in his culture
There is also the possibility among higher religions of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness
The kind of religious experience that most moderns seek not only provides clarifies and relates human yearnings values ideals and purposes
it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality sociality and creativeness
Under the religious impulse whether theistic or humanistic men have joy in living
life leads somewhere
Religion at its best is out in front ever beckoning and leading on and as Lippman put it `` mobilizing all man 's scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance ``
At the same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also has great therapeutic value for him
It gives him aid comfort even solace in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate
He is confronted with the recurrent crises such as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life -- marriage incurable disease widowhood old age the certainty of death
He has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie
His religious beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern and his religious faith makes possible fortitude equanimity and consolation enabling him to endure colossal misfortune fear frustration uncertainty suffering evil and danger
Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation mainly in a promised perfect future state
The belief in immortality where held functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here and now
The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession repentance and penance
The feeling of individual inferiority defeat or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly but all-victorious Father-God as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies
In providing for these inner individual functions religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution
In addition to the functions of religion within man there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society
The two have never been separable
Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation
The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with and to a degree dependent upon a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions
The religion supports re-enforces reaffirms and maintains the fundamental values
Even in the United States with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values
This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere
for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism
In America also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion
Even the non-church members -- the freewheelers marginal religionists and so on -- have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them
Furthermore religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values
for example those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends
Finally it gives sanctity more than human legitimacy and even through super-empirical reference transcendent and supernatural importance to some values
for example marriage as a sacrament much law-breaking as sinful occasionally the state as a divine instrument
It places certain values at least beyond questioning and tampering
Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends
This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends
for example a plan that fulfills the will of God which advances the Kingdom of God which involves social life as part of the Grand Design
This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy
It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action
Finally it gives meaning to much social endeavor and logic consistency and meaning to life
In general there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends
Religion integrates and unifies
Some of the oldest most persistent and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion
These groups have varied widely from mere families primitive totemic groups and small modern cults and sects to the memberships of great denominations and great widely dispersed world religions
Religion fosters group life in various ways
The common ultimate values ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor
Without a system of values there can be no society
Where such a value system prevails it always unifies all who possess it
it enables members of the society to operate as a system
The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in creeds dogmas and doctrines and form what Durkheim calls a credo
As he points out a religious group can not exist without a collective credo and the more extensive the credo the more unified and strong is the group
The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine
the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine the firmer the group
The religious symbolism and especially the closely related rites and worship forms constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith
The religion in fact is an expression of the unity of the group small or large
The common codes for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior bind the devotees together
These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized standardized and ordered religiously sanctified behavior
The codes are mechanism for training in and directing and enforcing uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group
Durkheim noted long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things unites into one single moral community all those who adhere to them ``
His view is that every religion pertains to a community and conversely every community is in one aspect a religious unit
This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United States
and it is evidenced in the prayers offered in the frequent religious allusions and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds
The unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units with religion as the dominant bond even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized
The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion are cases in point
It might be pointed out that the integrating function of religion for good or ill has often supported or been identified with other groupings -- political nationality language class racial sociability even economic
Religion usually exercises a stabilizing-conserving function
As such it acts as an anchor for the people
There is a marked tendency for religions once firmly established to resist change not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices but also in secular affairs having religious relevance
It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones
It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments the traditional ways of thinking and the customary ways of living
As Yinger has pointed out the `` reliance on symbols on tradition on sacred writings on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values turns one to the past far more than to the future ``
Historically religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction and perpetuation of various other institutions
At the same time that religion exercises a conserving influence it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups
Much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives
The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices
for example the Crusades mission efforts just wars
Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion
The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects
Religion provides the most attractive rewards either in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by its norms but who engage in good works
Religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control enforcing what men should or should not do
Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group
and in modern societies such influence is still great
Religion has its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now
Overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband 's marginal income her defense of denial was excessively strong
Thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem
The result dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family 's disrupted daily functioning was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin whose birth had not been anticipated
Soon Mrs B 's fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family
Inability to care for the other children difficulty in feeding the babies who seemed colicky bone-weary fatigue repeated crying episodes and short tempers reflected the family 's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation
Clearly this was a family in crisis
Mrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother 's death when she was eight as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying
Her previous traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday
On the anniversary of her father 's death she poured out with agonized tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral
In the family 's own words during the third of twelve visits they had `` reached the crisis peak -- either the situation will give or we will break ``
Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs B 's anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears of annihilation
Abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss abandonment and annihilation produced further relief of tension
In a joint interview Mr. and Mrs. B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger son 's wandering away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins
The father accurately perceiving the child 's needs not only respected them as worthy of his attention but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins saying `` I have a big lap
there is room for you too Johnnie ``
Simultaneously a variety of environmental supports -- a calm but not too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent use of nursing care accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms
Follow-up visits of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family 's day-to-day mental health and social functioning
As seen in the B. family there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance
The lack of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety often assuming the superficial guise of `` not knowing `` or `` not caring ``
The unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled transference
In general the approach is more active than passive more out-reaching than reflective
While some regression is inevitable it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy
To establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness immediately preferably within the first interview by meeting the client 's specific needs
These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension
The initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking sense
In this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client 's ability to deal with the problem
In so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact
Thus the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf
Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation
We are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of denial and crippling guilt turned against the self
While some suppression and some denial are not only necessary but healthy the worker 's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed
In steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive responses the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques of specific emotional support clarification and anticipatory guidance
Over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve weeks the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth between immediate external stressful exigencies `` precipitating stress `` and the key emotionally relevant issues `` underlying problem `` which are often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough reactivated by the crisis situation and hence once again amenable to resolution
Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques they do challenge the worker 's skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments
Then too the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits single and group office interviews and appropriate telephone follow-up calls if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention
In addition in many cases a variety of concrete social resources -- homemaker day care medical and financial aid -- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts
At certain critical stages and only for sound diagnostic reasons it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating
While expensive in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker in terms of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client 's life techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives
Finally whatever the techniques used a twin goal is common to all preventive casework service to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities
Having outlined an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we now address ourselves to our final question What place should brief crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services
We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum each important in its own right
This problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself
Almost three decades ago Bertha Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services
Her conclusion has been borne out in the experience of many practitioners `` short-contact interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work ``
Thus casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended
That we are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature
Especially noteworthy is Levinger 's finding that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of successful outcome
According to a number of studies the important predictors are the nature and management of the client 's anxiety as well as the accessibility of the helping person
For example the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project
Of startling significance too is the assertion that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated child guidance services
These reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people
Similarities to the approach which I have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship quick appraisal of key issues and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the ego 's coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses
While there are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client 's initial need for help
In some programs treatment is concentrated over a short period of time while in others after the initial contact is established flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success
Willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening the worker can withdraw is another prominent feature in these efforts
My aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy `` but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess and to use them with greater confidence precision and professional pride
Though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary -- or perhaps in some instances primary -- level the place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number of investigators in a wide variety of settings
Woodward for example has emphasized the `` need for a broad spectrum of services including very brief services in connection with critical situations ``
Ideally brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance
Moreover the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available -- and on a more effective basis to more people
Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures crisis problems reaction mechanisms and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration with community planners
Our literature is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian
Probably in the immediate future we will have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models
Increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare services holds rich promise for the future
For example child welfare experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships
Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling
One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating
The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study
The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating
It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society
The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation
The newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship
As Loomis remarks `` In the internal pattern the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking friendship and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic relations ``
Maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today
Yet the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war
Prior to World War 2 there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after World War 2
The norms as elements refer to `` all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system ``
The process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements
The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population
From the evidence `` it may be conjectured that core core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and females
core marginal marriages still belong in the category of permissive unions
and core Negro marriages are proscribed for core members ``
The element of status-roles and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of conjectures about them
There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power has been exerted on actors in the system particularly in regard to mate selection
This would seem to vary from family to family depending somewhat on the core or marginal `` status `` of that family
Again size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls
Interviews with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the ranking of the various families in the population
The large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the upper positions
Loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation process
`` The standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system ``
Despite the increasing rate of exogamous marriages the population has been able to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of its intermediate status in society
To some extent the system can be considered a Gemeinschaft in which `` social-role occupancies are determined by birth by attributes such as sex or caste which are biologically or socially immutable ``
The adherence of many in the population to the Indian background in their pedigree and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestors had never been slaves becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate status of the group in society
The negative sanctions applied to core Negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected adherence to group norms
However because of Church laws lately more stringently enforced which forbid the marriage of cousins closely related consanguineously a means of facilitating the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate unions
A cursory survey of available material indicates a high rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship
The comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems
Within the larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems
The structural subsystem consisting of relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts includes 1
Subgroups of various types interconnected by relational norms
Roles of various types within the larger system and within the subgroups 3
Regulative norms governing subgroups and roles
Cultural values
In the study of marriage patterns for this group consanguinity produces the structural system -- a system of affinities -- which in turn maintains the system of consanguinity
Subgroups of various types have been found within this system
Each family line can be considered a substructure
There seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group
Additionally the proscription of core Negro marriages for core families discussed above would seem to act as a regulative norm governing subgroups and roles
The scope of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the subgroups
However it can not be presumed informal though the structure of the population seems that there are not well-defined roles within the system
The present study relates to the theory of functional systems
It is hypothesized that fertility is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division of core families and marginal families is considered
The four functional problems of a social system are to some extent solved by the subsystems within this population
By means of geographical isolation and high fertility rates inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained
In order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection and the clustering of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls
To maintain their intermediate position in the larger society it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible `` but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate distinct grouping or system in society
As mentioned above where families are concentrated in larger numbers group controls seem strongest and most effective
Adaptation to the social and non-social environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational segregation
This provides the necessary contact with the larger society while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts
Integration `` has to do with the inter-relation of parts ``
The problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values
The values placed by the Brandywine population upon maintaining a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial identity and therefore a certain separate social status are important for the morale of the system
Since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration the higher the morale and solidarity the better the system can solve the problems of the system
In this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within the same general locality the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population
It is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation
In turn higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity
The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger
Of particular utility in the analysis of the development persistence and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes
Loomis considers six such processes in his paradigm
Institutionalization Though undoubtedly all six processes are operative within the whole social system and its subsystems two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be singled out for particular emphasis
In discussing the process of communication Loomis defines it as `` the process by which information decisions and directives are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge opinions and attitudes are formed or modified by interaction ``
Communication may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger community
Intense interaction is easier where segregated living and occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community as in the case of this population
However the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation
Although the Brandywine population is still predominantly rural `` there are indications of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities
Urbanization appears to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group
This conclusion is however an over-simplification
A more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the urban-fringe area are in general less segregated locally than group members in rural areas
In the urban area in other words they unlike some urban ethnic groups do not concentrate in ghetto colonies
Group pressures toward conformity are slight or non-existent and deviant behavior in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions
In such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily in mate selection behavior
To the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential isolation to that extent it contributes directly to increased exogamy ``
Social control
The process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play a part in the individual 's behavior as well as the group 's behavior
By means of this social control deviance is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group
Examples from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned by ostracism from the group
There is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society
Confused and divided though this tradition may be it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and acts as a means of socialization particularly for members of the rural community
The fact of Indian ancestry and `` free `` status during the days of slavery are important distinctions made by members of the group
Boundary maintenance
`` Culturally induced social cohesion resulting from common norms and values internalized by members of the group `` is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of socialization
The process of boundary maintenance identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems and the characteristic interaction is maintained
As the threat of encroachment on the system increases the `` probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases ``
The fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintaining the boundary
`` Increased boundary maintenance may be achieved for example by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern
'' The external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that enables the group to survive in its environment
'' Boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social as is the preference for endogamy
It is also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural areas
By their pattern of endogamy and exogamy the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain
Systemic linkage
Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group systemic linkage is defined `` as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit
A royal decree issued in 1910 two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms
Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919
In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered
But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors
A unified set of regulations applicable to all areas was issued in 1929 and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time
The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933
General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre AIMO Af Direction Af Direction Generale Gouvernement Generale
Tribal authorities the chiefs and their secretaries were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories under the general supervision of district officials
The district officials along with their other duties were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics
The regulations require the inscription of each individual male or female adult or child on a separate card fiche
The cards filed by circonscription sub-chiefdom or village are kept in the headquarters of each territoire chiefdom
Each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned including his or her date of birth or age at a specified time spouses and children
Additional entries must be made from time to time
Different cards are used for males and females and a corner is clipped from the cards of adults and of children when they reach puberty
So a quick count could be made at any time even by an illiterate clerk of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes
Personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments inoculations periods of employment and changes of residence are recorded
Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females
Each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand
The registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons
The cards of permanent out-migrants are in theory sent to an office in the place of new residence
Finally the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions
Numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes were counted each year
In addition demographic inquiries supposedly involving field investigations were conducted in selected minor divisions circonscriptions containing about 3 percent of the total population
The results of these inquiries were used to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts including birth and death rates general fertility rates distributions by marital status fertility of wives separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households infant mortality and migration
The areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials supposedly as representative of a larger population
Averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population
The scheme in theory is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions of African life
But it places a severe strain on the administrative resources already burdened in other ways of a widely dispersed poor and largely illiterate population
The sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies
The system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers
The distinction between domiciled de jure and present de facto population was not clearly defined
So the results are subject to considerable confusion
The system tended to break down during the war but was reactivated
it had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951
In spite of the defects in this system the figures on total population during the late 1930 's and again in the early 1950 's seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity
But the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading
The same system with minor modifications was developed in Ruanda-Urundi under Belgian administration
Here again it seems that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods
Before considering more recent activities we should note another important aspect of demography in Belgian Africa
A number of strong independent agencies established in some cases with governmental or royal support have conducted large medical social educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi
The work of Fonds Reine Elisabeth pour l'Assistance Medicale aux Indigenes Du Congo Belge FOREAMI has special interest with respect to demography
This agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from 638,560 persons in 1941 to 840,503 in 1956 in the Kwango District and adjacent areas east of Leopoldville
Each year from 1941 on its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and as its primary objective the incidence of major diseases
Its findings are reported each year in its Rapport Sur l'activite Pendant annee Bruxelles
Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas
Other independent or partially independent agencies have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography
These studies vary widely in scope and precision
L'Institut pour La Recherche Scientifique En Afrique Centrale IRSAC has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has cooperated closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development of its official statistics
A massive investigation of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J. J. Maquet former Director of the Social Science branch of IRSAC now a professor at l'Universite Officielle Du Congo Belge et Du Ruanda-Urundi
Some 30,000 completed schedules with 20 items collected by sub-chiefs in 1,100 circumscriptions have been tabulated
The results are now being analyzed
Statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs
The AIMO organizations of both countries which maintain administrative services throughout the territories retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information
However the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics
A Bureau De La Demographie A. Romaniuk Director was formed under AIMO in the Congo to work in close rapport with the Section Statistique of the Secretariat General
Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office
The 1952 demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V. Neesen a member of the IRSAC staff though the inquiry was carried out under the auspices of AIMO which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory
A member of the IRSAC staff E. Van De Walle was recently delegated to cooperate with AIMO in the development of demographic statistics in this territory
The initiation of sampling censuses in Ruanda-Urundi 1952 and in the Congo 1955 57 were major advances
We will deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into operation later than the other
The radical nature of the innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official announcements
The term enquetes demographiques previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative censuses was used for the new investigations
However the differences in procedure are fundamental
These are as follows 1 field work procedures
Field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time African investigators three teams each working in two provinces
These teams carried out the same operations successively in different areas
2 nature of the sample
Sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits
In short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling
The populations of the various districts or other major divisions were stratified by type of community rural urban mixed and where appropriate by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy
Sample units villages in rural areas houses in cities were drawn systematically within these strata
3 size of the sample
Different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions
Higher proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas
About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries
4 questions and definitions
Uniform questions definitions and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country
Data were obtained separately on three classes of persons A residents present
B residents absent
and C visitors
In the reports summary results are given for both the de facto A and C and de jure A and B populations
but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de jure population or in some districts only the de facto population
These changes represent in effect a shift from 1 an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to 2 a systematic sampling census of the whole African population
The population registration system still has important functions
It supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations
It provides a frame for the sampling census
It also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force though one can not expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this source in the near future
It is still used in making current population estimates in post-census years though the value of these estimates is open to question
Finally it may have certain very important less obvious values
Even though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there they contain precise information on ages by date of birth for some of the persons present especially children in relatively stable communities and supplementary information such as records of marital status for many others
The quality of the census data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries
Furthermore it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method as distinguished from sampling error in each of these sources on such subjects as fertility mortality and migration during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction
The first sampling census in the Congo extended over a three-year period 1955 57
the results were still being processed in 1959
It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more expeditiously
It is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses be carried out at five-year intervals
Reports already issued on the sampling census 1955 57 in various areas run as follows using only the French and omitting corresponding Flemish titles
This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables
Other reports in identical form but with somewhat varying content have been issued
These area reports will be followed according to present plans by a summary report which will include a detailed statement on methods
With this evidence in mind the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes
Toward the end of the semester 's work he interviewed every married class member at great length
He found as he had suspected a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students
However all admitted that the `` hindsight `` was not altogether lost
In their own words it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time
In fact they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be at the beginning some `` hindsight `` study
but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent
All of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course
A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students
As one of them expressed it `` It has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these not-yet-married people
I can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past
Had I been in an all-married section I would have missed this and I believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me ``
This comment and others similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status quo
But the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction
Thus the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married -- that is prerequisite `` marriage ``
This did not mean that married students could not enroll in other `` mixed `` sections and some of them largely because of scheduling difficulties did
But only those already married could enroll in this one section
In addition two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted
1 The regular sections do not allow freshmen
this one did
This action was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores
Many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another
By permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it
This has subsequently been verified by the experience
2 Auditors were encouraged
In the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged
The philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively
Besides auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students
But in this one section we welcomed auditors
Why
For no particular reason other than that the writer felt it might -- just might -- encourage both mates to be in attendance
Many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially in the various engineering fields with few electives till the senior year
Incidentally it needs to be noted that because auditors were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week until at last it swelled to such proportions that this `` free `` auditing policy had to be retracted
After that we began to get `` visitors `` to class
This experimental class represented quite a variety of students
It ranged from a freshman woman just married through the various academic growth stages including one senior-graduate student to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended
It ranged from those with no children through students in various stages of pregnancy to one 44-year-old male with four children three of whom were teenagers
It ranged from two women members who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive
One might digress at this point and speculate that if it is `` wise `` to create special sections for special status then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children and so on
Some of these speculations may have some merit others are somewhat ambiguous
But few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation
The writer began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place
He made it clear from the beginning that this was the students opportunity and that the future destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one
He did build a framework of academic `` respectability `` and one which did not encroach upon the `` sacred sovereignty `` of any other existing campus course
This is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods nor a course in how to raise children
We already have courses covering those problems and so on
But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible
A steering committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate the direction and pace the class was taking
The writer being cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students did insist on there being included some `` hindsight `` material
But the greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes `` So we are married -- now how do we make the best of it ``
Or `` How do we enrich our already fine marriage ``
Films were used as with all sections but with one big difference
Our campus unfortunately owns no films
Since they are all either rented or borrowed the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance
The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be
For example the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched
Since the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision -- after of course pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one
Thus the films seen as they came in coordinated for the regular sections were often out of context
Nevertheless the writer has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion after film showings
Though it did not become known to the writer for some time a nucleus group had sprung up within the class
They began to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class
From a few students this group gradually increased to include over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class and many outsiders as well
Also although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning most reported that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of that class
In fact they often revamped their social activities to include class members previously unknown
Supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections the major difference being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group
These students although they might read various articles in popular magazines more often chose to report on articles found in the journals
In addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read
Whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest
Since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment nor as a matter of fact in those who were continuing in `` single sections `` he can only conclude that there must have been something `` contagious `` within the specific group which caused this to occur
In the main this course took the following directional high roads
1 A great deal of time was spent on processes for solving marital differences
This was not a search for a `` magic formula `` but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage
In short it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy
Not until the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to 2 Specific adjustment areas such as sex in-laws religion finance and so on
From here they proceeded to 3 These same areas in relation to their own future family life stages developing these to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to confront them at some time or other
As an example of this last facet there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement
Mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward but the possible death of one 's own spouse was not overlooked
Since the course one member has lost her husband
This was not a particularly shocking or unexpected thing -- it was previously known to her that it might happen
But just when was an unknown and of course the longer it did not happen the stronger her wish and belief that it might not
Since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis
Quite frequently class members brought questions from their mates at home
These were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them
This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation
Both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely enlightening
The writer sensed a much freer and more frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before
He felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that orgasm as a criterion is not nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think
This was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again
On the other hand the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with love as most women seem to do
In the reproductive area it could be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students had previously in `` mixed `` marital status sections
Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent
Never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various stages of pregnancy
There was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented from a childless couple to and including every trimester
In fact we had one birth before the end of the course and another student had to take the final examiantion a week early just to be on the safe side
There was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester
Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring `` experience
It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like `` as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances
This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action
Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it `` and `` two pieces of rope `` were quite characteristic
Guilford-Martin personality inventories
The three personality inventories Guilford
Guilford-Martin
Guilford-Martin were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects
These were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test
Some predictions had been made concerning factors R N I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity
Only Co differentiated between the two groups at less than the 5 level Af
One prediction had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not
The nonreactors had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure `` nonreactors and `` secure `` reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies
It was predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the `` Inferiority `` factor
All of the subjects in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups as defined for purposes of the personality studies were compared with those subjects who shifted in Conditions 3 or 4
A t test on these two groups shifters vs. nonshifters gave a `` t `` value of 2.405 which is significant on the two-tail test at the
Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study
Only 27 11 subjects gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon
There were 49 20 subjects who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration
There were 24 10 subjects who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured as to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction
Among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred
One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax
Five subjects 12 did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm what that something was and also were given a demonstration
Four subjects 10 did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed while others did not
At no time was it implied by the experimenter that the subject 's initial reaction was deviant
The subjects were only given information about other possibilities of `` normal `` reaction
Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion
This information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing it
These subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried
The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in Condition 1 the naive state is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal cues
In no way either verbally or behaviorally did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary contraction
Moreover when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation
They continued to give an arm-elevation
A differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion
Autosuggestibility the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own expectations of the outcome i.e that the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction `` also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons 1 the subjects apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose and 2 manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happening e.g of becoming dizzy and maybe falling an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the subjects
A suggestion Hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal `` reactions different from those which they gave
While they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had they were also informed that there were other normals who reacted as they had
There was no implication made that their initial reaction absence of an arm-elevation was less preferred than the presence of levitation
A more tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as `` normal ``
The naive state Condition 1 could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting one for 24 of the subjects in this study
They were not free to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior
Instructions to relax i.e to be `` spontaneous `` and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given
While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior
Alcohol ingestion succeeded in changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject the only one with whom this technique was tried
This subject who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions used in this experiment while sober
After two drinks containing alcohol her arm flew upward very freely
There was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement
She described herself as having the same kind of `` irresponsible `` feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis
She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls
Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it
These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had
The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control
They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors
They felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction
Some of those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors -- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily
One subject spontaneously asked after her arm had finally risen `` Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before ``
Another said that her arm did not go up at first `` because I would n't let it
I thought it was n't supposed to ``
This subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first
She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial but had consciously prevented it from so doing
She explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax ``
When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up she commented `` I do n't see how they can prevent it ``
In contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity
They felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level
The above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in abeyance in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects
but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation
One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows `` You feel they 're going up and you 're on a stage and it 's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that 's what 's supposed to happen ``
She then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she relinquished control
However she was able to relax and yield to the moment
It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects
that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors
It is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below
Thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality factor
The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world
There was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline
This occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill
They knew that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the aniseikonic lenses
Yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be
The change in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations
They were able to experience at first in terms of past conventionality
When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions they were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present
It might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong
that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as `` threatening `` until they are tested and proved otherwise
While the interpretations that have been given are inferences only they gain support from such comments as the following which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not on the first trial perceive the tilt illusion
Control of socioeconomic status
It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated the degree of structure in teaching method
The structured schools were in an industrial city with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes
The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community predominantly middle- to upper-middle class but fringed by an industrial area
In order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods
School principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas
An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data
Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods
Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement
Therefore third-grade children were chosen as subjects for this study
For purposes of sample selection only individual tests were given later we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade population in each school system
The subjects for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution one-third as underachievers one-third medium and one-third over-achievers
Children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total third-grade school population were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection
Over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system
The final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores
Twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured schools furnished 156 cases 87 boys and 69 girls
Eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished 72 cases 36 boys and 36 girls
Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools
It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation
Rating scale of compulsivity
An interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home
The parent was asked to describe the child 's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others irrational conformity to rules orderliness punctuality and need for certainty
The interviewers were instructed not to suggest answers and as much as possible to record the parents actual words as they described the child 's behavior in home situations
The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records
Final ratings were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms
Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals
The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters
For instance the following statement was rated low in compulsivity `` She 's naturally quite neat about things but it does n't bother her at all if her room gets messy
But she cleans it up very well when I remind her ``
Measurement of anxiety
Castaneda et al revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for use with children
The Taylor Scale was adapted from the Minnesota Multiphastic Personality Inventory with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety
There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees
Reliability and validation work with the Children 's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale
Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group testing device in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items
Relationship of Anxiety to compulsivity
The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity
The two ratings yield a correlation of which is not significantly different from zero
therefore we have measured two different characteristics
In theory compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer
The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later
In the primary grades reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years
In establishing criterion measurements it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself
The predicted interaction effect should if potent extend its influence over all academic achievement
The Stanford Achievement Test Form J was administered by classroom teachers consisting of a battery of six sub-tests Paragraph Meaning Word Meaning Spelling Language Arithmetic Computation and Arithmetic Reasoning
All of these sub-tests involve reading except Arithmetic Computation
Scores are stated in grade-equivalents on a national norm
The battery median grade-equivalent was used in data analysis in this study
The Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children was administered to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker
The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact in this case Af
therefore in the investigation of the present hypothesis it was necessary to control this factor
The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement
It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I.Q
For example on the basis of the regression equation a child with an I.Q of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 grade equivalent
If a child with an I.Q of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement his discrepancy score would be representing of one year of over-achievement
A child with an I.Q of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 3.5
If such a child scored 3.0 his discrepancy score would be -.5 representing of one year of under-achievement
In this manner the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables
test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods
Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable
Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of each sub-group graphically
First of all as we had surmised the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better Af on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools
It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools the high compulsive children do better Af
No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school
The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported in this case at the level
While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives
Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant
We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting but that their need to organize for comfort is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment
It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores although not significantly lower
Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure
Our conjecture is then that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work
When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then does such a child attain unusual success
Test of interaction of anxiety and teaching methods
The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4
Figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group
As predicted the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly Af than those in the structured schools
The interaction effect which is significant at the level can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores
While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well Af in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom
The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools
According to the theory proposed this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment
The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit
The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem
Failure confirms the threat and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced
The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination
But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple
As shown earlier the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements
Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved
By the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words
Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked
Sarason et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like situation and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher
Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations the results do not confirm their conclusion
Observers in the two school systems studied here judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting
Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting
Analysis means the evaluation of subparts the comparative ratings of parts the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts
Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose to evaluate procedures regardless of individuals
For example a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying
Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis
One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas
The president of a small firm selling restaurant products had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business
Interviewing checking references training the salesmen having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high
It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed
Roleplaying was offered as a solution -- and the procedure worked as follows all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room where the president explained the difficulty he had and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out
In place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires checking their references interviewing them asking them to be tried out he told them he would prefer to test them
Each person was to enter the testing room carrying a suitcase of samples
Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product
In the testing room he was to make successively three presentations to three different people
In the testing room three of the veteran salesmen served as antagonists
One handled the salesman in a friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a hesitating manner
Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it
The antagonists came in one at a time and did not see or hear the other presentations
After each presentation the antagonist wrote his judgment of the salesmen
and so did the observers consisting of the president three of his salesmen and a psychologist
Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon
This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months
The batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three
The president of the firm calculating expenses alone felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent
The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work `` in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different but typical restaurant owners and managers
They were in a sense `` tried out `` in realistic situations
From the point of view of the applicants less time was wasted in being evaluated -- and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances
Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work
The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions
All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist
At the end of work one day the personnel man took the applicants one at a time asked them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes
Each girl was independently `` tested `` by the personnel man and he served not only as the director but as the antagonist and the observer
Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist showing wit sparkle and aplomb
She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day
In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning
Some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure
An engineer had been made the works manager of a firm supplanting a retired employee who had been considered outstandingly successful
The engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm was well trained was considered a hard worker was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` comer ``
However he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position
He seemed to antagonize everyone
Turnover rates of personnel went up production dropped and morale was visibly reduced
Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer he seemed to be a very poor administrator although no one quite knew what was wrong with him
At the insistence of his own supervisor -- the president of the firm -- he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders
He played a number of typical situations before observers other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong
Entirely concerned with efficiency he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes condemning them to too great an extent
He did not really listen to others had little interest in their ideas and wanted to have his own way -- which was the only right way
The entire group of managers explained in great detail a number of human relations errors that he made
One by one these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors
He admitted his behavior and defended it
He refused to change his approach and instead he attacked high and low -- the officials for their not backing him and subordinates for their laxness stupidity and stubbornness
After the diagnosing he left the course convinced that it could do him no good
We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment
The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it
We may say that his attitude was foolish since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills
or we may say that his attitude was commendable showing his independence of mind in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others
In any case he refused to accept the implications of the analysis that he needed to be made over
Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis
In a course for supermarket operators a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time
On playing some typical situations before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory
He was told he displayed for example a sense of superiority -- and he answered `` Well I am supposed to know all the answers are n't I ``
He was criticized for his curtness and abruptness -- and he answered `` I am not working to become popular ``
On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered `` I have to make decisions
That 's my job ``
In short as frequently happens in analyses the individual feels threatened and defends himself
However in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways
The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms
How this was accomplished may be described since this sometimes is a crucial problem
The director helped tailor-make a check list of the district manager 's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences commenting on the mistakes they felt he made
These errors were then collected and written on a blackboard condensing similar ideas
Eighteen errors were located and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors
They were asked to vote `` true `` if they thought they had seen him make the error `` false `` if they thought he had not
and `` can not say `` if they were not certain
The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard
No comments were made during the voting
The results looked as follows Af
The first eight of these eighteen statements which received at least one-half of the votes were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations the members checked any items that appeared
To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions they were rather lengthy about twenty minutes the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect new antagonists were brought on the scene unexpectedly and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticized
After every session the check marks were totaled up and graphed and in this way the supervisor 's progress was charted
In life we learn to play our roles and we `` freeze `` into patterns which become so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do
We can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves and others can see us better than we see ourselves
To learn what we do is the first step for improvement
To accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step
To want to change is the third step
To practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step
To use these new ways in daily life is the last step
Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training
When an evaluative situation is set up and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation
Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion
This behavior is more `` veridical `` -- or true -- than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning
While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time it represents one of the major uses of this procedure
Chapter 10 spontaneity training
the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts
In addition the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed
The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area
The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold
Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new
It is not easy for the therapist to discern when in the patient 's communicating an introject has appeared and is holding sway
One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one a quality which sounds somehow artificial or in some instances parrot-like
The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove
only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom common to our culture which he has evidently heard over and over from a parent until he experiences it as part of him
One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion during which despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks I felt only a cold annoyance with her
Eventually such incidents became more sporadic and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior and in one particular session after several minutes of such behavior -- which as usual went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked eagerly `` Did you see Granny ``
At first I did not know what she meant
I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother in their distant home-city
Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me this time what Granny was like
and when I replied in this spirit she corroborated my hunch
At another phase in the therapy when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene she muttered in a low but intense voice to herself `` I hate that woman inside me ``
I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this
but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone `` Your father despises you ``
Again I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak with such utter conviction of an opinion held by my father now several years deceased
Then I replied coldly `` If you despise me why do n't you say so directly ``
She looked confused at this and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make
It then occurred to me to ask `` Is that what that woman told you ``
She clearly agreed that this had been the case
I realized now that she had been showing me in what impressed me as being a very accurate way something her mother had once said to her
it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her
What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like
Earlier this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times when she was in her room alone it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice
A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine who used to often seclude herself in her room often sounded through the closed door -- as I would find on passing by between our sessions -- for all the world like two persons a scolding mother and a defensive child
Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware and the recognition of which as a part of himself he finds distinctly unwelcome
I have found time and again that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests in the final analysis on this basis
and only when I can acknowledge this to myself as being indeed an aspect of my personality does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior
For example one hebephrenic man used to annoy me month after month by saying whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day or whenever `` You 're welcome `` in a notably condescending fashion -- as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful `` thank you `` to him at the end of each session
Eventually it became clear to me partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly that this man with his condescending `` You 're welcome `` was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor over these months on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note each time that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow
Another patient a paranoid woman for many months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met
This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between on the one hand her arranging the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others and on the other hand my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections bringing my big easy chair with me usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state and plunking myself down in my chair -- in short behaving as if I owned her room
Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated or reduced in their communicative expression to some comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement
One finds for example that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings and the most unconventional of meanings
More than anything it is the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed something like a spread-out deck of cards on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient 's and his months of work together
One can not assume of course that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy or at any one time later on when the stereotype was uttered
probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a well-grooved stereotyped mode of expression -- and no or but a few other communicational grooves as yet -- being there available for the patient 's use as newly-emerging emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months
But it is true that the therapist can sense when he hears this stereotype that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another
Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype -- a `` How are you now ``
Or an `` I want to go home `` or whatever -- but a nonverbal one which reveals itself gradually as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning
A hebephrenic man used to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his largely-silent hours with his therapist
When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him `` What is that Bill -- hello or farewell ``
the patient replied `` Both Dearie -- two in one ``
Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression that which seems best to give release and communicational expression to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter
It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients shows as one of his characteristic symptoms laughter -- laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated which now makes one feel like weeping or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair
and which more often than all these conveys a welter of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another
To a much less full extent the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function
in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch or the passage of flatus not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute forms of communication in which from time to time quite different things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them in words
As I have been intimating in the schizophrenic -- and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic
this is a question which I have no wish to take up -- condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are at an unconscious level well sorted out but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which even in the unconscious have yet to become well differentiated from one another
Freeman Cameron and McGhie in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients say in regard to condensation that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation ``
In my experience a great many of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience
Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing or incident in his immediate environment by some symbolic-sounding hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene
Recently for example a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing in the session about the intrusive curiosity which has become in her opinion a deplorable characteristic of mid-twentieth-century human culture developed itself before the end of the session into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast as indeed I was
Or equally often a concretistic-seeming particularistic-seeming statement may consist with its mundane exterior in a form of poetry -- may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression a metaphor a smile an allegory or some other symbolic mode of speaking
Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is more often than not entirely unaware
His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one
One hebephrenic women confided to me `` I live in a world of words `` as if to her words were fully concrete objects
Burnham in his excellent article 1955 concerning schizophrenic communication includes mention of similar clinical material
A borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding in a most articulate fashion during session after session with me were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him
as he spoke I was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung high in the air from a docked steamship
The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes stems suffixes etc
A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian
For English the reduction in size is less striking
This approach requires that 1 each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries and 2 the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word
The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file
Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis
We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem
But first we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space
occurrence -- an instance of a form in text
We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text
We accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer
A random-storage scheme based on the spelling of forms provides an economical way to compile this text-form list
Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked
A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form
dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text
Finally information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process -- the grammatical description for sentence-structure determination equivalent-choice information for semantic analysis and target-language equivalents for output construction
The dictionary is a form dictionary at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries
Also the dictionary is divided into at least two parts the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms
A more detailed description of dictionary operations -- text lookup and dictionary modification -- gives a clearer picture
Text lookup as we will describe it consists of three steps
The first is compiling a list of text forms assigning an information cell to each and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence
For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions cells in the W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list
cells in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information cells for text forms
When an occurrence Af is isolated during text reading a random memory address Af the address of a cell in the X-region is computed from the form of Af
Let Af denote the form of Af
If cell Af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list it is now assigned as the information cell of Af
The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region beginning in cell Af
The address Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af
the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence
Text reading continues with the next occurrence
Let us assume that Af is identical to the form of an occurrence Af which preceded Af in the text
When this situation exists the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af
If Af was assigned as the information cell for Af the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af
The address Af is stored in the cell Af
When as in this case the two forms match the address Af is saved to represent the occurrence Af
Text reading continues with the next occurrence
A third situation is possible
The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form
Thus when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms one cell in the chain for each form
If Af leads to an address Af that is equal to the address computed from Af even though Af does not match Af the chain of information cells is extended from Af by storing the address of the next available cell in the Y-region Af in Af
The cell Af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of Af
A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af
similarly as many cells are added as are required
Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored
Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain
the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain
Hence when the address Af is computed from Af the cell Af and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether Af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain
When the information cell for Af has been determined it is saved as a representation of Af
Text reading continues with the next occurrence
Text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list
This initiates the second step of glossary lookup -- connecting the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms
Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list
Each time a dictionary form matches a text form the information cell of the matching text form is saved
The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved
These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage
If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read
The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time
Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading
A random address Af that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form
If cell Af is an information cell it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to Af each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored
The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms
When a match is found an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage
If cell Af is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list
These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation
The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text
The list of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and Y-regions are no longer required
Only the assignment of the information cells is important
The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text
The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis
A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence
The grammatical descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file
The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe
When entries are being retrieved from this file the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer
This selection-rejection process takes place as the file is read
Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj
The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form
The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage
When the complete file has been read the grammatical descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region
the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents
Hence the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence
The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms
This leaves the ordering of entries variable
Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it
Two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form
The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage
The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents
Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once
An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form
Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context
Thus one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form
If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible
For example the inflected forms of a word can be represented insofar as regular inflection allows by a stem and a set of endings to be attached
Indeed the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings
The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list
Similarly if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form
The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it
When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing information is written in complete detail
Entries are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased
In sentences patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here
The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end
There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes
Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley 's hymns are as follows
`` A charge to keep I have A God to glorify ``
In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung `` Boylston `` the syllables have and fy ending their lines have twice the time any other syllables have
Dominant stress is of course more than extended duration and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last
But the parallel is significant
When the answer to what 's wrong now
Is Bill 's broken a chair dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair
From the point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking
but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence
In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing
in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator know
In small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly
in the double sentence the smaller the town the friendlier the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people
In what 's a linguist
dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist
in who 's a linguist it will generally be on the complement a linguist
Dominant stress is on her luggage both in that 's her luggage where her luggage is the complement and in there 's her luggage where it is the subject
Adverbial second complements however are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences
If the answer to what was that noise
Is George put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement the cat not the second complement out
Final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress
If the answer to what was that noise
Is George reads the news emotionally dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally
When prepositional complements are divided as in what are you looking for
They are likely to lose dominant stress
Context is of extreme importance
What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not
Thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snows
The personal pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context
In I 'll go with George dominant stress is probably on George
but if George has just been mentioned prominently and the trip to be made has been under discussion what is said is probably I 'll go with him and dominant stress is probably on the preposition with
When a gesture accompanies who 's he
the personal pronoun has dominant stress because `` he `` has not been mentioned previously
If both George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context but the idea of telling George is new then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George
But when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious there is normally only light stress or no stress at all
Thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows nothing can snow snow but `` it ``
In there are n't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious
If women replaced people it would normally have dominant stress
In I have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do
If work is substituted for things with more exact contribution to meaning it will have dominant stress
In I know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing
In I knew you when you were a child and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty
Dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here
In the written language then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here but much of the time the written language simply depends on the reader 's alertness and a careless reader will have to back up and reread
Often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion
Thus in it 's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible and eat will have strong stress also
In she has it in for George dominant stress will ordinarily be on in where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to center
In we 're painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting
Where there is comparison or contrast dominant stresses normally operate to center attention
Thus in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for his and sisters but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters
In he 's hurting himself more than he 's hurting you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast
In is she Chinese or Japanese
The desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns of stress of Chinese and Japanese
Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship
Thus in Mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary 's concerned with an account of her trip about which she may later have made speeches for example and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts
In hunger stimulates man too the situation is very similar
Strong stress on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger
Here again in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context
When a word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction
Thus when yes I have is the response to have you finished reading the paper
The stress on have which here represents have finished reading the paper is quite strong
In Mack 's the leader at camp but Jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader and therefore has stress
Mack 's the leader at camp but Jack 's here with this is deprived of stress makes here the complement in the clause
In of all the suggestions that were made his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion and is stressed
When go represents itself and a complement being equivalent say to go to Martinique in which boat did Jack go on
It has strong stress
when it represents only itself and on which is its complement so that go on is semantically equivalent to board on has stronger stress than go does
Omission of a subordinator pronoun however does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object
Thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to
But when to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that I came to and similarly in that was the moment I came to there is much stronger stress on to
In I wanted to tell him but I was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him
In to tell him of course to is normally unstressed
When I have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions that I am to leave this place dominant stress is ordinarily on leave
When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions
It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written
Other examples follow
`` I 'll come by Tuesday
I ca n't be happy long without drinking water ``
In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on Tuesday there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language
but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most
In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking
but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water
But the use of stress in comparison and contrast for example can undermine distinctions such as these
And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by any means
In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them and in I looked up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second
-- Syllables are linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but as has been noted are consonantal under certain circumstances and which may or may not be combined with preceding and/or following consonants or combinations of consonants
Syllables are genuine units but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties
Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear
Doubt on this point is strongest before /l/ and AAb/ or /r/
From the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables
Historically re is the formative that is employed also in republic and al is the common suffix
When ity is added real clearly has two syllables
But there is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable and because of the fact that /l/ commonly has the quality of AAb/ when it follows vowel sounds deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with deal
It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels
No single explanation is adequate to account for this
Improvement however is urgent and at least three things will be needed
The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses
Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems both in their general outlines and in many specific details
An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems including some of the more unusual types
By contrast even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages
This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone
Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist
Papers like these four if widely read will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work
The second need is better field techniques
The great majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping types those who are convinced that tone can not be analysed those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter
The result has been neglect fumbling efforts or superficial treatment
As these maladies overlap so must the cure
Analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple
They will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures
Good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better work but also help them overcome negative attitudes
Actually none of these papers says much directly about field techniques
But it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics
These things have been disseminated by other means but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results
The third need is for better theory
We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels but it has not been
This can only be for one of two reasons either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory and hence techniques or our existing theories are insufficiently general
If as I suspect the problem is largely of the second sort then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems
One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems
Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis
Actual practice does not often work out this way
Tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal systems
Welmers has suggested one explanation
Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use
This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable
The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features
Of course something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component
But in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude
With tone individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them
Pitch differences from one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far exceed the small differences between tones
However any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone or in developing a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded
A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands paper
Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed
Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other
Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way
for example duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation
Some phonetic features for example glottal catch or murmur are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual systems
But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages
This explanation of tone difficulties however does not apply in all languages
In some the Ewe type mentioned above interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation spans
In many of the syllables intonation can be safely ignored and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation
Still even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect
A third explanation is suggested by Richardson 's analysis of Sukuma tone
There we see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system
While the phonemes can be very easily stated no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to morphemic units i.e until the morphophonemics is worked out or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success
In the `` typical tone language `` tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics
The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic systems however are very different
The inventory of tones is much smaller and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension pitch level
Consonantal systems are not merely larger they are multidimensional
Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system
The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous and only a small portion of them are actually used
Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system
Tonal morphophonemics in a common case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone
The possibilities are few and the total number of rules may be considerably greater
Often therefore there are a number of rules having the same effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite effect
Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number of rules is no greater
The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse function of the size -- smaller systems are more troublesome -- for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity
This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems
The statement of the system is a different matter
Smaller systems can of course be stated much more succinctly
A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics but it can not always be found without morphophonemics
And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics -- at least the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it can not be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures
The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves
There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance
This seems naive
Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies
Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs
The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic esthetics which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried over from European languages
Many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent
Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people `` and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance
As a result many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion
A. E. Sharp in Vowel-Length And Syllabicity In Kikuyu examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail
His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography `` 59
To do so he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail
In the process he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult
A few of his examples are of very great interest and the whole discussion of some importance for theory
His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other
Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness
He concludes that some changes can be made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes
I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles
This however will not exhaust their practical usefulness as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design
We need many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis
One other paper deals with a phonologic problem Vowel Harmony In Igbo by J. Carnochan
This restates the already widely known facts in terms of prosodies
As a restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of Igbo
But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology
The paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional though not structural statement
It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described
But it does not as it claims demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods
It seems to me that it rather easily can
Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems
On the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter
My comments must be briefer than the papers deserve
W. H. Whiteley writes on The Verbal Radical In Iraqw
This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A Short Description Of Item-Categories In Iraqw
It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms
The treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point
There are more stems per item in Athabascan which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier
or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory including three wholly separated areas
or both
The differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample 24 as against 21
On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages
These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison
The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used
These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself within a compact and uniform territorial area but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined
Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal
I one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley
The result is that I included 70 animal names but Swadesh only 4
and somewhat similarly for plants 16 as against 4
Swadesh and therefore Hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ox vulture salmon yellow pine manzanita
their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts fish bird tree grass horn tail bark root
The groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size
Other classes are included only by myself interrogatives adverbs or only by Swadesh and Hoijer pronouns demonstratives
What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes 1 body parts and products which with a proportionally nearly even representation 51 terms out of 253 25 out of 100 come out with nearly even ratios
2.6 and 2.7
2 Nature 29 terms against 17 ratios 3.3 versus 4.1
3 adjectives 16 15 terms ratios 3.9 versus 4.7
4 verbs 9 22 terms ratios 4.0 versus 3.4
It will be seen that where the scope is similar the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 5 except for verbs where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower
This exception may be connected with Hoijer 's use of a much higher percentage of verbs 22 of his total list as against 3.5 in mine
Or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb
More word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question
If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually
Hoijer 's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings with allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly big-large long-far many-much die-dead say-speak
For Yokuts I tabulated these 71 items in five columns according as they were expressed by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stems
The totals for these five categories are not too uneven namely 20 15 11 16 9 respectively
For Athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two of five corresponding columns were identical 1 and 2 stems
the three others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively Af
Af
and Af stems
While the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially arbitrary they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material and they eventuate also in five classes along a similar scale containing approximately equal numbers of cases namely 19 14 15 11 12 in Athabascan
When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or two or three or four we find these differences Af
This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart Af
which divided by Af gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart
If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families the distance would of course be 0
If it were wholly random and unrelated it would be 2.0 assuming the five classes were equal in n which approximately they are
The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement
In 1960 David D. Thomas published Basic Vocabulary In some Mon-Khmer Languages AL 2 No 3 pp 7 11 which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate Af in place of original Af and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy IJAL 21
121 137
Thomas findings are first `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence ``
but second `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence `` as between M-K and I-E
His first conclusion on behavior of individual items is negative whereas mine on Ath and Yok was partially positive
His second conclusion on semantic word classes agrees with mine
This second conclusion independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are can not be ignored
Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence which weights not only the number of stems roots per meaning but their relative frequency
Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning are stem identical in 8 languages 100
stem frequencies 7 and 1 86
stem frequencies 4 and 4 64
stem frequencies 4 3 and 1 57
His formula will have to be weighed may be altered or improved and it should be tested on additional bodies of material
But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance
and Gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area
As to relative frequencies of competing roots 7 1 vs. 4 4 etc Thomas with his weighting seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have
The problem needs further exploration
I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication in which in listing Two-Stem Meanings I set off by asterisks those forms in which N of stem B was Af of stem A/3 the unasterisked ones standing for Af
or under Four Stems I set off by asterisks cases where the combined N of stems Af was Af
These findings and others which will in time be developed will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry
If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly
Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller
And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones
It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items
Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list
It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible
And why that insistence
It is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence
But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare
Not that such a list can not be constructed
but the nearer it comes to attaining universality the less significant will it be linguistically
Its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they will fit actual languages more and more badly
The practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison
The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible
In proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive
An elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious common-sense indubitable identity as do an eye or tooth or nail
They isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence
and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities
With the universal list as his weapon Swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past eight ten twelve millennia back
And he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all Western hemisphere languages
Some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence
But the farther out he moves the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the larger the speculative component in his inferences
He has traversed provinces and kingdoms but he has not consolidated them behind him nor does he control them
He has announced results on Hokan Penutian Uto-Aztecan and almost all other American families and phyla and has diagrammed their degree of interrelation
but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than Salish
That is his privilege
The remote cloudy possible has values of its own -- values of scope stimulus potential and imagination
But there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and elusive external links
of classification first with elapsed age merely a by-product
of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan in Yokuts in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them
This involves step-by-step progress and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry
If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding that is no reason why we should swerve
There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh 's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast
It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble solid and limited basis
I would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list as intrinsically unachievable and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved
I would propose next as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible
There would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable
An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected
Doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies
It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other
When the Yalta Conference opened the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia 's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down
Starting in great force late in December from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder thirty miles from Berlin and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine
The long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia 's advantage
The West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line which was substantially Russia 's 1941 border as the boundary between Russia and Poland
When this proposal was made Stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference
He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject
The bitter memory of Russia 's exclusion from the Paris Peace Conference and of the West 's effort to stamp out Bolshevism at its birth boiled up within him
`` You would drive us into shame `` he declared
The White Russians and the Ukrainians would say that Stalin and Molotov were far less reliable defenders of Russia than Curzon and Clemenceau
Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland in some regions
He did not mind the Line itself which Churchill declared in the House of Commons on February 27 1945 he had always believed to be `` just and right `` but he did not want it called by a hated name
The West had long since forgotten the events of 1919 but it was not so easy for the Red leaders who felt that they had suffered great injustice in that period
In the Dunn-Atherton memorandum of February 4 1942 the State Department had expected to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 boundaries
Now Stalin made it clear that he meant to move Poland 's western borders deep into Germany back to the western Neisse-Oder River lines taking not only East Prussia and all of Silesia but Pomerania and the tip of Brandenburg back to and including Stettin
From six to nine million additional Germans would be evicted though most would have fled and Poland would receive far more from Germany than the poor territories including the great Pripet Marshes which she lost to Russia
Stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little longer `` although it costs us blood `` in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense of the Germans
By this time Churchill was not so cordial toward moving Poland westward as he had been at Teheran where he and Eden had both heartily approved the idea
After `` a prolonged study of the Oder line on a map `` at Teheran Churchill `` liked the picture ``
He would tell the Poles he said that they had been `` given a fine place to live in more than three hundred miles each way ``
At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave trying to find work in Germany and Roosevelt objected to the Western Neisse River being chosen in the south instead of the Eastern Neisse both of which flow into the Oder
The issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace conference
However there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong Poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large minorities of Germans or Russians
The moving of millions of the German master-race from the very heart of Junkerdom to make room for the Polish Slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate was a drastic operation but there was little doubt that it was historically justified
Of more importance to the West than Poland 's boundaries was the character of her government
At Yalta the West still believed that Eastern Europe could be kept in its orbit in spite of the onrushing Soviet armies
Though little democracy had ever been practised in this region and much of it was still ruled by feudalistic means it was taken for granted that at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this area and Western capitalism preserved within it
Believing devoutly as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions it was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that the Poles should have them
The issue was acute because the exiled Polish Government in London supported in the main by Britain was still competing with the new Lublin Government formed behind the Red Army
More time was spent in trying to marry these incompatibles than over any subject discussed at Yalta
The result was an agreement that the Lublin Government should be `` reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the Poles abroad `` and pledged to hold `` free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot ``
All `` democratic and anti-Nazi parties `` were to have the right to campaign
Roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this issue
It was a matter of principle with Churchill since Britain had declared war in behalf of Poland
To Stalin it was a matter of life and death
He made this completely clear
Speaking with `` great earnestness `` he said `` For the Russian people the question of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security
Throughout history Poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia
Twice in the last thirty years our enemies the Germans have passed through this corridor
It is in Russia 's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force
It is necessary that Poland should be free independent in power
Therefore it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the Soviet state ``
In other words the Soviet Union was determined to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the Soviets or posing as an independent balancing power in between Russia and Germany
Byrnes says that invariably thereafter the Soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in Poland
This reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be
Any free elections that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government in which Moscow had complete confidence and all pressure from the West for free voting by anti-Soviet elements in Poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements
In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern Europe where the upper classes had generally collaborated with the Nazis even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into Russia as a part of Hitler 's armies
But at Yalta the conflicting expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe `` to create democratic institutions of their own choice ``
In any case `` here in their judgment conditions require `` italics added they would `` form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive to the will of the people ``
Other similar affirmations in the Declaration on Liberated Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the Western model
Later it developed that the Soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discussed later and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should unite in establishing democratic conditions as we understand them within their zone of influence
Professor McNeill thinks that at Yalta Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him that he thought the exclusion of the anti-Soviet voters from East European elections would not be greatly resented by his allies while neither Roosevelt nor Churchill frankly faced `` the fact that in Poland at least genuinely free democratic elections would return governments unfriendly to Russia `` by any definition of international friendliness
Also war-time propaganda and cooperation had `` obscured the differences between Russian and Western ideas of democracy `` and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil the military victories over Germany and Japan
The application of these formulae could not please both sides for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable
While obliged to concede governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union instead of opposed to it we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in East Europe
This illusion was described in a far-sighted editorial in The New York Herald Tribune on March 5 1947 in connection with the submission of the satellite peace treaties to the Senate
In doing so Marshall and Byrnes were `` asking for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international life ``
We had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world
`` We were troubled about the fate of the Baltic States
Yalta left us with comforting illusions of a Western capitalist-democratic political economy reigning supreme up to the Curzon line and the borders of Bessarabia `` Italics added
This is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion which applied to other areas than East Europe
The same editorial continued that `` We expected to democratize Japan and Korea and to see a new China pattern itself easily on our institutions
We expected in short that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple from such a position to deal with the localized aberrations of the Soviet Union ``
Yet actually `` the image corresponded in no way to the actualities of the post-war world
Neither our military our economic nor our ideological power reached far enough `` to determine the fate of East Europe
Then the editorial added prophetically `` how far they may reach in Asia is yet undetermined but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences ``
Here is the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been written
Failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite treaties President Truman re-declared the Cold War on March 12 1947 in the Truman Doctrine exactly one week after the Herald Tribune editorial was written and a year after the Cold War had been announced by Churchill at Fulton Missouri in Truman 's presence
Then China promptly went Communist and Mr. Truman had to fight the interminable Korean war for the democratization of Korea before we learned how far our writ did `` reach in Asia ``
Years of war strain and hatred
of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the United States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World War 2 -- Communist control of East Europe and China -- a new balance of power
While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame it all on Yalta
Yet in summarizing a series of careful essays on the Yalta Conference Forrest Pogue could find no basis for Yalta becoming `` a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents of Roosevelt and international cooperation ``
When the Yalta Papers were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal by anyone
An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts
First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation planning and discussion
Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes
All political interests supported electoral planning although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination
The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration nomination and voting
Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach
However the regionally differentiated results which appear below in tables are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances
A third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy is the results of the election
The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interested parties including the government itself were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections
The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics
Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence
They were stressed in the speeches of Si Mubarak Bekkai when the first Council of Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council
King Muhammad 5 was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May Day 1957
There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 in which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic
Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 this goal appears somewhat ambitious
From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government
Until the Charter of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes
The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 but the P.D.I Parti Democratique de l'Independance the most important minor party at the time objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil service and influence in Radio Maroc
There were rumors that the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary `` non-political `` process which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings
The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself `` would be supported by the King himself
The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections but French consultants were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time
In January 1958 the Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King the rumors of election dates appeared once again first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer
Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958 the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied
In late 1957 the M.P Mouvement Populaire appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party
The parties were on the whole unprepared for elections while the people were still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after-effects of poor harvests in 1957
Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue
They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May 1958 which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held
But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity `` of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy labor politics and economic development
By December 1958 when Abdallah Ibrahim became President of the Council elections had even greater importance
They were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new constructive national effort
To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed
A titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections
By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete
There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions
From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results
In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental and sometimes bitter differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance
In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent
Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide minority parties such as the P.D.I in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 clamor for elections when out of power but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power
Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process
The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco
At the central level the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political parties
The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections
Although the elections were for local officials it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates
With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly
Both parties and the Ministry of the Interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and thereby give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance
Since a national interpretation can not be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation
The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization
The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not only to party bickering but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections
Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber of Commerce elections which took place three weeks before national elections
The Istiqlal-sponsored U.M.C.I.A L'Union Marocaine Des Commercants Industrialistes et Artisans was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P L'Union National Des Forces Populaires in nearly all urban centers
As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen the U.M.C.I.A was generally favored against the more progressive labor-based U.N.F.P
The newer party campaigned heavily while the older more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years
The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A offices did not campaign and lost heavily
The value of the elections was lost both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest as shown in Table 1
The Chamber of Commerce elections were of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections
The U.N.F.P learned that its urban organization which depends heavily on U.M.T support was most effective
The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete precise problems of internal politics
The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place
A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections
Although a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated
Furthermore the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results
The sine qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure
As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections
The P.D.I and later the Popular Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position `` until the fall of Balafrej and then the Istiqlal used the same argument which it had previously ignored against the pro-U.N.F.P tendencies of the Ibrahim government
The bulk of the preparation had of course proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics
Apart from some areas of recurring trouble like Bani Mellal where inexperienced officials had been appointed there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process
Centrally however the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage
The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council of Government under his personal direction
Although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor
The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders
Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P
Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958
There were three major administrative tasks the fixing of electoral districts the registration of voters and the registration of candidates
Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January 1960
The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response
Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials
A goal was fixed as given in Table 2 and attention focused on its fulfillment
The qualifications to vote were kept very simple
Both men and women of twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification
There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking
The police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities
The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census
Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future
Some vocational training schools provide such training but the current need exceeds the facilities
The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act which provided a continuing annual appropriation of 7 million to support on a matching basis state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture trades industrial skills and home economics
Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program
The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to 29 million in addition to the 7 million under the Smith Act
The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added 5 million for practical nurse training
The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 Title 8 of which amended the George-Barden Act
Annual authorizations of 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians
The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools
The initiative administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts
Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role providing leadership and teacher training
Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure and the state or local districts must pay at least half
The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it
Throughout the history of the program state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures while local districts all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments
Today Federal funds account for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditures for vocational education
The greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds
National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades
During World War 2 about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities 1 Vocational Education for National Defense and 2 War Production Training
The total cost of the five-year program was 297 million
For the Smith-Hughes George-Barden and National Defense Act of 1958 the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about 740 million
No comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training
There are a great number and variety of private commercial schools trade schools and technical schools
In addition many large corporations operate their own formal training programs
A recent study indicated that 85 per cent of the nation 's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations
Most skilled industrial workers nevertheless still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions
The National Manpower Council of Columbia University has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained
There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education
Employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training
Vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills
In most states trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools usually located in the larger cities
In Arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses
In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent
An important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools
For a number of years Kentucky Louisiana and several other states have been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties
These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts
Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts
Courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs
but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses also may be conducted
The Title 8 program of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools
By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states
They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas
An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken
Relation to new industry
Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry
The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a large number of semi-skilled machine operators
A few key skilled workers experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere
A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees
The existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled
Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff and program are in being
Thus besides the training provided to youth in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts
Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry
The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant
Local focus of programs
The major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands
This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country
Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers
All the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs of estimating the growth of local jobs and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content
Furthermore there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys
Local jobs can be seen and counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical
While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning
The U. S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys
This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment
Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills
No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained
Moreover the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary
There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable
Much of the available information comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states
State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities
There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs
A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided
There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence payments and are not guaranteed a job
However there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training
Again one major difficulty is the local focus
A training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community
If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere many more workers can be expected to respond
Another problem is who will pay for the training
Local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training
Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it
Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it
State governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities
Only the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs
If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states
However if Federal funds are used it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment
Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities
A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G. I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate
This probably would require some support for subsistence as well as for tuition but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a Youth Conservation Corps
A maximum of 600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home
A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor
Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training
Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located
This would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative on-the-job and extension training
Personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual
His aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training
But briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences
Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance
And then the application of the count rules to the width horizontally of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline
The very idea of there being `` count rules `` implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway run up or run down movement
This expectation is what really `` sold `` point and figure
But there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense
Experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply and in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events
After all too much does not happen too suddenly nor does very little take long
The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of charting bar charting and point and figure charting remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among their respective professional advocates with both methods enjoying in common one irrevocable merit
They are both trend-following methods
Even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum the `` odds `` still favor them both for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse
Of course many more things are charted besides prices
The foregoing have been methods of charting prices but now let us look at some of the other indices that are customarily charted and which are looked to for their forecasting abilities
The quest for methods
The search for forecasting formulae is ceaseless
Correlations have been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price
The theory behind this is of course fundamentalist in character
As the number of reported freight car loadings increased this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity and consequently increased stock earnings implying fatter dividends and implying therefore increased stock market prices
We now know that things rarely ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion and that car loadings while perhaps interesting enough are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn
But the quest for such an index goes on ceaselessly with all manner of investors and speculators participating ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the proverbial shoe-string operator all seeking doggedly studiously daily -- and often nightly -- for the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal secret Which way will the market move -- up or down
It recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships
Just as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting index
The quest offers careers
Much of this goes on in offices high up in Wall Street 's lofty wind-swept towers
There sit men who make moving averages of weekly volume monthly averages of price-earnings ratios ratios of the number of advances to the number of declines ratios of an individual stock 's performance to overall market performance ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume odd-lot indices and what not
They are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao coffee soybeans cotton tin oats etc
And along Chicago 's West Jackson Boulevard La Salle Street and around the Merchandise Mart Plaza there sit men who chart crop reports who divide the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs and the number of hogs by the amount of corn
They plot the open interest curves rainfall curves and they even divide Democratic congressmen by Republican congressmen
All these things and countless more enter into their calculations and yet the enchanting index remains non-forthcoming
Not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word
The markets are far too subtle and the last word in these endeavors will doubtless never be written for the enchanting index is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth
But whereas civilized men no longer pursue the fountain they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting index
We mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago
In the stock market the normal trading package is a hundred shares just as 5,000 bushels is the standard grain contract package
A stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange
This results in a separate record being made distinguishing these trades from the overall volume of trading
According to the theory underlying odd-lot indices the trader who trades odd lots is most likely a small trader one who ca n't afford to trade round lots
Or to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders
Falling most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this rank of traders can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot traders do marketwise is taken to exemplify the `` wrong `` thing to do
Figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers
Odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their particular statistical recipe
They might for example plot it exactly as is or they might make ten day moving averages of it or longer moving averages or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales
The particular recipe is a matter of individual taste
The data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart usually of a popular stock average
Towards the end of an intermediate or major rise while the top is forming on the price chart it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply
This warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top
Similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood
Thus in the aggregate the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the bottoms notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions
While it had long been known in general that `` the public is always wrong `` the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical basis
One might well wonder why the `` public is always wrong `` and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg
Which came first
Is it really that the `` public `` buys at the tops and not that the market tops out when the `` public `` buys
And the converse at bottoms
Does the `` public `` usually sell at bottoms or does the market usually bottom out when the `` public `` sells
We have been using the word `` public `` in quotation marks that is in its vernacular connotation with reference to the odd-lot index theory
Obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa
And while all concerned are members of the literal public somewhat less than all concerned although still a majority form the quotation marked `` public ``
And the public minus the `` public `` leaves the so-called `` sophisticated `` element -- the element on the other end of the `` public 's `` transactions
This element is often called `` strong hands ``
Strong hands differ from `` weak hands `` in that their operations are the primary movers
They initiate campaigns so to speak even if this initiation is diffused among them and their concerted action only psychologically organized
Strong hands act
weak hands react
Strong hands move first
weak hands ask What is going on
When strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even in the face of bearish news reports
They are able to sit more patiently with what they have bought
Needless to say strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up at higher prices during the run-up phase of the campaign
Certain badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces
But after all can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these things were true
Try to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose and the majority would make consistent profits
How much and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few
Moreover the taunt concerning the `` sophisticated `` echelon and its alleged erudition is put to test during every campaign and accrues only upon results
not before
It quite often happens that campaigns go askew resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands into played-out hands just as a member of a former campaign 's `` public `` may emerge flatteringly `` right `` the next time
Membership in the echelons fluctuates too
The study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow what with all observers trying to get on the side of the `` few `` at the same time
The usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis as well declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use
It has to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word `` few ``
Diametric opposition must persist as to the future course of prices if there is to persist a market at all
And the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all and is in fact unimaginable
There need be no squeamishness about admitting this
Anyone still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority loses
Mr. John Magee whose work has been discussed in this chapter was quoted in a New Yorker Magazine profile as saying `` Of course you have to remember it 's a good thing for us chartists that there are n't more of us
If you got too many people investing by this method their operations would begin to affect stock prices and thus throw the charts off
The method would become self-defeating ``
Mr. Alexander H. Wheelan 's Study Helps In Point And Figure Technique tells the readers `` We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities markets ``
What with traders trading for so many different objectives and what with there being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading techniques in use and more coming into use all the time it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` fans `` to invalidate itself
Nevertheless all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible modes of expression if they lead to a market committment at all
In the final analysis then the user becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate
Thus while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it is commonplace for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed
Though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the possible conclusions remain but two
Chapter 6 more methods
The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead
In assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961 the question as always is the prospect for general business activity
By and large what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates
Moreover the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal monetary and other Federal policies which affect interest rates
Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity
During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy
The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident
Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer
It is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust
The rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some decline
In earlier business cycles when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain
At this time however there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction
These signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments 7.6 in September
On the other hand in a more favorable vein general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising Federal spending and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course
The 2 increase in retail sales in October to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference Board which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans
The pattern of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way
The recovery will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit as well as by an expansion of Government spending well sustained consumer spending and some rebuilding of business inventories
Slight downward pressure
What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961
It suggests that during the next several months through the spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower especially the rates on Federal state and local bonds as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds
However as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great
It seems likely moreover that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions interest rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate e.g easier downpayment and amortization terms
If the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here we are likely to see additional steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit
Certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the banking system
However the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow of gold as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle
Open market policy
One of the most intriguing questions is whether the recent departures of the Federal Reserve authorities from confining their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread into longer-term Government securities in the next few months
To the extent that the new Administration has its wishes the Federal Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of Government securities and aggressively seek to force down long-term interest rates
The principle of `` bills only `` or `` bills preferably `` seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities
However to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market operations in longer-term Government bonds they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces
By the end of the spring of 1961 assuming that a general business recovery gets under way interest rates should begin to edge upward again depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to restrain credit availability
My guess would be that interest rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the downturn
It is pertinent to ask the question Has the long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates
My answer is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels
Five basic forces
This view is based upon several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in the Sixties as follows 1
Recent events in the General Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us and probably intensify for the foreseeable future
This makes it certain that Federal expenditures for military preparedness and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years
We are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new African nations against the ruthless competition of the Communist bloc
Our efforts to overcome the lead of the Russians in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending
Moreover it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education housing medical aid and the like
There are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures of which I take a dim view but it seems very likely to occur
2
During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping up in the rate of household formations which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building
According to the latest projections of the Bureau of the Census the annual rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years
Under the most favorable assumptions for increase the Bureau of the Census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise from about 883,000 in the last two years of the Fifties to an annual rate of about 1,018,000 in the first five years of the Sixties and to a slightly higher annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the decade
During the Seventies the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of 1,338,000 in the second half of that decade
Accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospects of the Sixties
However the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated
The average annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1,525,000 in the three-year period from April 1947 to March 1950
3
With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated
This is an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand
State and local expenditures in real terms increased persistently from 26.5-billion in 1949 to 44.3-billion in 1959 and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade which would carry them to the neighborhood of 75-billion by 1970
Here would be a powerful force for raising business activity
4
It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties
Spurred by keen competition in our industrial system and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade
5
In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was dammed-up during the Thirties and World War 2 is finally in the process of running dry
There is some clear-cut evidence of this
For example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the VA home loan guaranty program seems to have largely exhausted itself
Indeed the failure of home-building as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings may also signal in part that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an end
In a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted in the Fifties
The huge backlog of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the War was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the War and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields
The consuming public has used up a good part of these liquid assets or they have been drained by the rising price level and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier
This is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties
I am confident that it will but consumer spending in the Sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the Fifties
Markets should become more competitive as consumers become more selective
Sixties capital requirements
Accordingly during the Sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the Fifties and in the process to require enormous amounts of capital funds
Wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases
The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries
While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2
Indeed the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented
The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny
Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing `` and `` entry-limiting `` prices due to fears of public reaction the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands
The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition and an exploration of some of its implications
In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call the effect of `` public-limit pricing `` on `` key `` wage bargains we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces such as union power which may be relevant in an actual situation
For expository purposes this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages
Part 1 below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions
Part 2 discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions
Part 3 discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions
Part 4 is a brief summary
The Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument but is best read after Part 1 in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit
1 the assumptions of the model
The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry producing a substantial share of gross national product
Price competition is lacking
For the purposes of setting the product price the industry behaves as a single entity
In wage negotiations the industry bargains as a unit with a single union
The demand for the industry 's product
We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry 's product
The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given
In any given time period the aggregate demand for the industry 's product is determined by two things the price charged by the industry and the level of Aj
For the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables since GNP includes other prices
We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately
The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of Aj
Industry product price policy
The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest
Because of its importance and because the lack of price competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases
The threat of effective anti-trust action provoked by `` gouging the public `` through price increases not justified by cost increases and fears of endangering relations with customers Congress the general public and the press all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases
For the industry of this model the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing price given the wage rate and the level of GNP and even below the entry-limited price but not below average cost
For such an industry it is only `` safe `` to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified `` by rising costs due to rising wages etc
Thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate
In this model we abstract from all non-wage sources of cost changes so that the `` public-limit price `` only rises as the wage rate rises
In such circumstances it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate
Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated and is likely to remain well above the latter
The entry-limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition but unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy we might expect the public-limit price to approach the entry-limit price
The foreign-entry-limit price would be approached more rapidly since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign costs directly
Where this approach becomes critical the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting `` the wage pressures of a powerful union requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly `` acceded to the union pressure
Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase
The extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things the passage of time the level of GNP and the size of the wage increase
We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry
The industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure on the union but in order to `` educate `` the government and the customers of the industry
As a strike continues these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement
They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail
Public indignation and resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 per annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 per month
The simple passage of an additional eleven months time makes the second 3 boost more acceptable
Thus the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase
Notice however that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per se without an accompanying wage increase
Similarly higher levels of GNP do not in themselves provide grounds for raising prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase
This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP however -- only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage-price increases
Finally since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases e.g if a wage increase of 5 allows a price increase of 7 a wage increase of 10 allows a price increase of something less than 14
We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced the average cost curve is horizontal and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve and is the same for every firm and therefore for the industry
The level of this average cost is determined by factor prices technology and so forth
As we have noted however we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate
The level of average cost equal to marginal cost is thus strictly a function of the wage rate
Union policies and collective bargaining issues
The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate
The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment
The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases but we abstract from these forces here
For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs
Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry much less to the union or to the public
Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared
The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage rate
We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate increases and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real `` wage rate
For internal political reasons the union asks for and accepts increases in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry
Changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and they constitute an argument for raising prices
However it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude
In this model then the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 below find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise
Thus for non-negative changes in the basic wage rate the industry becomes the active wage-setter since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence
The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on the grounds that it is `` clearly `` not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously
From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model
It is this conclusion that we challenge
we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based
2 the operation of the model
It is convenient to assume that the union-industry contract is of one year 's duration
In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law
Several factors contributed to this change
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow
Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe but for the world
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century
International law had to fit the conditions of Europe and nothing that could not fit this system or the interests of the great European nations collectively could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense
Essentially this imposed two conditions First international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive suspicious and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another
second it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared
In both respects international law was Europeanized
It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions
On the one hand the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality -- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment `` that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience
But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world
Thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere
Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power `` system in Europe was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance `` itself
A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality
more doubtful but possible with an assist from the North was the neutralization of the Latin American countries
out of the question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa
This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19th century scholars
More emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` civilized nations ``
Kent and Story the great early American scholars repeatedly made use of this phrase or of `` Christian nations `` which is a substantial equivalent
Wheaton stated that the public law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin ``
Of course it had always been of European origin in fact but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory
Now with virtually every writer not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others
The European customs on which international law was based were to become by force and fiat the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states
Hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law-governed countries
They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter or some of them which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction ``
During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers though ineffectively just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them with more effect today
A number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international law
that is from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states
The difference is important for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among sovereigns this was by no means its exclusive domain
The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a conceptually unified system
The theory of international law which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America broke this unity and this universality
It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations
No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do
his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action
To appreciate this development we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy
First and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state and the individual 's identification with the state as transcending other ties of social solidarity
National identification was not new but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred
It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will `` put forward by the Germans especially by Hegel although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes
National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law domestic and international simply as its formal reflection
In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek 's auto-limitation
A state the highest form of human organization in fact and theory could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will or consent
According to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign `` in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors
He no longer sought to find the law
he made it
he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be
There was no law domestic or international except that willed by acknowledged by or consented to by states
Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence
Related to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another
Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions
The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions
Law became a conscious process something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms
Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed
The old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no longer adequate to the task
First was the period of codification of existing law the Code Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification that in fact resulted from Austin 's restatement and ordering of the Common Law in England
Codification was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation some changing and adjusting the older law much dealing with entirely new situations
The legislative mills have been grinding ever since and when its cumbersome processes were no longer adequate to the task a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another to the executive
Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law
Indeed with developed positivism the separation of law from justice or from morality generally became quite specific
In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament -- the elected representatives -- at the expense of the more conservative judiciary
When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit -- when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands -- two purposes were served Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will and law became a rational system for implementing that will for serving conscious goals for embodying the `` public policy ``
It is true that initially the task was to remove restrictions that it was thought inhibited the free flow of money goods and labor
but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy
Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will ``
However the sovereign was not Hobbes absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin
It was too an optimistic philosophy and though it separated law from morality it was by no means an immoral or amoral one
Man through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom was master of his destiny
The theory did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a Hegelian mystique
It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government
It was not opposed to either justice or morality
it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority
Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society
To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie and this objective required that governmental authority -- administrative officials and judges -- be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible
that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated
that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market
that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with
Contract -- conceived as the free bargain of formal equals -- replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status-conscious society
Indeed contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone of the free society
Government itself was based upon contract
business organization -- the corporation -- was analyzed in contractual terms
trade was based on freedom of contract and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms
even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement
It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract
In fact some -- Anzilotti is the principle example -- went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal norm Pacta sunt Servanda
The displacement at least to a considerable extent of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law theory and doctrine
In the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system
One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations
Admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law of Nations and made dependent on the several national laws
Private international law which Americans call the `` conflict of laws `` was thus segregated from international law proper or as it is often called public international law
States were free to enact within broad though perhaps determinate limits their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas
The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation and then largely in marginal situations
Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 power
In this view supported by only three members of the Court a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 was granted by the generality of Article 1
If this seems arbitrary its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction
Federal question jurisdiction
For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts subject to review by the Supreme Court for the protection of most rights arising under national law
Then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions
One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference
Serious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process
An amendment presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves became a `` laissez-faire `` limitation upon state economic policy
A flood of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government
Congress reacted with a series of measures modifying in various ways what it had granted in 1875
In 1910 it required the convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the Supreme Court
Such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter
In 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction proceedings upon institution of state court test cases
The essential ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate orders
Three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions against collection of state taxes
This saved for state adjudication in the first instance the two major areas where federal injunctions had been most obnoxious but other areas remained vulnerable
Meanwhile the Supreme Court like Congress showed misgivings concerning this aspect of government by injunction
Drawing upon the traditional discretion of the chancellor Mr. Justice Holmes introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter 's famous doctrine of abstention
Whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state remedies the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue
The classic case is Railroad Commission v. Pullman
The commission had issued an administrative order which was challenged as discriminatory against Negroes
Its enforcement was enjoined by a federal trial court
On review the Supreme Court via Mr. Justice Frankfurter found southern racial problems `` a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to adjudication is open ``
An alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether the offending order had in fact been authorized
Reluctant as usual to interpret state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` forecast rather than a determination `` -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter led a unanimous Court to vacate the injunction
But it is crucial that here unlike Burford the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question
`` The resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication ``
Temporary abstention i.e postponement is one thing
refusal to adjudicate is another
To the extent that the jurisdictional principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation federal equitable relief against state action must be available -- or so it seems to Mr. Justice Frankfurter
In Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern Ry Co. the commission had refused to permit abandonment of certain `` uneconomic `` train facilities
The railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process of law sought injunctive relief
The Court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be obstructed
this in the name of equitable discretion
Justices Frankfurter and Jackson concurred in the Court 's result for they found no merit in the railroad 's claim
But they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of Congress
`` By one fell swoop the Court now finds that Congress indulged in needless legislation in the acts of 1910 1913 1925 1934 and 1937
By these measures Congress so the Court in effect now decides gave not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the Act of 1875 against all proceedings challenging local regulation ``
A most revealing recent case is Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills
The Taft-Hartley Act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over `` suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce ``
On its face this merely provides a federal forum
it does not establish any law rights for the federal judges to enforce
How can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when Congress has created none
The Court held that Congress had intended the federal judiciary to `` fashion `` an appropriate law of labor-management contracts
In short congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not create or specify the right to be enforced
The Lincoln Mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal `` common law `` which as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in dissent leads to one of the following `` incongruities `` `` 1 conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements
2 displacement of state law by federal law in state courts in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements
or 3 exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters ``
The Justice 's elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that Congress purpose was merely to make unions suable
With a few exceptions the lawmakers seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved -- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges
To avoid these constitutional difficulties Mr. Justice Frankfurter was prepared to read the Taft-Hartley provision as concerned with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction
This would satisfy what presumably was Congress major purpose -- the suability of unions
It would also leave intact the states traditional authority in the realm of contract law
As we have seen the Erie and York decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state decisional rules
Here again Mr. Justice Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation
If Congress wants to displace the states from areas which they have customarily occupied let it do so knowingly and explicitly
And let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judges
Does Lincoln Mills suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages
There is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases
Congress has not clearly defined the bounds between state and federal court competence
It has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a case-by-case basis
A careful student has suggested that `` In any new revision of the Judicial Code the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law might be used leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation of pronouncing state law ``
Obviously the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in Mr. Justice Frankfurter 's opinions -- to the extent that Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion
The same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in the FELA certiorari cases in the administrative law area and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review
Mr. Justice Black no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and `` just `` result
He will not be `` fooled by technicalities ``
Federal review of state decisions
With few exceptions Congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising under federal law
To put it differently state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right
To insure uniformity in the meaning of national law however state interpretations are subject to Supreme Court review
It may be noted parenthetically that to evade `` desegregation `` an ex-Justice and former southern governor has urged Congress to abolish this reviewing authority
The result of course would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states
It would also probably mean different things within the same state -- depending upon what court state or federal rendered decision
We consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial federal-state relationship
The first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance
Subject to certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials each level of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures
Litigants who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure
A similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals e.g in diversity cases
In an FELA controversy the state court followed established state procedure by construing a vague complaint `` most strongly against `` the complainant
In other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the pleader by state law
The result was that the plaintiff 's case was dismissed
Mr. Justice Black led a reversing majority `` Strict local rules of pleading can not be used to impose unnecessary burdens upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law ``
Here as in the Byrd case another element of state procedure was subsumed to federal judge-made law
Justices Frankfurter and Jackson dissented `` One State may cherish formalities more than another one State may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms
If a litigant chooses to enforce a Federal right in a State court he can not be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated -- the particularity for instance with which a cause of action must be described
Federal law though invoked in a State court delimits the Federal claim -- defines what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it
But the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it so long as a requirement does not add to or diminish the right as defined by Federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities of litigation ``
Another problem in the area of federal-state relationships is this what constitutes reversible error in a state decision
Terminiello v. Chicago involved a conviction for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance
The conduct in question was a speech
The accused did not object to the trial court 's charge to the jury that discourse `` may constitute a breach of the peace if it stirs the public to anger invites dispute brings about a condition of unrest
'' For present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal Constitution
Though the accused raised many other objections he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings
That is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right
How else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium section 381 c 9 but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses
or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization section 381 c 16 but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it
or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation section 381 c 6 but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization
or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company section 381 c 14 but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes
These items and most of the others listed above seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381
There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities
With respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 c viewed in historical perspective suggest a rule requiring survival whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation
To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication if not the language of the statute
It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor 's tax attributes
Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone
it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report
and in at least one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code
Section 203 of the United States Code voids an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed the amount due has been ascertained and a warrant for its payment has been issued
If it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section 381 a
A clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation
The leading case Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor and it has been consistently followed
The Court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties one of them a stranger to the claim and to prevent traffic in claims particularly tenuous claims against the Government
Neither reason said the Court applied to the case at hand
furthermore Congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states
Other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors corporate dissolutions transfers by descent or transfers by subrogation
Exceptions are often classified as transfers by `` operation of law ``
A tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an `` operation of law `` mold
Although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash to which section 203 quite clearly applies the courts and Treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund of taxes paid by transferors
A recent case in point is Mitchell Canneries v. United States in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership whose partners were former stockholders and then to another corporation formed by the partners
Holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim the Court cited the Seaboard Novo Trading and Roomberg cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the statute ``
In an earlier case Kingan Co. v. United States an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the British corporation
The anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the American corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the British corporation
The transaction presumably would have qualified under section 368 a 1 as a contractual reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation but not under section 368 a 1 as a statutory merger of consolidation
The Court nevertheless relied on the Seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders of the two corporations were the same
In substance said the Court there was no transfer of equitable title
The Treasury arrives at substantially the same conclusion but skirts the problem of section 203 of the United States Code
Revenue Ruling 54-17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax followed by the name of the successor corporation
Proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed
If the succession is a matter of public record certificates of the Secretaries of State or other public officials having custody of the documents will suffice
if the succession is not of record all documents relating to such succession properly certified are required
The former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition
The Ruling would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for cash
A recent Ruling although rather confusing cites and follows Rev Rul 54-17
The Ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization
Hence a successor corporation in a C reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the merged corporation despite section 203
In a B reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation those cases which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor
In fact a cash purchase of a corporation 's stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the Kimbell-Diamond doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step
These results appear sound
As stated in Seaboard and numerous other cases the two primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the United States Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims on a contingent-fee basis
The cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed
The first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section 381 a which is the only type presently under discussion
Section 381 a applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger or consolidation an acquisition of substantially all a corporation 's assets solely in exchange for voting stock or a change of identity form or place of organization
In virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated and its former stockholders either own outright or have a continuing stock interest in the assets which gave rise to the tax
In these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote
Furthermore in a C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger to which the statute is clearly inapplicable
Nor is it at all likely that a `` desperate `` claim against the Government will be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization
If the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes
If such an unlikely transaction were to take place it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary followed by liquidation
In the rare case where a corporation 's only substantial asset or its most important one is a claim for refund perhaps its transfer should not be permitted whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock
It appears then that although the matter is not dealt with in section 381 c a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section 381 a is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation
Section 203 of the United States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the Government transferred in tax-free reorganizations
The successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims
Other tax attributes of the transferor
There are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved
For example property `` used in the trade or business `` of a transferor corporation as defined in section 1231 presumably would not retain its special status following a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation
The parent of a group filing consolidated returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section 368 a 1 but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not for example elected to file consolidated returns with its own subsidiaries
Similar considerations presumably made it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting section 381 c 4 or depreciation section 381 c 6
Other sections of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provide for survival of certain of a transferor 's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization
Section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation 's basis for property transferred and section 1223 provides for tacking on the transferor 's holding period for such property to that of the transferee
Section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period
However a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for a person acquiring emergency facilities
Attributes similar to a loss carryover
There may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items
For example suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted providing for carryover of excess profits credits
This carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover
It is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income
it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax
Under the 1939 Code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the Stanton Brewery case but only over the dissent of Judge Learned Hand who wrote the majority opinion in the Sansome case a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization
Since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954 one can not say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have
With respect to this type of item one might properly apply the language of the Committee Report quoted above which cautions against using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein
Actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover
Probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax avoidance
Reasons for selecting mail questionnaire method
There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available 1 interviews in depth with a few selected companies and 2 the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire
While the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company 's practices and opinions it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies
As a result it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government
It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature
It is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations
There is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents
Simple `` yes `` or `` no `` answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have
A respondent may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question
There is also the problem of the respondent 's frame of reference
Is the respondent making a recommendation for his own benefit for the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific government department or service for the benefit of the defense program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the taxpayers
There is also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on factual information and carefully considered judgment or whether his answers were casual guesses
Finally there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held -- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the alternatives
The research team was very mindful of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire
Under the circumstances however the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point
In the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered and the structure and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations
Design of the questionnaire
The questionnaire was designed to elicit three types of information 1 the facts regarding certain characteristics of the respondents including their experience with and interest in securing defense business
2 the actual selling and buying practices of the respondents
and 3 the attitudes and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and the methods of awarding defense contracts
It was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did
The major sections of the questionnaire see Appendix B are devoted to the following 1
Information for classifying respondents Part A of the questionnaire 2
Characteristics of defense sales activities Part B of the questionnaire 3
Respondents practices in participating in advertised bidding for defense business Part C of the questionnaire 4
Respondents practices in participating in negotiated bidding for defense purposes Part D of the questionnaire 5
Respondents opinions regarding advertised bidding Part E of the questionnaire 6
Respondents opinions regarding negotiated bidding Part F of the questionnaire 7
Respondents preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense contracts Part G of the questionnaire
The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was optional
The questionnaire also stated that in any event all replies would be treated confidentially
It is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves
Preparation and pretest of the questionnaire
The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months
In June 1960 an early draft of the questionnaire along with a cover letter was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of Washington
Several days after the companies had received the questionnaire members of the research team contacted the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have experienced in completing the questionnaire
This test resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire
The research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might not be typical of those throughout the country or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made
Accordingly another test of the questionaire was made
The revised draft was mailed in July 1960 to 100 firms throughout the United States
Fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3,500 names submitted by member companies of the Aerospace Industries Association AIA list and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of 1,500 names compiled by the research team from the Thomas Register TR list
The method of compiling the AIA and TR lists will be described later
Ten days after the questionnaires were mailed follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once
Twenty-eight returns in all were received
The responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent
The cover letter questionnaire and follow-up postcard were then revised into final form see Appendixes A B and C
Compilation of mailing lists
The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs
The firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind
Three lists of companies were made and used in the study
The first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of Washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work
The primary consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers
The second list was derived from a group of approximately 8,000 names supplied to the research team by the Aerospace Industries Association
These names were secured from member companies by the Association from the forty-four sources listed in Appendix Aj
Each source selected from its approved bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems
Where possible the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address
The forty-four lists supplied by the AIA member companies were merged and duplicate names were eliminated
There was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive
The remaining names were then checked against the Thomas Register list see below and duplicate names were removed from the AIA lists
By these steps the final AIA list was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500
The third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the Thomas Register
It was compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the Aerospace Industries Association were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs
Such a difference might have resulted from 1
The fact that the Aerospace Industries Association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs
The fact that companies on the AIA lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection
Accordingly as `` in-group `` they might have different opinions and practices than an `` out-group `` composed of those companies not so participating but interested in defense business
The fact that AIA lists might not have been selected on a random basis
The control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical listing of manufacturers in the Thomas Register
If the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted
Fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion
Mailing the questionnaire
Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm
The questionnaires were mailed in Seattle Washington and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of Idaho Montana Oregon and Washington
Airmail was used for the addresses outside the Pacific Northwest
Each letter contained a postage-prepaid return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the Pacific Northwest and by airmail for those outside the Pacific Northwest
Approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed a follow-up airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names
The first test mailing to 14 companies was made in June 1960
The second test mailing to 100 companies was made in July 1960
The final mailing of the questionnaire was made late in August 1960 to 4,900 firms consisting of 3,450 from the AIA list and 1,450 from the TR list
Over 1,000 returns were received within two weeks after the final mailing was made
They continued to arrive until the end of December 1960 by which time a total of 1,343 returns were received representing 26.8 per cent of the 5,014 questionnaires sent out
Fifty-seven returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed
The remaining 1,286 returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 2
Processing the returns
Each questionnaire was audited for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a serial number by the source list from which the company name was selected and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark on the return envelope
All responses except comments were numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment
The codes were key-punched into IBM punch cards and verified
Each return required three cards and involved key punching 228 digital columns
In order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate serial number of the respondent
The cards were then processed using standard IBM punch card equipment including an IBM 650 computer
The first step in processing was to analyze the returns from Questions 1 2 and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses in accordance with the definitions contained in ASPR Section 1-701
see Chapter 2
The results are shown in Table 3
The returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms
The second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the AIA list with those from companies on the TR list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study
The methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix Aj
It was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in or wishing to sell to defense programs
In the first place the two groups of firms when combined had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the AIA list alone
The vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world
During the summer of 1960 it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle
The contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee AWOC of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State
By virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces
It is not a pleasant or easy position but one we have endeavored to maintain
We have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose
Inevitably one side was pleased and the other displeased regardless of how we ruled
Often the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other
We have consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding
It is disconcerting nevertheless to read in a labor weekly `` Perluss knuckles down to growers `` and then to be confronted with a growers publication which states `` Perluss recognizes obviously phony and trumped-up strikes as bona fide ``
For a number of years there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers
These attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons
They were inadequately financed without experienced leadership and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole
This past year the pattern has been different The organizing program had the full support of the AFL-CIO which supplied staff and money to the AWOC as well as moral support
Leadership was experienced and skillful and financial resources were significant
Regardless of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life
As a result of these changed conditions the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations has been much greater than in the past
The AWOC has been able to employ the traditional weapons of labor -- the strike and the picket line -- with considerable success particularly in the area of wages
By the very nature of the situation it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management
To date at least the strategy of the AWOC has been selective
that is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the State
Primarily we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program
Normally because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the Unemployment Insurance Code although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility
But the current issues arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists and out of Public Law 78 and the Migrant Labor Agreement if Mexican nationals were employed at the ranch
Most of us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser Act in its historical sense as a major milestone in the development of public placement services
Infrequently do we think of it as a living continuing operating control over the system
However when labor disputes arise its provisions come clearly into play
California has accepted the provisions of that Act as have all other States by enacting into our Code Section 2051 a provision that
The State of California accepts the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act and will observe and comply with the requirements of that act
With respect to labor disputes the Wagner-Peyser Act states only
In carrying out the provisions of this Act the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they are referred to employment
Other provisions of the Act empower the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions and he has done so
The pertinent regulation for our purposes is Section 602.2 as follows
Referrals in labor dispute situations
No person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which 1 is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute or 2 the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute
With respect to positions not covered by subparagraph 1 or 2 of this paragraph any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral
In analyzing this regulation let us take the last sentence first
It permits referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute
Assume for example a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields
The packing shed workers go on strike
There is no dispute involving fieldwork
We concluded that we may refer workers to the fieldwork but not the packing shed work provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute
So far no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision
It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue
Note that it prohibits referrals under either condition 1 or condition 2
Employer representatives have contended that the Secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the grounds that the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists
The matter got into the courts this way One of the early strikes called by the AWOC was at the DiGiorgio pear orchards in Yuba County
We found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute
Accordingly under clause 1 of the Secretary 's Regulation we suspended referrals to the employer
Incidentally no Mexican nationals were involved
The employer seeking to continue his harvest challenged our right to cease referrals to him and sought relief in the Superior Court of Yuba County
The court issued a temporary restraining order directing us to resume referrals
We of course obeyed the court order
However the Attorney General of California at the request of the Secretary of Labor sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the Federal District Court on grounds that it was predominantly a Federal issue since the validity of the Secretary 's Regulation was being challenged
However the Federal Court held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act into its own Code and presumably therefore also the regulations it was now a State matter
It accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction whereupon the California Superior Court made the restraining order permanent
Under that order we have continued referring workers to the ranch
A similar case arose at the Bowers ranch in Butte County and the Superior Court of that county issued similar restraining orders
The growers have strenuously argued that I should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the Secretary 's Regulation
I can not accept that view either as a lawyer or as an administrator
First let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved
It is an accepted juridical principle in California that a Superior Court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent
It is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard
It is not binding upon another Superior Court which could rule to the contrary
Only when a decision is rendered by the District Court of Appeal or of course the Supreme Court is a binding precedent established
In that event we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other Superior Courts
But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior Courts which in effect nullify the Secretary 's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary 's power under the Federal law
I believe I am in good company in this view
The Attorney General of California concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the District Court of Appeal
The Attorney General of the United States in considering the power of the Secretary to issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers has rendered an opinion sustaining his authority
Further and as an evidence of legislative intent only the Senate of the United States recently defeated by a substantial majority the `` Holland Amendment `` to the Fair Labor Standards Act which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the Secretary in these matters
Next let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals
There is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in midair
The ramifications of the issue are enormous
A decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers
The public interest is so dominant in such an issue that I can not be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior Courts in the State
It is an issue which may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial finality is achieved
As an administrator I can not place the Employment Service in California in jeopardy of being out of compliance with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me
To have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court in my opinion would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor were he so inclined to notify the Governor of such noncompliance set a date for hearing and issue his finding
The impact of noncompliance under the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear the withdrawal of some 11 million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or as a corollary the taking over by the Federal Government of its operation
Thus far the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike -- condition 1 in the Regulation of the Secretary
None has yet arisen under condition 2 relating to referral to jobs `` the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute ``
Here the problem is essentially one of defining the word `` filling ``
Should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job specifications union membership union jurisdiction and the like
Or should it have a broader connotation of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of `` filling `` the job
Because of the uncertainty of this definition I solicited the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor
He has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper one
that is that if wages for example is the only issue in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute we may continue to make referrals
Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them
After they have developed concepts they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects
they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely
The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age
One experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years
Many studies indicate that elementary-school children 's interests cover the whole field of science
that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events
and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden
How a child feels about himself about other people and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics
A considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects
Emotional maturity is the result of many factors the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child 's life
However the teacher who understands the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence security and satisfaction
Concerning this responsibility of the teacher suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 11
The following generalizations about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school children may be helpful
Typically the young child 's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time as contrasted to those of an adult
As the child grows older his emotional reactions lead to `` moods `` or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly rather than in short abrupt outbursts
Studies of the growth and decline of children 's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects noises falling and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years but that fears of the dark of being alone and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase
Ridiculing a child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem
more effective solutions include explanations the example of another child or conditioning by associating the feared object place or person with something pleasant
Children need help in learning to control their emotions
The young child learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums screaming kicking and hitting will not get him what he wants
the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers and therefore makes a real effort to control his emotions
Children differ widely in their emotional responses
Among infants the patterns of emotional responses are similar
as the influence of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior becomes individualized
Although no national norms exist for the social development of children the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels
The following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children
the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals struggling to meet their developmental needs and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which they hold membership
During early childhood children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children
after they have been in school a few years their interest in playmates of their own age increases and their interest in adults decreases
the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family gatherings now considers it a bore
In late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase
the group sets the styles in clothing the kind of play engaged in and the ideals of right and wrong behavior
In early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older who can do the things he likes to do
such factors as sex intelligence and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time
In later childhood an interest in team games replaces individual play
loyalty to the group a feeling of superiority over those who are not members and unwillingness to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits
During early childhood boys tease and bully on the average more than girls
those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do well-adjusted children
During late childhood boys like to tease jostle and talk smart to girls
girls who are more mature than boys frown upon the youthful antics of boys of their own age
By the time pupils reach the sixth grade their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed
they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problems but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work
Between the ages of two and four years negativism or resistance to adult authority is noticeable
after the fourth year it begins to decline
However as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers
The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups
The child in the primary grades can play harmoniously with one companion but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger
he wants to be with people but he has n't yet learned to cooperate
In the middle grades however he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader helping to make plans and carry on group activities and setting up rules governing the enterprise
Why the teacher should study the individual pupil
Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program
Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit
others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom
These children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand
Many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists
These specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children
It is the classroom teacher however who has daily contacts with pupils and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice
Indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional chore
Teachers and administrators in many elementary schools have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals
What they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success and that they still must be treated as individuals
Although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability background and experience
Factors that inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment
Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects
One study which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity
It is apparent therefore that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children
When a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning insecurity unhappiness and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow
These maladjustments in turn inhibit learning and a vicious cycle is completed
It is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or that the child who lacks interest in school who dislikes the teacher or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent
The causes of retardation and maladjustment may be found in physical factors such as defective speech or hearing impaired vision faulty motor coordination a frail constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunctioning
They may be caused by poor health habits such as faulty eating and sleeping habits
They may be related to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work
The curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others
Teaching methods learning materials and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children
Unwholesome family relations broken homes and undesirable community influences may also be contributing factors
This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children
Moreover these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner
A vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading disability for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading
An impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school
At any rate the teacher who recognizes common causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment
Sources of information about children
Successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment
The classroom teacher can not be expected to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist
he can not be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom
He can be expected however to examine and interpret the information already available
to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children
and to utilize opportunities arising in connection with regular classroom activities for gaining a better understanding of his pupils
This section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher
Chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil progress
Most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils
These records when systematically maintained provide much information about the children which the teacher can use in guidance instruction grouping and reporting to parents
Each teacher has in his classroom a metal file equipped with a lock which is used to store cumulative record folders
During summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal
Only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records
Each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date
Some school systems provide written instructions to principals and teachers designating when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used
The Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region 1959 1960 `` clearly shows two pieces of information
The Summary Report which was prepared for this Conference indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing
second that both actual and pending desegregation is with few exceptions the product or result of court order
The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow
The Middle-South Region as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials NAIRO consists of the states of Kentucky Maryland Tennessee West Virginia Delaware Virginia and the District of Columbia
The states and the Nation 's Capital all have some desegregation in fact some dating back to 1954
but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition
Desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance interposition pupil assignment with no assignments of Negro children and hate bombings
Desegregation and court order
Now let 's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order
First Kentucky
Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties which already had high school desegregation
The action was a result of a court order the citation for which and for other court action mentioned in this paper is taken from the Summary Report for this Conference
In Maryland the Harford County Board of Education had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but which a plaintiff had challenged
thus county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation
Additional school desegregation in Tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel
Similarly further desegregation may come from suits pending in three Tennessee cities Chattanooga Knoxville and Memphis
In West Virginia the number of white and Negro children attending the same school has increased almost twofold
There are no court decisions here
As in Maryland a District court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in Delaware
As a result of the State Board of Education plan Negro children entered heretofore white elementary schools in five districts
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan
In Virginia court orders led to desegregation in Charlottesville and Floyd Counties
Desegregation in Pulaski County is pending because of court order although date of admission is not yet determined
Negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in Alexandria Arlington Fairfax and Warren Counties
Desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs against school boards in Newport News Fairfax County Arlington County and Norfolk
As a school district the District of Columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 shortly after the Supreme Court decision
This recapitulation makes it clear that school desegregation continues including the Old Dominion State in spite of its stern resistance
The record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order
that on the immediate horizon if further large-scale relatively speaking desegregation comes it will result from court orders on suits filed in several Middle-South states
Knowledge that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow
Before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this Regional Conference I wish to note a small item in the Summary Report as it refers to the District of Columbia
That reference in the Report is `` continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro school system `` a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of Negro school population from 74.1 per cent to 76.7 per cent
I see no real prospects for an all-Negro school population
West of Rock Creek Park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of Georgetown 's conversion-by-renovation housing program
Nearby Foggy Bottom is ousting Negroes
The large acreage in the Southwest Redevelopment area beckons white people -- what with high-priced town houses and elevator apartments
The Capitol Hill rehabilitation like Foggy Bottom replaces Negroes with whites but also replaces some whites with other whites
The sharpest break with tradition the past and present of `` White Ring Around a Black Core `` may come with the opening of nearby Montgomery County suburbs to Negro residents and presumably the consequent conclusion of some whites that they can not escape the Negro by fleeing to the suburbs
In fact short of fleeing to Warrenton Virginia or Rockville Maryland white people may have to live with Negroes
All of this must be taken into account before the image of an `` all-Negro `` D.C. public school system is conjured up
Problems to solve
From the Summary Report before us at this Conference a number of problems are apparent
They vex us and perplex us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems
First how can we step up the desegregation movement
It is slow
I believe we all want more schools where white and Negro together can and do attend
I believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color
In general members of NAIRO would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone
How to achieve this objective is a problem but we are not divided on what we want
Second as we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves how can we achieve this action through school board action
It may be county school board or state school board action as well as that of municipal school boards
Correlatively can we reduce the role of the district courts so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court
This is a problem and I believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation
Third how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools
Not simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but a continuing program that also promotes integration that encourages the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro but as human beings
Again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education
not whether it should be done
Fourth in the segregated school system during the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity
In fact in the desegregated school system which may have a good many schools with all-Negro population how can we assure equal opportunity
This is a problem but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence
Fifth in the segregated school system or in the all-Negro or all-white schools how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group
Can we help children adjust to `` images of other children `` when the latter are not actually present
Now the issues
If we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion then there are twice as many issues which I judge sharply divide us intergroup relations practitioners and lay people
Issue no 1
Pupil assignment
Since on the one hand school desegregation has come in Virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment shall we support the plan
On the basis of pupil assignment criteria Judge Albert Bryan has assigned Negro children to formerly white schools in Arlington and Alexandria Virginia
Shall we support pupil assignment
On the other hand looking at the larger picture is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off blocked or reduced school desegregation to a `` trickle ``
Shall we therefore oppose the plan
This question is an issue because it likely divides us into two camps -- those for or against pupil assignment
Issue no 2
Teacher assignment in order to desegregate
In large cities like Baltimore Louisville and Washington D.C. should school desegregation be extended to all-Negro and all-white schools by assigning white and Negro teachers respectively
On the one hand do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race
Or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other school we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school -- namely to a teacher of another race
We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation
Issue no 3
The plaintiff in school desegregation cases
The earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation
In each instance the plaintiff was a private citizen
In thousands of school districts indeed in the entire State of Mississippi no plaintiff has come forth
And I have established that the action of municipal county or state school boards or boards of education is small infinitesimally small in comparison with the number of districts
Is the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement
Should Congress authorize the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance
Even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the Attorney General to act was eliminated should we nevertheless support such a clause
This is an issue for it divides people rather sharply
Issue no 4
Withholding of funds to schools that deny children on account of race
This is the Powell Amendment which in 1957 divided even a `` liberal `` group like the American Veterans Committee AVC
Should we support a clause in Federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny Federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a child on account of his race
This is softer than earlier Powell amendments which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts
There is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause softened though it be on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools
The Federal funds limitation enlists the support of many the opposition of quite a few
Issue no 5
Required public education
Should a political subdivision state or county or municipality be required to furnish public education
For the school year 1959-1960 the Prince Edward County Virginia Board of Supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education and the school board therefore could provide no public education -- for white or Negro children
Is public education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education
Or is this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of states rights or county rights
If people do n't want to provide public education should they be forced to do so
Even if we marshal substantial agreement behind mandatory public education we likely can not expect that all the states will enact the legislation
Should the requirement which must therefore be Federal in nature be legislated by the United States Congress
Or must it become law by amendment of the United States Constitution
We actually have two issues in this question -- goal and method
Issue no 6
Federal responsibility for education of the citizens
If the above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens Issue No 6 may be moot
If on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being debated and resolved does the Federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in Prince Edward County
Nearly half the children still receive no education
Must or should the Federal government help
Should the government directly provide education for the children who want public education
The next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers
On the whole it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way
Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn
A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth
In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education
Campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence `` as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues
The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of educational policy
In general it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society
There have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy
If there were more such cases it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes
There is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged
This is the issue of segregated schools in the South
In this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups
Thus the white middle and lower classes are arrayed against the Negro middle and lower classes
This conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people
If this happens there may be some class conflict in the South with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position
The educational profession
The members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position being strongest in the universities
They are mostly upper-middle- and lower-middle-class people with a few in the upper class
Do they make class-biased decisions
In a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens these social values it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society
There is no problem here
The problem arises if it does arise when the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence but which bears some relation to the social structure
For instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college scholarship does he consciously or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class
Again in deciding on the content and method of his teaching does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the race for higher economic status or does he favor a curriculum which strengthens students in other ways
The answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator 's own social-class position and also upon his social history as well as upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator
In a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class backgrounds Wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the teacher 's personality as well as on his social-class background
One upward-mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment
One social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families
Their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers
While this influence is a complex matter depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth
Teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them
that is they are likely to favor a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value
This does not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education as contrasted with liberal education but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement value as against a kind of `` pure `` liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs
There is no doubt that higher education since World War 2 has moved away from `` pure `` liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and specialization
There are several causes for this one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training
But another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social advancement
Compared with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of immigrants and more children of urban working-class fathers
Their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born parents who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum
The `` public interest `` groups
Educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in the public interest
Legislators are one such group and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation
They generally vote so as to serve their own constituency and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education
However there are relatively few such political constituencies and as has been pointed out there is seldom a clear-cut distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another
Another public interest group is the commission of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations
Generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society as they conceive it
Nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations can not please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view
For instance there have been two Presidential Commissions on higher education since World War 2
President Truman 's Commission on Higher Education tended to take a liberal expansionist position while President Eisenhower 's Committee on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative
Both Commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people who attempted to act in the public interest
An example of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the Commission on the Financing of Higher Education sponsored by the Association of American Universities and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation
This Commission recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships
This might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by Byron S. Hollingshead entitled Who Should Go To College
Which recommended a federal government scholarship program
Furthermore the Commission set up the Council for Financial Aid to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education
Thus the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education
Then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs experiments and demonstrations
These people are practically always upper- or upper-middle-class persons who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society
Finally there are the parent organizations and the laymen 's organizations such as the National Association of Parents and Teachers and the Citizens Committee on Public Schools
These have an upper-middle-class leadership and a middle-class membership with rare exceptions where working-class parents are active in local P.-T.A matters
Like the other policy-making groups these are middle class in their educational attitudes and they attempt to act in the general public interest as they see it
In general it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole
They are predominantly middle- and upper-class people and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes
They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account
But there is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education
They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society
Attempts to influence social structure through education
Educational policy in the United States has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity
In so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more fluid artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced and people at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society
On the other hand there is a counterbalancing purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children
This leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification in the schools
Both of these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions
Maximizing economic and cultural opportunity
The broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting fluidity within the social structure
Fifty years ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an example of this movement
During the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities state colleges and community colleges
The reaffirmation of American faith in the comprehensive high school as expressed in the Conant study is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity
The recent federal government 's student-loan program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to lower-status youth
It is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records who were usually middle-class and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges
Meanwhile the private colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds
The gains in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions
Unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues
And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service
One such disagreement which will receive attention in this next chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must be made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs
Here the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma
Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis
The double-step type
Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs `` the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice
For more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types of analyses
By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution
The first or double-step type might also be called the `` railroad type `` because of its application to railroads and other transportation agencies by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission
The Cost Section distinguishes between directly variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter
The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run out-of-pocket costs `` -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist 's `` long-run marginal costs ``
There remains a residue of total costs or total `` revenue requirements `` which since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis
Nevertheless because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs it has apportioned this residue which it sometimes calls `` burden `` among the units of carload traffic on a basis partly ton partly ton-mile which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination
In recent years this burden which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic
has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet
Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs
Suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable
But in any event full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses namely that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service
and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination
The single-step type
We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which unlike the `` railroad type `` draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment the single-step type
It might be called the `` public utility `` type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases
Here no attempt is made first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs `` reasonably distributed `` residues of total costs
Instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables
Moreover whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission parlance `` variable cost `` means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost `` has been used more broadly so as to cover costs which while a function of some one variable such as output of energy or number of customers are not necessarily a linear function
As already noted in an earlier paragraph the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service such as residential commercial industrial power street lighting etc
This `` grand division `` permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class such as street lighting or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes
High-tension industrial power service for example would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension distribution lines
But the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all or nearly all classes of customers
and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates
The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis
But before turning to this example we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type
In the first subtype the analyst following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs including an allowance for `` cost of capital `` or `` fair rate of return `` among the different classes and units of service
Here an apportionment say of 5,000,000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers
But in the second subtype which I take to be the one more frequently applied only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital `` or `` fair return `` are apportioned directly among the various classes of service
To be sure the capital investments in or alternatively the estimated `` fair values `` of the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services
But any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a `` return `` realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service
Thus during any given year A if the revenues from the residential service are 7,000,000 B if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to 5,000,000 and C if the net investment in or value of the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to 30,000,000 the cost analyst will report that residential service in the aggregate has yielded a return of 2,000,000 or 6-2/3 per cent
Other services will show different rates of return some probably much lower and some higher
There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital `` from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital `` or `` fair rate of return ``
But the practice is likely to be misleading since it may seem to support a conclusion that as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment however low the rates of charge for this service are compensatory
Needless to say any such inference would be quite unwarranted
For the reason just suggested I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example
That is to say an allowance for `` cost of capital `` will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment
Three-part analysis of the costs of an electric utility business
In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant
Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc to residential commercial and industrial customers
This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions
Since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple
indeed that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption
In fact however the problem is not so simple
For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output or consumption of energy
A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required
The simplest division and the one most frequently used with subdivisions in gas and electric rate cases is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs `` `` energy `` or `` volumetric costs `` and `` demand `` or `` capacity `` costs
If this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does have in some rates there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service
For example the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a 1 customer charge a 5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours of energy at
per kilowatt-hour and a 2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of 1 per kilowatt -- a total bill of 8 for that month
But our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs
Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes
costs actually vary in much more complex ways
The customer costs
These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power consumption
Included as a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer
These minimum costs may come to 1 per month more or less for residential and small commercial customers although they are substantially higher for large industrial users who require more costly connections and metering devices
While costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates in the form of a mere `` service charge `` they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment
But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst 's frequent practice of including not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary low-voltage distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity
The preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist
Like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth
But what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models
Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science
It has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation
This push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word `` mass `` to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied
cf Rapoport 1959
Ch 11
Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent
The simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned
For if the small group notion involves the implicit claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic or subatomic proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such entities are valid
The mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation
cf Brodbeck 1959
Ch 12
A parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically formed
Philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories
This involves a sifting of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement
Merton 's functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different cultures yet it is perfectly clear as Nagel 1957
247 83 and Hempel 1959
271 307 indicate that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models in which the notions of teleology i.e metaphysical purpose are central
cf Chapter 9
Functionalism as a sociological credo is therefore not a direct consequence of observations but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment
The purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social science
It is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical
Such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its Platonic form as something soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences
But contrary to Whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for Plato
The uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism
However when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to dictate the conditions of empirical research it becomes formal metaphysics
shaping the contours of life to fit the needs of legends
The notion of philosophy as Queen Bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political ideology but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social sciences

Metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with nature as it was in antiquity
It has surrendered any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness as in Heidegger 's system 1929
Science is mocked for wishing to know nothing of Nothing in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of men
It is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality by distinguishing between description and prescription
It is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century
Consider the traditional `` four fields `` of philosophy logic ethics epistemology and esthetics
It is a commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological criteria they move away from philosophy as such
What is left to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect only the history of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by the canons of scientific method
In this situation philosophy has survived by separating itself from metaphysics by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions
The relinquishing by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sorts
In the new situation philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value
Beyond this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry but within its potential domain of relevance
In this connection it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were exploited
Likewise Kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by Laplace in his Systeme Du Monde
This does not mean that philosophy resolves the problems it generates any more so than Riemann 's geometry settled the physical status of the space-time continuum
But the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a monumental task
To those raised on Marcel 's Homo Viator and Heidegger 's das Nichtige this may seem a modest role for philosophy
However modesty and triviality are different qualities
Philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve
The ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a more durable sort of drama
By clarifying fundamental premises in the social sciences and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding
Philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed
The dissection of scientific theory the examination of a theory from the vantage-points of language epistemology and ethics is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less so because of its removal from empirical research
The realm of science whatever the degree of precision in formulations covers the range of prediction and explanation
cf Hempel and Oppenheim 1948

Whatever philosophy is conceived to be its rationalist logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science
For some forms of philosophy this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter
Bergson and Leroy announce that `` the secret is the center of a philosophy `` and thereafter a hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity
This is simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous
For as Merleau-Ponty indicated 1953 it is not the secret which is important but the removal of secrecy
In this philosophy and science share a common goal
The hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument
for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science
The mystification of metaphysical systems does not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical
The tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology
cf McGlynn 1958
Scientific systems and this includes even the relation of mechanist to relativist physics are built upon refined and corrected
Philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness are overthrown by rival systems
In addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics they differ in that science is essentially descriptive while philosophy in its inherited forms tends to be goal-oriented teleological and prescriptive
The threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject to objective analysis has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable than social behaviour
When dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas one has to become necessarily selective
Certain features we have touched upon philosophy as a logical deductive system from which a social science methodology can be built up
philosophic analysis of the assumptions and presumptions of the social sciences
and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigations
The objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in the social sciences
Specifically it will be asked whether the `` real `` questions people ask are not the `` ultimate `` questions that social science finds itself impotent in the face of
What then is the status of such questions as is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual goal
Do societies develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals
Does society really exist as an entity over and above the agglomeration of men
I think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical insistence these are questions so framed as to defy either empirical exploration or rational solutions
As Simmel 1908 and Dilthey 1922 indicated questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions but assertions of faith made to appear as legitimate questions
Such pseudo-questions assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals
Social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the wave-particle controversy
It is not that such questions are not asked
It is rather that introducing them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty
An operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or reshapes
To raise the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions having an irrational rather than scientific basis is in a real sense to undermine the objection itself
For what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational i.e for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and irrational
A philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence in the shortcomings of men an impatience with partial tentative solutions
Men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary
Uncertainty overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world
Without such uncertainty we are left with a set of dogmas and myths
The functional interplay of philosophy and science should as a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making
A degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition for the growth of science
But neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard
What were they to do then with these awkward judgments of value
To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery
It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only
If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all that they asserted nothing true or false but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah `` or `` Fiddlesticks `` then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest
This is the course the positivists took
They explained value judgments by explaining them away
Now I do not think their view will do
But before discussing it I should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case
It has been said of John Stuart Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out
This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind and this I will do my best to supply
The theory claims to show by analysis that when we say `` That is good `` we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking
I shall argue that we do mean to do just that
Let us work through an example and the simpler and commoner the better
There is perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad
Let us take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement
We come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use
There are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten off its own leg
The attempt failed the animal is now dead
As we think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered we are very likely to say `` It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so ``
The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion
I hold on the contrary that we mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it was bad -- bad when and as it occurred
Consider what follows from the positivist view
On that view nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came on the scene and made my remark
For what I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene
The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad
nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured
badness in the only sense in which it is involved at all waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt
Now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows
Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered
Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did
Clearly not
Indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not
If so then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only
We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it
The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference
It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this whereas on positivist grounds it should be
The second argument applies the method in the reverse way
It ideally removes the past event and shows that this would render false what we mean to say whereas on positivist grounds it should not
Let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all but that we mistakenly believe it did and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing
On the positivist theory everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second
In the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that feeling is still there
And our question is is such an implication consistent with what we meant
Clearly it is not
If anyone asked us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all we should say that it made all the difference in the world that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to be bad and that our assertion was in that case mistaken
The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering seems to me merely frivolous
If we did not mean to say this why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred
On the theory before us such relief would be groundless for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about
The positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition
So far as I can see there is only one way out for the positivist
He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval
And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself
The pain in itself was neutral
but unfortunately the rabbit on no grounds at all took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time and in the only intelligible sense bad
This way of escape is theoretically possible but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not so far as I know been urged by positivists it is perhaps best not to spend time over it
I come now to a third argument which again is very simple
When we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably make it with some feeling
the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling
But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again
And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded
The pathetic evidence is no longer before us
and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead
In these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark when first made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now expresses nothing
It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah `` would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it
And this seems to me untrue
When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before we should certainly answer Yes
We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time but that it was the same point we were making
And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express
I come now to a fourth consideration
We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not
but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense
Broad and Ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics and I suspect they are right
But that is not exactly my point
My point is this whether there is such fitness or not we all assume that there is and if we do we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do
Let me illustrate
In his novel The House Of The Dead Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison camp
Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today Dostoevsky 's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined
`` I have heard stories `` he writes `` of the most terrible the most unnatural actions of the most monstrous murders told with the most spontaneous childishly merry laughter ``
Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting
If we were asked why we thought so we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting
Now on the subjectivist view this answer is ruled out
For before someone takes up an attitude toward death suffering or their infliction they have no moral quality at all
There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting
They are in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral quality they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker
But if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any other
Would applause for example be fitting if apart from the applause there were nothing good to applaud
Would condemnation be fitting if independently of the condemnation there were nothing bad to condemn
In such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point
Indeed we are forced to go much farther
If goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line
If there is nothing evil in these things if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them why should n't they be greeted with a cheer
To greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad
it would needlessly bring badness into the world
and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright
On the other hand to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good
it would bring goodness into the world
The injured German veteran was a former miner twenty-four years old who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head
This resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also
In any event the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind `` while at the same time apparently the sense of touch remained essentially intact
Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence
This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that when the patient closed his eyes he had absolutely no spatial that is third-dimensional awareness whatsoever
The necessary inference as the authors themselves interpret it would seem to be this `` 1 Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch as such
We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself
2 Spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations
that is there is in the true sense only a visual space ``
The underlying assumption of course is that only sight and touch enable us in any precise and fully dependable way to locate objects in space beyond us the other senses being decidedly inferior if not totally inadequate in this regard
This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel
Therefore if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself can not focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary
The force of the authors analysis if indeed it has any force can be felt by the reader I believe only after three questions have been successfully answered
1 What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed
2 What evidence is there that he was psychically blind
3 How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury
We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation
Obviously a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative if the argument is to get under way at all for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient 's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course as evidence to establish the desired conclusion
The answer the authors give to it therefore is of supreme importance
It is as follows `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness pressure pain temperature as well as the kinesthetic sensations muscular feelings feelings in the tendons and joints were as such essentially intact although they seemed in comparison with normal reactions to be somewhat diminished over the entire body
The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as the direction and scope of a movement passively executed with one of his members proved to have been on the contrary very considerably affected ``
The authors insist however that these abnormalities in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight
First of all what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged
1 When an object was placed in the patient 's hand he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold sharp or blunt rough or smooth flexible soft or hard
and he could tell simply by the feel of it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on
And he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had handled immediately before even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him
that is he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was
2 The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade
Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight the patient had to train himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio-maker an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour
It seems clear when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision
And so the authors conclude `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work even more than the foregoing facts mentioned above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was unaffected
or to put the same thing in physiological terms that the performance-capacity of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain -- that is from one end to the other -- was unimpaired ``
If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective visual condition
But before we can do this we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2
then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand
In what ways then did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself
He could not see objects as unified self-contained and organized figures as a person does with normal vision
The meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects
and therefore he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again
Instead he constantly became lost in parts and components of them confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects and so on unless he allowed time to `` trace `` the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours
According to his own testimony he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots `` of color of a more or less indefinite size
at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether
But by the tracing procedure he could in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form
could piece as it were the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned out to be
If however the figure to be discerned were complicated composed of several interlocking subfigures and so on even the tracing process failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts
This meant concretely that the patient could not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or body became easily confused by `` hasher marks `` inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it
The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all
and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him
After a conversation with another man he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like
Nor could he call up memory-pictures of close friends or relatives
In short both his own declarations and his figural blindness when he looked at objects seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all
He was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learned and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do
He could not recognize it
he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all
Therefore his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object
and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure
Then he might finally recognize it apparently by combining the visual blot actually being seen with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements
This would mean it can readily be seen that again for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery
As one would surmise the procedure however could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference
Men trees automobiles houses and so on -- objects continually confronted in everyday life -- had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable at the very beginning of tracing by an inference as to what each was
Dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface
He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects but their size and the dots gave them away
And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it
Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly without the tracing motions solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared in his visual experience
Perhaps the very important question -- What is then exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient 's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things
-- has now been raised in the reader 's mind and in the following form
If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he can not perceive it visually then it would seem the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations at least in regard to two dimensions and as we shall see even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors
How then do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this
The authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability tactually 1 to perceive figure and 2 to locate objects in space with his eyes closed or turned away from the object concerned
Quite naturally they make the investigation first by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and then later by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to
When the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all the following striking results occurred
Whenever artists indeed turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures which were rare down to 800 B.C they tended to reflect reality see Plate 6a 9b
a schematic abstract treatment of men and animals by intent rose only in the late eighth century
To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment
At the least however one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order
their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line
Their world again was a still simple traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life
And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure
The storms of the past had died away and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds
Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm severe serenity displays itself
In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world
The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future `` and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated
The Aegean in 800 B.C
Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough detailed study which it deserves partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations as at Argos are only now coming to light
From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects however the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C
The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree
Much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800
In this process the Minoan-Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected
the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800
Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct
but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium
The focus of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean always excepting its northern shores had accepted the Geometric style of pottery
While Protogeometric vases usually turn up especially outside Greece proper together with as many or more examples of local stamp these `` non-Greek `` patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century
In their place came local variations within the common style -- tentative as it were in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed
Attica though important was not the only teacher of this age
One can take a vase of about 800 B.C and without any knowledge of its place of origin venture to assign it to a specific area
imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable
The potters of the Aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland and in Greece itself Argive Corinthian Attic Boeotian and other Geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks
These local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half
The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages from linguistic distribution and from the survivals of early social political and religious patterns into later ages
By 800 B.C the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture
On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad
Everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local diversity
Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized and plagued by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors
Further we can not go for the Dark ages deserve their name
Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure
The epic poems the consolidation of the Greek pantheon the rise of firm political units the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men -- all these had to await the progress of following decades
What we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and yet the results however general are worth the search
These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook independent of outside forces
To interpret indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information
if we could see more deeply we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period
The historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding
Throughout the Dark ages it is clear the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently
The pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood on firm ground
Chapter 5 the early eighth century
the landscape of Greek history broadens widely and rather abruptly in the eighth century B.C the age of Homer 's `` rosy-fingered Dawn ``
The first slanting rays of the new day can not yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world
but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change
For this period as for earlier centuries pottery remains the most secure source
the ceramic material of the age is more abundant more diversified and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers who begin to show scenes of human life and death
Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece
objects in gold ivory and bronze grow more numerous
Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful
Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750
The Dipylon Geometric pottery of Athens and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek civilization
but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending
Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth
The revolution was well under way before 700 B.C and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century
The era however is Janus-faced
While many tokens point forward the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the Dark ages
The dominant pottery of the century was Geometric
political organization revolved about the basileis
trade was just beginning to expand
the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress
The modern student who knows what was to come next is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century
Not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis
Many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas
the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized
Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization
On this principle of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture society and politics
for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself
The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750
We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery the epic and the myth and the religious evolution of early Greece
the important point however is that these magnificent achievements unlike those of later decades were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models
The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past
the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe Geometric
The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery
but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance
The vases which resulted had different shapes far more complex decoration and a larger sense of style
Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines
In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos
They had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses
The potters in particular had virtually eschewed freehand drawing elaborate motifs and the curving lines of nature while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe
In their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization at first hesitantly in Protogeometric work and then more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric style
By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved at least on a simple plane
it was time to take bigger steps to venture on experiments
Ripe Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited
In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress
To the ancestral lore however new materials were added
Painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color
instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep
Wavy lines feather-like patterns rosettes of indefinitely floral nature birds either singly or in stylized rows animals in solemn frieze bands see Plates 11 12 -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze
The rows of animals and birds in particular suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek
Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not yet been precisely determined it seems to appear first in the Cyclades which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century
As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased the local variations within a common style became more evident
Plate 12 illustrates four examples which are Ripe or Late Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools
Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and when he could not show the hide arrested him
Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction he later released him
Even while suffering the trip to his home Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian
Three weeks later following his recovery armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez
Arriving at daybreak they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender
Instead he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him Cook reported
Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing but the company officers felt that in the end it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion
General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away and try to have a few punished
On February 17 Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased
While talking with Julian M. Beall Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared both heavily armed and after watching the house for a while rode away
It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream
They had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them
Suspecting an ambush the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill
After spending two nights Wednesday and Thursday in Catskill the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business
They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett Lee ranch
Half a mile below at the mouth of Salyer 's Canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A. J. Armstrong occupied by a Mexican his wife and an old trapper
There were three houses in Salyer 's Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff the road winding along the top entering above and then passing down in front of the houses thence to the Vermejo
To the west of this road was another low bluff forty or fifty feet high covered with scrub oak and other brush
As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers
Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush but one hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm passing on through his body
With the first reports Russell 's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook followed by a hail of bullets raced towards the arroyo of Salyer 's Canyon immediately in front of him just reaching it as his horse fell
Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank
Bullets were so thick throwing sand in his face that he found it difficult to return the fire
Noticing Russell 's horse in front of the long log building he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight so he began working his way down the ditch to join him
At a very shallow place two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot
Dropping to one knee Cook felled one and the other struggled off with his comrade sending no further fire in his direction
Just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed he did hear shots down at the house
Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised dismounted but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him he fell into the trapper 's arms -- dead
A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head tearing a hole two-inches square on the outgoing side
Finding him dead Cook caught Russell 's horse and rode to the cattle foreman 's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins
Before daylight Sunday morning a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco Chaves where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered
MacPherson boldly approached the fortified adobe house and demanded entrance
The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid
The officer demanded the names of the injured men
the Mexicans not only refused to give them but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it
Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated too small a posse had been collected and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw
The posse 's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent
During the following week six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned
some buildings farm tools two horses plows and hay owned by Bonito Lavato a friendly interpreter for the company and Pedro Chavez hay were stolen or destroyed
and a store was broken into and robbed
District Attorney M. W. Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms -- he just did n't catch anyone
Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico
His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense perpetuating the troubles
By early summer he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad way financially so Pels sent him a draft for 100 warning that it was still not wise for him to return
Pels also sent a check for 100 to Russell 's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave
Cattle stealing and killing again serious during the spring of 1891 placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing position
They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot
And the law virtually ignored the situation
The judge became ill just as the Colfax District Court convened no substitute was brought in no criminal cases heard only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks
Pels complained `` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business
public money spent
justice delayed
nothing accomplished and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce ``
Word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was Manuel Gonzales a man with many followers including a number who were kept in line through fear of him
Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named Asher Jones the warrant for his arrest had never been served
On May 19 a deputy sheriff 's posse of eight men left Maxwell City and rode thirty-five miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan Jose Martinez
By 3:00 A.M. they reached his house and found it vacant
When they were refused entrance to his brother 's house nearby they smashed down the door broke the window and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room
Still there was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing
About 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square
While prowling around these buildings two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside
He was promised that no harm would befall him if he would come out but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door
The posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive
Again he refused
In deadly earnest the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor
When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside square against the muzzle of a Winchester
Shot near the heart he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away three bullets following him
As he pushed open the door he fell on his face one of his comrades pulling him inside
Not realizing the seriousness of the wound the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him
Receiving no answer they set the fire
When the house was about half consumed his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel
Finding it true that he was not inside the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket
Several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand
Shot six or eight times the body was draped with Russell 's pistol belt and cartridges
There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who though numbering in the fifties had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack
Early the next morning a Mexican telephoned Pels that Celso Chavez one of the posse members was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father 's home on the upper Vermejo
The sheriff and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed according to signed statements by Chavez and Dr I. P. George and ordered Deputy Barney Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman
Traveling all night Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22
Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills disappearing at the posse 's approach
A Mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against Chavez for taking part in the `` murder `` of Manuel Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger
The men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along with three other families desiring to leave
The ten or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large and Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe houses defending themselves through loopholes it would be most difficult to capture them
Thus he wired J. P. Lower and Sons of Denver `` Have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot
If not how long to order and what is the price ``
He wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard
His problem then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean out the Vermejo by force immediately
The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant
The Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality and assessments were made for its maintenance
It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill
Fire District No 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 but considered it an unwise investment
The sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street
As new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it
B. J. Connell is the present treasurer and manager
The 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center Depot and Way 's Lane
The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report
The layout of the sewer lines was designed by Henry W. Taylor who was the engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant
No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town
The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities
The final step was a vote for a 230,000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by the 1959 town meeting later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town meeting June 21 1960
There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams
Telephone and telegraph
Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev J. D. Wickham headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor Samuel F. B. Morse
At any rate Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington
In 1846 Matthew B. Goodwin jeweler and watchmaker became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox House `` or `` one door north of the Bank Manchester Vermont ``
Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American Telegraph Company `` and the `` Troy and Canada Junction Telegraph Company ``
Shares of capital stock at 15 each in the latter company were payable at the Bank of Manchester or at various other Vermont banks
A message of less than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents
By 1871 L. C. Orvis manager of the `` Western Union Telegraph Company `` expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore
Orvis even needed to hire an assistant Clark J Wait
The Manchester Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business
In the fall of 1878 the `` Popular Telegraph Line `` was established between Manchester and Factory Point by the owners Paul W. Orvis Henry Gray J. N. Hard and Clark J Wait
The line soon lived up to its name as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock
In 1879 the same Clark Wait with H. H. Holley of South Dorset formed the `` American Telegraph Line `` extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and South Dorset to Dorset
Besides being most convenient the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners ``
Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron C. Burr and Mark Manley of `` Burr and Manley `` dealers in lumber and dry goods
Early equipment was very flimsy
the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles making communications impossible
But companies continued to spring up
By 1883 the `` Battenkill Telegraph Company `` was in existence and Alvin Pettibone was its president
Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley Telegraph Line `` officers of which were E. C. Orvis president
H. K. Fowler vice-president and secretary
J. N. Hard treasurer
F. H. Walker superintendent
H. S. Walker assistant superintendent
Two companies now had headquarters with Clark J Wait who by then had his own drugstore at Factory Point -- the `` Northern Union Telegraph Company `` and the `` Western Union ``
Operators were Arthur Koop and Norman Taylor
Still existing on a `` Northern Union `` telegraph form is a typical peremptory message from Peru grocer J. J. Hapgood to Burton and Graves store in Manchester -- `` Get and send by stage four pounds best Porterhouse or serloin stake for Mrs. Hapgood send six sweet oranges ``
About 1888 J. E. McNaughton of Barnumville and E. G. Bacon became proprietors of the `` Green Mountain Telegraph Company `` connecting all offices on the Western Union line and extending over the mountain from Barnumville to Peru Londonderry South Londonderry Lowell Lake Windham North Windham Grafton Cambridgeport Saxton 's River and Bellows Falls
From 1896 until 1910 John H. Whipple was manager of Western Union at the Center in the drugstore he purchased from Clark Wait
The Village office of Western Union with George Towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in Hard 's drugstore until 1905
During the summers Towsley often needed the assistance of a company operator
These were the years when people flocked to Manchester not only to play golf which had come into vogue but also to witness the Ekwanok Country Club tournaments
New Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers
This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the free advertising
In 1914 when the town was chosen for the U. S. Amateur Golf tournament a representative hurried here from the Boston manager 's office
In his wake came the District Traffic Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession ten of Boston 's best chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf
During that tournament alone some 250,000 words winged their way out of Manchester
The old Morse system was replaced locally by the Simplex modern automatic method in 1929 when Ellamae Heckman Wilcox was manager of the Western Union office
During summers business was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox had two assistants and a messenger
She was succeeded by Clarence Goyette
Since that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town clerk 's office and drugstore at the Village
After being located for some years in the Village at the Equinox Pharmacy under the supervision of Mrs. Harry Mercier it is presently located in the Hill and Dale Shop Manchester Center
The first known telephone line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and Manley 's store at Manchester Depot and the Kent and Root Marble Company in South Dorset
This was extended the following year to include the railroad station agent 's office and Thayer 's Hotel at Factory Point
In November 1887 a line connecting several dwelling houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester Depot
Telephone wires from Louis Dufresne 's house in East Manchester to the Dufresne lumber job near Bourn Pond were up about 1895
Eber L. Taylor of Manchester Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East Dorset and Barnumville in his diary for 1906
These must have been for local calls strictly as in May 1900 the `` only long distance telephone `` in town was transferred from C. B. Carleton 's to Young 's shoe store
A small single switchboard was installed in the Village over Woodcock 's hardware store later E. H. Hemenway 's
George Woodcock was manager and troubleshooter
Elizabeth Way was the first operator
and a night operator was also employed
Anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the Manchester Journal
In 1918 the New England Telephone Company began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of U. S. Rte 7 and what is now Memorial Avenue at Manchester Center
Service running through Barnumville and to Bennington County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the `` Gleason Telephone Company `` in 1925 but major supervision of telephone lines in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company which eventually gained all control
More aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business
In 1931 Mrs. F. H. Briggs agent and chief operator who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years service led agency offices in sales for the year with 2,490
William Hitchcock who retired in 1938 was a veteran of thirty-four years local service
Another veteran telephone operator was Edith Fleming Blackmer who had been in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960
In 1932 Dorset received its own exchange which made business easier for the Manchester office but it was not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester and Dorset
This eliminated toll calls between the two towns
Within a month calls were up seventy per cent
electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use
Yet one has to go back only some sixty years
The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben Colvin 's and Houghton 's gristmill on the West Branch in Factory Point
No records are available as to the date or extent of installation but it may have been in 1896
On June 14 1900 the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for Edward S. Isham at `` Ormsby Hill ``
This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service
In November 1900 surveying was done under John Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant
Nothing came of it perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage
The next step was construction by the Manchester Light and Power Company of a plant on the west bank of the Battenkill south of Union Street bridge
This was nearly completed May 23 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10 but the first light did not go on until September 28
It was at the end of the sidewalk in front of the Dellwood Cemetery cottage
The first directors of the Manchester Light and Power Company were John Marsden M. L. Manley William F. Orvis George Smith and John Blackmer
The officers were John Marsden president
John C. Blackmer vice-president
George Smith treasurer
and William F. Orvis secretary
Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company the Colonial Light and Power Company for one year
At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way the Vail Light and Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity
Manchester then had two competing power companies until 1904 when the Manchester Light and Power Company purchased the transmission system of the Vail Company
This was fortunate as the Vail plant burned in 1905
The Colonial Light and Power Company was succeeded by the Vermont Hydro-Electric Corporation which in turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation
The latter now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at Manchester Depot which was put into operation February 19 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger transformers
For a time following the abandonment of the local plant electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the Vermont Marble Company system to the north
Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world `` `` a phantasy with which More amused himself `` `` a holiday work a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention ``
With respect to this view two points are worth making
First it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus `` `` gay ``
It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus `` `` no less salutary than gay ``
It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon and quite clearly in More 's lexicon the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn
More believed that a man could be both serious and gay
That a writer who is gay can not be serious is a common professional illusion sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of
Secondly to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself
Indeed it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History who fathered this most peculiar view and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent
But to return to the main line of our inquiry it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr
Utopia is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity
And if he did stand on the margins of modernity it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom
It was not even in writing Latin epigrams sometimes bawdy ones or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New Testament
Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century
Had More 's writings been wholly limited to such exercises they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works
More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia
And the evidence that he does indeed stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so
Only one other contemporary of More 's evokes so immediate and direct a response and only one other contemporary work -- Niccolo Machiavelli and The Prince
Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response
Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there
we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval the Renaissance and the modern
The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More the author of Utopia in some intelligible relation with St. Thomas More the martyr
To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian Humanism the Renaissance elements are of primary concern
But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation
we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has
we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia
What is new about it
To that question the answer is simple
it can be made in two words Utopian communism
But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials
Surely there is nothing new about communism
We find it in Plato 's Republic and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book
We find it in that `` common way of life pleasing to Christ and still in use among the truest societies of Christians `` that is the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity
We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions
This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle Ages
and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it
But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 it is not communism as such that we are concerned with
We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus Platonic Stoic early Christian monastic canonist or theological communism
we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia as More conceived it
Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory
We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not
In Plato 's Republic communism is -- to speak anachronistically -- a communism of Janissaries
Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among whom private ownership prevails the governing warrior elite
Moreover it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato 's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods wives and children was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche
and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns
In More 's Utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass
Utopian communism applies to all Utopians
And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central
The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu the best ordering of a civil society
and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering
To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit the monastic communities is with an appropriate shift of adjectives misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato 's Republic in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes
The apostolic community was literally an elite chosen by Christ himself
And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors their spiritual athleticism
Finally the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More 's time although it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the Middle Ages
In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man
It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned
The actual function of patristic communism was adequately set forth by St. Gregory almost a millenium before More wrote Utopia
`` The soil is common to all men
When we give the necessities of life to the poor we restore to them what is already theirs
We should think of it more as an act of justice than compassion ``
Because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his
Indeed of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian
He is a trustee for the common good however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund wisely or unwisely entrusted to his keeping
In contrast to this Stoic-patristic view Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve
The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions
In a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still
In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role
Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced
We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks
In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it Utopian communism remains as an integral whole original -- a new thing
It is not merely a new thing
it is one of the very few new things in Utopia
most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism
But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern
and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia when Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man
New indeed is Luther 's perception but not modern as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at
Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern it is not modern communism or even modern socialism as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice
Consider the features of Utopian communism generous public provision for the infirm
democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests meals taken publicly in common refectories
a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens
even houses changed once a decade
six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking
no private property no money
no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term
Whatever the merits of its intent Utopian communism is far too naive far too crude to suit any modern socialist or communist
It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern it is the spirit the attitude of mind that informs those details
What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late Antiquity
During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence
During the Brown trial however the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper the Providence Daily Post stated that Brown was a murderer a man of blood and that he and his associates with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments
The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states ``
The two major newspapers in Providence continued throughout the crisis to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history
While the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men
Editor Foss stated `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial and a fair trial ``
The Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings
The Providence Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace
On October 31 1859 John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia inciting slave rebellion and murder
For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday December 2 1859
Upon receiving the news Northern writers editors and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states particularly Virginia
Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections they watched John Brown 's trial with extreme interest
On Wednesday morning November 2 1859 the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty no man however criminal ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial
The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted
The readers of the Providence Daily Post however learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old Brown `` had a fair trial
Concerning the sentence the editor asked `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws organized treason and butchered her citizens ``
In the eastern section of the state the newspapers reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical
J. Wheaton Smith editor of the Warren Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied a solitary example must be set in order that all those misnamed philantropists who actuated by a blind zeal dare to instigate riot treason and murder may heed it and shape their future course accordingly ``
The editor of the Newport Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital punishment
In direct contrast to the other Rhode Island editors Samuel S. Foss of the Woonsocket Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair
Concerning the sentence Foss wrote `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment it would be well -- well for the country and for Virginia ``
Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown Rhode Islanders turned their attention to the state elections
The state had elected Republican candidates in the past two years
There was no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state
If it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by majorities the failure was due to a lingering remnant of the Know-Nothing party which called itself the American Republican party
The American Republicans and the Republicans both nominated Lieutenant-Governor Turner for governor
Elisha R. Potter was the Democratic candidate
The results of the election of 1859 found Republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two Congressional offices from the eastern and western sections of the state
During the month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers
On November 7 1859 the Providence Daily Journal reprinted a letter sent to John Brown from `` E. B. `` a Quaker lady in Newport
In reference to Brown 's raid she wrote `` though we are non-resistants and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons we know thee was anemated by the most generous and philanthropic motives ``
`` E. B. `` compared John Brown to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression
In contrast to `` E. B. `` most Rhode Islanders hardly thought of John Brown as being another Moses
Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in Rhode Island
On Wednesday evening November 23 1859 in Warren Rev Mark Trafton of New Bedford gave a `` Mission of Sympathy `` lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper 's Ferry insurrection
The Warren Telegraph stated that many of Rev Trafton 's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism
In its account of the Trafton lecture the Providence Daily Post said that the remarks of Rev Trafton made the people indignant
No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy
The Providence Daily Journal however stated that Brown 's courage bravery and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr
it gives something of dignity even to a bad one ``
The Woonsocket Patriot admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A Wise or James Buchanan ``
The Newport Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him
In her letter to John Brown `` E. B. `` the Quakeress from Newport had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington
During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in `` E B 's `` suggestion
On November 22 1859 the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck `` and honest fanaticism must be admired any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions
A week later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution
The editor of the Daily Journal warned `` that if such a demonstration be made it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence ``
The Providence Daily Post 's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence
He further called upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace
On December 2 1859 John Brown was hanged at Charles Town Virginia
Extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold
In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled
Such was not the case in Rhode Island
The only public demonstration in honor of John Brown was held at Pratt 's Hall in Providence on the day of his execution
Despite the opposition of the city newspapers the Pratt Hall meeting `` brought together a very respectable audience composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery of many of our colored citizens and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering ``
Seated on the platform were Amos C. Barstow ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer
Thomas Davis an uncompromising Garrisonian
the Reverend Augustus Woodbury a Unitarian minister
the Reverend George T. Day a Free-Will Baptist
Daniel W. Vaughan and William H. H. Clements
The latter two were appointed secretaries
The first speaker was Amos C. Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting
He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John Brown of Harper 's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island 's colonial period
Barstow concluded that as Rhode Island 's John Brown became a canonized hero if not a saint so would it be with John Brown of Harper 's Ferry
The next speaker was George T. Day
Although admitting Brown 's guilt on legal grounds Day said that `` Brown is no common criminal
his deed was not below but above the law ``
Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of Brown 's attempt at servile insurrection his admiration of Brown 's character and his opposition to slavery
Woodbury 's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing
The fourth and last speaker was Thomas Davis
By this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall
Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city
He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments
In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned ``
He recalled that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man Thomas W. Dorr proclaimed the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty
At the close of Davis speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously
Whereas John Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper Therefore
Resolved that while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor
Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice
Resolved that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action
Resolved that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper 's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible
On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes it could have been avoided completely
Rather than being deceived the eye is puzzled
instead of seeing objects in space it sees nothing more than -- a picture
Through 1911 and 1912 as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances
To reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulated typography Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint
the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas
In certain other pictures however Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing
These areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective
that is by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface
The accumulation of such devices however soon had the effect of telescoping even while separating surface and depth
The process of flattening seemed inexorable and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion
It was for this reason and no other that I can see that in September 1912 Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint
Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas
It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's which would confirm the date he assigns it
But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography
and moreover he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910
When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each
It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked out in oil
By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done
But here again the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim
For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief which gives way in turn and with equal immediacy to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither
Because of the size of the areas it covers the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily as more than an indication or sign
Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture and the device boomerangs the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before
Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture
The actual surface becomes both ground and background and it turns out -- suddenly and paradoxically -- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of upon the surface
In their very first collages Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real bas-relief space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in or flat upon the surface
And the surface is driven back in its very surfaceness only by this contrast
In the upper center of Braque 's first collage Fruit Dish in Douglas Cooper 's collection a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane
The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it
Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump ``
At the same time the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them and by their placing in relation to the block capitals
and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining
Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane
and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface
And the same thing more or less can be said of the contents of Picasso 's first collage
In later collages of both masters a variety of extraneous materials are used sometimes in the same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of
The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a painted-in form -- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface while something will be drawn painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth
Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially
All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it
Flatness may now monopolize everything but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not properly speaking a pictorial illusion
Depicted Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal undepicted kind but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind -- and it does so moreover without depriving the latter of its literalness
rather it underpins and reinforces that literalness re-creates it
Out of this re-created literalness the Cubist subject reemerged
For it had turned out by a further paradox of Cubism that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging
In the Analytical phase of their Cubism Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it
they had also had to generalize it -- to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself
In order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated
and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method the subject itself became largely unrecognizable
Cubism in its 1911-1912 phase which the French with justice call `` hermetic `` was on the verge of abstract art
It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma they had to choose between illusion and representation
If they opted for illusion it could only be illusion per se -- an illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects
If on the other hand they opted for representation it had to be representation per se -- representation as image pure and simple without connotations at least without more than schematic ones of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed
It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become for the first time mutually exclusive alternatives
In the end Picasso and Braque plumped for the representational and it would seem they did so deliberately
This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality ``
But the inner formal logic of Cubism as it worked itself out through the collage had just as much to do with shaping their decision
When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage they had to coalesce -- become `` synthesized `` -- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane
Left in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly into depth
and the broad opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane
Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat they also assert themselves as silhouettes
and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts if it does start from a subject
It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects or at least parts of them re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913
Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage but not conclusively
nor did Synthetic Cubism fully begin there
Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil and transformed by this translation did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to if not the illusion of unmistakable three-dimensional identities
Synthetic Cubism began with Picasso alone late in 1913 or early in 1914
this was the point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque never again to relinquish it
But even before that Picasso had glimpsed and entered for a moment a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him
It was as though in that instant he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal three-dimensionality
This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage and of Cubism in general literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane
Some time in 1912 Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar
to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane
The affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief
Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper
And without high density in the core rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically let alone built from scratch at today 's prices
However the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever
The new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways including the grade-constructed accesses occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York
It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use `` of centrally located urban land
As it affects the city 's fiscal situation such an interchange is ruinous
it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services
Subways improved land values without taking away land
freeways boost valuation less because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot and reduce the acreage that can be taxed
Downtown Los Angeles is already two-thirds freeway interchange street parking lot and garage -- one of those preposterous `` if `` statistics has already come to pass
The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an artificial isolating boundary
City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might
Less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful -- especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the ramp
Meanwhile the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance
In ever greater numbers factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial parks `` removed from the city 's political jurisdiction
The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor
To light industry the economies of being on one floor are much slighter but efficiency engineers usually believe in them and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs can not be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers
This movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe
It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities
The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities -- the rubber factories in Akron Chrysler 's Detroit plants U.S. Steel 's Pittsburgh works -- often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city yet close to transport river storage piers and power river
The `` leapfrog `` was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet blighted
The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site
Until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes
The railroad siding is still important -- it is usually though not always true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking
But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days and many businesses can live without the railroad
And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory
Willow Run General Electric 's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse the Pentagon Boeing in Seattle Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles the new automobile assembly plants everywhere -- none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit
They are all suburban plants relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers
And wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry
The drive along Massachusetts Route 128 the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston may be a vision of the future
The future could be worse
The plants along Route 128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks and trees
They can even be rather grand like Edward Land 's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid
But they deny the values of the city -- the crowded competitive tolerant city the `` melting pot `` which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities
They are segregated businesses combining again on one site the factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated communities
It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts Route 128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements or from the exploitation of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly
While the factories were always the center of the labor market they were often on the city 's periphery
In spreading the factories even farther the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities
Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has been relatively painless
the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every year
What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing especially in those cities where public transit is feeble
Some retailing of course always spreads with the population -- grocery stores drugstores local haberdasheries and dress shops candy stores and the like
But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago -- a new bedroom set or a winter coat an Easter bonnet a bicycle for Junior -- the family set off for the downtown department store where the selection would be greatest
Department stores congregated in the `` one hundred per cent location `` where all the transit lines converged
These stores are still there but the volume of the `` downtown store `` has been on a relative decline while in many cities the suburban `` branch `` sells more and more dry goods
If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing however his dollar volume continues to rise and it is dollars which you put in the bank
In most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are substantially inflated
No suburban shopping-center branch -- not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store
Telephone orders distort the picture the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax
The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened
Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are
In many cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches `` -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store
Fear of the competition -- always a great motivating force in the American economy -- makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches
The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches
Moreover the cost of operations is always high in any new store as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover
When all has been said however the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing
Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store though both are the same distance from home
Indeed there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown
Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St. Louis have been driving across the Mississippi through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town
To the extent that the problem is merely parking an aggressive downtown management like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus Ohio can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door
If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems however the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program
And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people `` rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store the central location may be in serious trouble
Today according to land economist Homer Hoyt shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres of land which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation 's Central Business Districts put together
The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety both within its gates and across the street where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind
If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing taking the kid downtown is too much of a production household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items
Department stores were built on dry goods especially ladies fashions and in this area in the long run the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown
If this analysis is correct the suburban branches will turn out to be what management 's cost accountants refuse to acknowledge marginal operations rather than major factors
Historically in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life the variety of experience they offered
`` How ya gon na keep 'em down on the farm ``
Was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree
Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown
Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference -- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians is actually upon us
Suburbs and Negroes
In their book American Skyline Christopher Tunnard and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility -- a fine ironical argument when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote
The first superhighways -- New York 's Henry Hudson and Chicago 's Lake Shore San Francisco 's Bay Bridge and its approaches a good slice of the Pennsylvania Turnpike -- were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression
At the same time Roosevelt 's Federal Housing Administration coupled with Henry Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes
Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U. S. government
householders who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent under government aegis
Before losing itself in the sands of the 19th Century the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington
The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find
But it is a great conception
The open ceiling with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky the closed frieze formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers
The descent may be remote but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States
Constantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure
After many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door and ending with William Penn all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career
He left at his death sketches drawn to scale for the rest of the circle
These were carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania and noting in pencil in Italian that he `` began at this point ``
When Costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six feet of empty frieze were left over
A blank undecorated void plastered in roughcast disfigured the wall of the Rotunda until 1951
Then advised by the Architect of the Capitol the Joint Committee for the Library traditionally responsible for the works of art in the building ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco to show `` the Peace after the Civil War `` `` the Spanish-American War `` and `` the Birth of Aviation `` to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi 's technique and composition
Later the cleaning and restoration were ordered first of the older part of the frieze finally of the canopy
What follows is therefore a description of three separate undertakings the new frescoing of the gap and the successive essays in conservation with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each
For the use of students and future restorers a full day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings complete technical reports on what we found and what we did
These may be consulted in the office of the Architect of the Capitol or the Library of Congress
The first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coats all in bad condition
It was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists preparation with a mortar one part slaked lime three parts sand to be put on in two layers
Cartoons were drawn full size after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities
There was some difficulty here
One had to manage the given subjects three diverse recent events so as to make them part of a classical frieze -- that is a pattern of large figures filling the space with not much else against a blank background
Moreover all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his
When it was all arranged to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze the cartoons were tried in place
The scaffolding a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above was strong and safe but obscured visibility
Nothing could be seen from the floor but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses
and we were able to decide on some amplification of scale
To be sure of matching color as well as form pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast and large samples painted in fresco then left two months to dry out to their final key
Later it was gratifying to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came
The scaffold was the length of the space to be painted
What bits of Brumidi and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust
Washed they came out surprisingly clear and bright
It could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described by Cennino Cennini in the 14th Century and current in Italy to this day
That is they used opaque color throughout getting solid highlights with active lime white
Painting `` a secco `` is much in evidence
A brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat
This brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint
In our own practice to have the last `` intonaco `` plaster coat thick enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying we found that it had to be put on in two layers letting the first set awhile before applying the second
The mortar was three parts sand to two of lime
Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us
but to make it stiffer of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking we added a little hydrated lime -- hard on the hands but we could see no other disadvantage
I am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting
As it was it took the pigment well for six hours enough for our purpose and held it firmly in setting
It was obvious that to match Brumidi white must be mixed with all but the darkest tones
Lime white hard and brilliant has a tendency to `` jump `` away from the other colors in drying and also by its capacity to set to preclude the use of ready-made gradations so useful in decorative work
In older Italian practice lime dried and reground `` bianco sangiovanni `` entered into such prepared shades
For convenience we chose a stronger pigment unknown to the early Italians or to Brumidi titanium oxide reserving the active lime white for highest lights put on at the end of the day 's stint
Other pigments were mostly raw umber some burnt umber and a little yellow ochre
This last was probably not in Brumidi 's palette but was needed to take the chill bluish look off the new work next to the old where softening effects of time were seen even after thorough cleaning
The use of `` secco `` we tried to restrict to covering joints
Experience showed however that it is very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven
Later Brumidi and Costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem
We were forced as they were to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark areas
We made it by Doerner 's recipe five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty
ground together they made a strong adhesive which became waterproof in drying
Figure 1 was taken in 1953
The new part is finished
On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group as it looked after cleaning operations which had not yet come around to the other end
where of Costaggini only some foliage has been washed at the point where his work stopped
One is led to speculate as to why the empty space was there left for our century to finish
Costaggini said it was Brumidi 's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle
Brumidi 's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and mutilated his father 's designs ambitiously coveting a bit he could claim for his very own
This question might be settled by comparing the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions noted presumably in Brumidi 's hand above the various sections of his long preparatory drawing which has been kept
Whosever fault it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` histories `` and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California gold
In painting a fresco the handling of wet mortar compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right not to spoil yesterday 's work with today 's plastering
At the very first then Brumidi was required by the classically pyramidal shape of his central group to fill in the triangular space above the seated girl on Liberty 's right before starting on the allegorical figures themselves
Here he put a small man whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning this was to be the closing figure of the party of `` forty-niners `` and was to hold a basket
One sees Costaggini 's rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away
The photograph Figure 1 of the completed frieze shows how having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years he has now been given a hand and by juxtaposition and the permission of the Committee given a new job to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903
The startlingly bright effect of the first washings led the Committee to order the rest of the Brumidi-Costaggini cycle cleaned and restored to go with them
The fixed wooden scaffold was removed and so as to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheels built up from the floor
Every few days in the early morning as the work progressed twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the Rotunda pavement supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting
On this giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor after a first dusting we began to wash
A most useful tool for wetting the surface without running down was made from a greenhouse `` mist spray `` nozzle welded to a hose connection to be used at low water pressure
A valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower
One man sprayed with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting
A second assistant mopped with two sponges
In parts a repeated sponging was needed but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original brightness
No soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions
The painting `` a fresco `` stood up superbly
a little of the `` secco `` came off
Necessary retouching was put on at once
Altogether we found the craftsmanship first rate especially Brumidi 's
We were greatly helped by there being no traces of former restoring
Apparently not more than dusting had ever been done and not much of that
The plaster was sound the intonaco firmly attached all over and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places
The greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings above soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime very conspicuous even after cleaning particularly in the `` Landing of Columbus `` `` Oglethorpe and the Indians `` and `` Yorktown ``
Here the Architect referring to the use of the Capitol as a public building not a museum requested some repainting to maintain decorative effect rather than leaving blank unsightly patches
These frescos have had no care for eighty years
With naked gas jets below and leaky windows above enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium they have survived in a building long unheated in winter hot and damp under the iron dome in summer
Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me
It may well be that when Rudy Pozzatti and I visited your country last spring you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked
As American artists it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible
This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful
Even though we did not see many of your faces it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard from those whom we had the fortune to encounter that we had been in your midst
I am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R.
I can well understand your curiosity
We ourselves are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live
It is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists
There should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter
Pozzatti and I endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes
The time-span of little more than a month can not entitle me to pose as an expert on anything I saw
Too much damage is done by `` experts `` who have spent even less time if any at all in the U.S.S.R.
Nevertheless I consider it reasonable because of my commitment as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific geo-political interests
If this attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view
It is a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority such as artists in any social order
I encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience
That which I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction
Almost as if I were talking about something quite unreal
Apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impressions of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments
Personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice as well
I can not be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue
I am equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long
the aggressive disbelief of those who are romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word `` Revolution ``
the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical horizons
Difficult as it may have been at times Pozzatti and I saw enough talked to enough artists historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear
Artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends of humanity
they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in everyday life
By themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would be very little left worth saving
It can not be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one
On that cold but bright April day we were guests of your government in the reviewing stand of Red Square to witness the poeple 's celebration for Yuri Gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces of the Kremlin
If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence
We stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of Moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor
The grave about half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green the sounds of birds the silence of other graves and the casual paths through small forests
Just yesterday we had met and talked with a living writer a contemporary of the dead poet who is known for his ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously
But today we were aware of only two men
One had taken a flight into uncharted space in the service of science to return as a living hero
The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit
The flowers on his grave attested to the fact that he as well was somebody 's hero
These two recollections form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which to me at least symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and humanism
A struggle that is being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest
The prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity
The socialist environment it was stated had cross-fertilized these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit
When I speculated on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutations might be unable to propagate I was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice
I could not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are non-propagating mules ``
This kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to
After a while we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and illogical comparisons
A chance remark about Lenin 's sealed train brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to George Washington 's cherry tree
Theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern of gaseous masses
No wonder that Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence namely Cultural Exchange
Typical of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union of Soviet Artists
We had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of Moscow 's artists
Instead we became involved in a series of friendly but overly formal welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind
The terms of friendship understanding cooperation etc tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use
I can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion
The presiding female functionary of massive proportions and forbidding appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing the arts
It was only after we had responded with what I fear were similar cliches that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and Laos
She retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there
Unfortunately she returned later just as I had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange Program would be the re-emergence of Abstract Art in Russia with Social Realism regaining dominance in the U.S.
This gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture her on Abstraction
She did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions that Abstraction as well as Impressionism were a Russian invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the U.S.S.R
Pozzatti and I could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in Moscow than elsewhere
We were to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with us the impression that in contrast to other Soviet regions Moscow 's atmosphere is depressingly subdued and official
To have one 's intentions deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste of time
Until our Moscow experience I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally
Artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion
and furthermore I could not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group
To save time some clarification seemed necessary
The following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in Leningrad
`` We have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your ways
Our presence here should also be considered further sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all people
We are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between individuals
In spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit
We are acutely aware that yours is a society which in spite of several wars and many privations has developed itself into one of the foremost nations of the world
Your past history is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect
Your present history is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements
We have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours
While we as American artists believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole
In stating this position we should like to make it clear to you that we can not expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect
As a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other American artists
But certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for similarities between you and us but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding
Like yourselves we have pride and love for our country
To many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignified freedom
As artists we feel the same obligation as do other individuals in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation
The Sane Society is an ambitious work
Its scope is as broad as the question What does it mean to live in modern society
A work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision must necessarily `` fail ``
Even a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots errors of fact and argument important exclusions areas of ignorance and prejudice undue emphases on trivia examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence and the like
Such books are easy prey for critics
Nor need the critic be captious
A careful and orderly man who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be put off by such a book
It is a simple matter for one so disposed to take a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds and ends
The thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large and vigorous family -- a motley jumble of discarded objects some outworn and some that were never useful some once whole and bright but now chipped and tarnished some odd pieces whose history no one remembers here and there a gem everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human condition -- the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users
That could be easily done but there is little reason in it
It would come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush and that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset
I mention these features of the book because they are inherent in the book 's character and therefore must be mentioned
It would be superfluous to build a critique around them
There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm 's account of capitalist civilization
It is worthwhile to recall that Fromm 's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects
Since I have already discussed his moral position that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm 's treatment
I shall first indicate a couple of weaknesses in Fromm 's analysis then argue that granted these weaknesses he still has much left that is valuable and finally raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation
Almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation
Despite its rather long intellectual history alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory
The idea has received much attention in philosophy in literature and in a few works of general social criticism such as The Sane Society
What is missing is work that would answer presumably by the use of survey methods and Guttman-type attitude scales such questions as these What are the components of the feeling-state described as alienation
How widespread is alienation
What is its incidence among the various classes and subgroups of the population
Taking alienation as a dependent variable with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated
Considered as an independent variable how does it affect behavior in various sectors of life
Until such work is done there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who rejected by and in turn rejecting the larger society projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen
I am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work
Nor do I think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual
I am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations
Until such evidence appears we must make do with the evidence we have
Here perhaps Fromm is vulnerable for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather special ways
Three examples follow
Fromm 's analysis of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the bureaucratization of the corporation the separation of ownership from control and the broad and thus from the point of view of corporate control ineffective dispersion of stock ownership
For all these points he relies exclusively on Berle and Means 's study of 1932 The Modern Corporation And Private Property
The broad conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support has suggested important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference and has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area
Fromm seems unaware of these developments
Another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topics he cites such survey-type findings just three times
Moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible
For example he cites the following data from two studies on job satisfaction in the first study 85 per cent of professionals and executives 64 per cent of white collar people and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs
in the second study the percentages were 86 for professionals 74 for managerial persons 42 for commercial employees 56 for skilled workers and 48 for semi-skilled workers
He concludes that these data show a `` remarkably high `` percentage of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers
Starting from other value premises than Fromm 's some analysts might conclude that the percentages really tell us very little at all while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low
Eric Hoffer for example once said that America was a paradise -- the only one in the history of the world -- for workingmen and small children
What matters is that while Fromm 's reading of the data is not the only one possible it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied
Fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in 1945 in which 49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day 's work while 41 per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount
Fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread
That is one way to read the findings but again there are other ways
One might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory an interpretation which would run counter to Fromm 's theory of alienation
Or he might remind Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low after all the medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount
and today 's trade unions announce pretty much the same view
In view of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of survey-type findings on public opinion and considering the criticisms which can be brought against Fromm 's philosophical anthropology such a passage as the following can not be taken seriously
`` Are people happy are they as satisfied unconsciously as they believe themselves to be
Considering the nature of man and the conditions for happiness this can hardly be so ``
The ambiguities suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm 's style of thought
He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways
Sometimes he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and sometimes as an objective diagnostic one
That is sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent
The failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader
It also permits Fromm to do some dubious things with empirical findings
When alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic category for example it becomes clear that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward conquering it
He in effect does say this in his discussion of the pseudo-happiness of the automaton conformist
Starting from this and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread stated worker satisfaction rather than widespread stated worker dissatisfaction
The point is that in a system such as Fromm 's which recognizes unconscious motivations and which rests on certain ethical absolutes empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment
Thus in the example cited above Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being deprived unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious experienced frustrations
He has his cake and eats it too if the workers say they are dissatisfied this shows conscious alienation
if they say they are satisfied this shows unconscious alienation
This sort of manipulation is especially troublesome in Fromm 's work because although his system is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions he asserts that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own consulting room
While the `` empirical psychoanalytic `` label which Fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy it does increase the marketability of his product
The final example of the failure to use available evidence though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered comes from Fromm 's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same themes
In a brief chapter dealing with `` Various Other Diagnoses `` he quotes isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to corroborate his own and finds it `` most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth
'' He finds it equally `` remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the twentieth century ``
There is nothing remarkable about this at all
It is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one 's purposes
There is a difference between evidence and illustration and Fromm 's citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category
Glance at the list Burckhardt Tolstoy Proudhon Thoreau London Marx Tawney Mayo Durkheim Tannenbaum Mumford A. R. Heron Huxley Schweitzer and Einstein
This is a delightfully motley collection
One can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear
The method of selection Fromm uses achieves exactly that
Furthermore the list is interesting for its omissions
It omits for example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English social critics nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious and all those who are with more or less accuracy called Existentialists
Of course the list also excludes all writers who are fairly `` optimistic `` about the modern situation
these almost by definition are spokesmen for an alienated ideology
It is not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion
Turning from these problems of the use of evidence one meets another type of difficulty in Fromm 's analysis which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms
One such instance has already been presented his use of alienation
The only other one I shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism
For Fromm capitalism is the enemy the root of all evil
It is of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one 's social criticism for it makes diagnosis and prescription much easier than they might otherwise be
If one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky 's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections
In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera
such composers as Monteverdi Lully and Purcell with the same goal in mind had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages
Through long experimentation in his songs Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself
Giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words
The moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs and liturgical chants
Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris first monologue for example
Even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance
Aside from Boris himself one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture
Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities defined with economical precision
Consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action Pimen Varlaam Missail and the Jesuit Rangoni
Under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other
each musical setting has an individual touch
Pimen is an old man weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full forte -- but firm and clear of mind
His calmness offers contrast to Grigori 's youthful excitement
A quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life
This theme comes to represent the outer world the realm of battles and banquets -- seen from a distance quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery
It changes and develops according to the text
it introduces Pimen when he comes before Boris in the last act
Once he has been identified however a new melody is used to accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient effect
An imaginative storyteller Pimen takes on the character he describes as if he were experiencing the old shepherd 's blindness and miraculous cure
Here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification of the mood through key relationships
The original D minor seems to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it
As the child addresses the shepherd in a dream light -- in the form of the major mode -- begins to appear and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining D major
Varlaam and Missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated Pimen
Their begging song might easily be a folk melody
The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene
Apparently their origin is humble their approach to life direct and unsophisticated
Whatever learning they may have had in their order does n't disturb them now
Missail is the straight man not very talkative mild-mannered when he does speak
Varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same
A rough ostinato figure heard first in the introduction to the inn scene characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action
The Song Of Kazan in which this figure becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits
The phrasing is irregular and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness
We can imagine how they startled audiences of the 1870 's
Varlaam 's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine but he pulls himself together when the need arises
Both monks respond to the guard 's challenge with a few phrases of their begging song
a clever naturalistic touch is Varlaam 's labored reading of the warrant
As the knack gradually comes back to him his rhythm becomes steadier with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader
For the only time in the opera words are not set according to their natural inflection
to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene
Musically and dramatically Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as Varlaam
His music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with Dappertutto in Offenbach 's Hoffman
His speech shows none of the native accent of the Russian characters
in spite of the Italian name he sounds French
His personality appears more striking by contrast with Marina who is -- perhaps purposely -- rather superficially characterized
Rangoni 's first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it
The effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere
He speaks quietly concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them
He addresses Marina with great deference calling her `` Princess `` at first
it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name placing himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father
Curiously this scene is a close parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time the scene between Amonasro and Aida
Rangoni and Amonasro have the same purpose -- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country 's cause -- and their tactics are much the same
Rangoni begins by describing the sad state of the Church
this brings a reaction of distress from Marina
The music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood it is she he tells her who can bring the truth to Russia and convert the heretics
As if in a trance she repeats his words -- then realizes with a shock her own audacity
This is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him
Now Rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power
It is a phrase as arresting as a magician 's gesture with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness
Another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her to gain power over Grigori by any means even at the cost of her honor
Coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice
Marina rebels at this suggestion
Her pride is as much at stake as her virtue
she is the unattainable beauty the princess who turns away suitors by the dozen
Indignantly she denounces Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her
At once the Jesuit pulls out all the stops
To music of a menacing darkness he describes the powers of Satan gaining control of the girl poisoning her soul with pride and destroying her beauty
The combined threat of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her and she falls terrified at his feet
With another sudden change of mood he is again calm and protective exhorting her to trust and obey him as God 's spokesman -- and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction
Whatever the source of Rangoni 's power Marina is his captive now
we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love duet again throwing a chill over the atmosphere
The most unusual feature of Boris however is the use of the greatest character of all the chorus
This is the real protagonist of the drama
the conflict is not Boris versus Grigori or Shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child but Boris versus the Russian people
Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action
Boris first entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the Coronation Scene with its dazzling confusion of tonalities
We have a brief glimpse of the Tsar 's public personality the `` official Boris `` but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene its bitter resentment and fury in the final act
One reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression
It rarely speaks as a unit
Even in its most conventional appearance the guests song of praise to Marina there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness
In many passages -- for example the council of boyars -- each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion
Hot arguments arise between tenors and basses who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea
The opening scene shows this method at its most individual
Mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those who must suffer the effects of their rulers struggle for power without understanding the causes
They are held in control by force but barely
They will kneel and plead for Boris leadership in a strangely intense song its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath but when the police with their cudgels move away they mock and grumble and fight among themselves
There is a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone
`` Hey Mityukh `` asks one group `` what are we shouting about ``
And Mityukh apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd replies that he has no notion
The jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return
then the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before ending it with a wail of despair
Mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical music with considerable dramatic force
In Pimen 's cell the soft prayers of the monks heard from offstage not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young Grigori 's thoughts and his situation
This is especially striking between Pimen 's quiet exit and Grigori 's vehement outburst against Boris
Again as Boris feels himself nearing death a procession files into the hall singing a hymn its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere The words are hardly calculated to put the Tsar 's mind at ease
They echo the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who `` trembles and begs for mercy -- and there is no mercy ``
The living as well as the dead now accuse him
this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal one
One of the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the St Basil 's scene usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score
Though brief it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy
In addition it is an important link in the plot giving us a revealing glimpse of the people 's attitude toward Boris and the false Dimitri
The mayhem in the forest of Kromy is a natural sequel
The St Basil 's scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the square the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny
In the orchestra we hear first a hushed hesitant pizzicato figure then the insistent `` police `` motif as it appeared in the opening scene
The service is over and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman Mityukh in the lead
They bring the news that the Pretender has been excommunicated
this is met with scorn by the hearers who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk
Mussorgsky cleverly contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment solemn chords or mocking staccatos
There is still more news Mityukh announces they have prayed for the soul of the Tsarevich
So far these remarks like most criticisms of Hardy have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development
For critics Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy or of the London or Max Gate period but simply of Hardy as of a poetic monolith
This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet `` Domicilium `` is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 ``
`` Seeing The Moon Rise `` is dated August 1927
One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years some changes in style and method would have occurred some development taken place
This is not however the case and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense
In a time when poetic style and poetic belief as well seem in a state of continual flux Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency
Though he struggled with philosophy all his life he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties
the `` sober opinion `` of his letter to Noyes written when Hardy was eighty years old is essentially that of his first `` philosophical `` notebook entry made when he was twenty-five `` The world does not despise us it only neglects us `` Early Life p. 63
And though in his later years he revised his poems many times the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty
so that while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy it is difficult to date one
There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy 's development he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his
There is only one Hardy style but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident and when it is not the style is the style of another poet or of the fashion of the time
In the later poems however the personal tone predominates
The bad early poems are bad Shakespeare or bad Swinburne
the bad late poems are bad Hardy
There are two ways of getting at a poet 's development through his dated poems and through the revisions which he made in later editions of his work
About a quarter of Hardy 's poems carry an appended date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive years `` 1908 1910 `` or two separate dates when Hardy worked on the poem `` 1905 and 1926 `` or an approximate date `` During the War ``
These dates are virtually the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems since the separate volumes are neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other
With the exception of Satires Of Circumstance each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades Winter Words spans sixty-one years
the internal organization rarely has any chronological order except in obvious groups like the `` Poems of Pilgrimage `` the `` Poems of 1912 13 `` and the war poems
From the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy 's career in poetry always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative
The dated poems suggest that while Hardy 's concern with poetry may have been constant his production was not
He had two productive periods one in the late 1860 's the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 half of the dated poems are from the latter period and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy 's poems
There was one sterile period only one poem is dated between 1872 and 1882 and except for the poems written on the trip to Italy in 1887 very few from 1882 to 1890
The dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past productions for his various volumes and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time
Poems Of The Past And The Present and Time 's Laughing Stocks both published while Hardy was at work on The Dynasts draw heavily on poems written before 1900
Satires Of Circumstance and Moments Of Vision coming during his most productive decade are relatively self-contained
the former contains no poem dated before 1909 10 -- that is no poem from a period covered by a previous volume -- and the latter has only a few such
The last three volumes are again more dependent on the past as Hardy 's creative powers declined in his old age
These observations about Hardy 's productivity tally with the details of his life as we know them
The first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a vocation before he had decided to write fiction for a living in his note for Who 's Who he wrote that he `` wrote verses 1865 1868
gave up verse for prose 1868 70
but resumed it later ``
During the poetically sterile years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was in addition burdened with bad health he spent six months in bed in 1881 too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at A Laodicean
Two entries in The Early Life support the assumption that during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry
Mrs. Hardy records that `` at the end of November 1881 he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible `` Early Life p. 188
and on Christmas Day 1890 Hardy wrote `` While thinking of resuming the viewless Wings Of Poesy before dawn this morning new horizons seemed to open and worrying pettinesses to disappear `` Early Life p. 302
There are more poems dated in the 1890 's than in the '80 's -- Hardy had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume of his fiction -- but none in 1891 the year of Tess and only one in 1895 the year of Jude
After 1895 the number increases and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated poem -- 1903 when Hardy was at work on The Dynasts
The second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can be related to three events the completion of The Dynasts in 1909 which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years
the death of Emma Hardy in 1912 which had a profound emotional effect on Hardy for which he found release in poetry
and the First World War
It may seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in his seventies but we have it on Hardy 's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen a youth till he was five-and-twenty and a young man till he was nearly fifty `` Early Life p. 42
We may carry this sequence one step further and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only the impetus of two tragedies one personal the other national to loose those powers in poetry
Hardy 's two productive decades were separated by forty years yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself -- it was a narrowing not an expanding process
Like a wise gardener Hardy pruned away the Shakespearian sonnets and songs and the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock of his talent flourish
The range of the later poetry is considerably narrower but the number of successful poems is far greater
We can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities `` Revulsion `` 1866 and `` Neutral Tones `` 1867
There is not much to be said for `` Revulsion ``
Like about half of the 1860 70 poems it is a sonnet on a conventional theme -- the unhappiness of love
Almost anyone could have written it
it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form but it is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike Hardy
The language is the conventional language of the form
there is no phrase or image that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality to the poem
It is smoother than Hardy usually is but with the smoothness of anonymity
It is obviously a young man 's poem written out of books and not out of experience
it asserts emotion without evoking it -- that is to say it is sentimental
There are many such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems
`` Neutral Tones `` we immediately recognize as a fine poem in Hardy 's most characteristic style the plain but not quite colloquial language the hard particular colorless images the slightly odd stanza-form the dramatic handling of the occasion the refusal to resolve the issue -- all these we have seen in Hardy 's best poems
The poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic sources of diction yet it is obviously not ordinary speech -- only Hardy would say `` a grin of bitterness swept thereby
like an ominous bird a-wing `` or `` wrings with wrong `` or would describe a winter sun as `` God-curst ``
The details of the setting of `` Neutral Tones `` are not strictly speaking metaphorical but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the emotions and the elements symbolize each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy 's best poems `` Weathers `` `` The Darkling Thrush `` and `` During Wind and Rain `` for example and to some moving passages in the novels as well Far From The Madding Crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way
`` Neutral Tones `` is an excellent example of Hardy 's mature style drawn from his earliest productive period
I cite it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older as Yeats did but that he simply learned to use better what he already had
In the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man 's sense of the world
if it is somber it is also precise and the precision lends authority to the vision
In `` Revulsion `` on the other hand the pessimism is a case not proven
the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker 's right to speak as he does
In the 1860 70 decade there are many poems like `` Revulsion `` but there is only one `` Neutral Tones ``
Hardy was not Hardy very often
The `` Poems of 1912 13 `` offer a good example of Hardy 's style as it was manifested in the later productive decade
These are the poems Hardy wrote after the death of his first wife
they compose a painful elegy to what might have been to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness and ended in long years of suffering and hatred
Hardy obviously felt that these poems were peculiarly personal and private
he sometimes called them `` an expiation `` and he would not allow them to be published in periodicals
They are the only poems that he rearranged as a group between their first appearance in Satires Of Circumstance and the publication of the Collected Poems
The elegiac tone is Hardy 's natural tone of voice and it is not surprising that the 1912 13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his
The view is always toward the past
but the mood is not quite nostalgic -- Hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable pastness of the past and the eternal deadness of the dead
The poems are the epigraph tells us the `` traces of an ancient flame ``
the fire of love is dead and Hardy stands as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence over the burnt circle of charred sticks and thinks of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted
Critically invisible modern revolt like X-rays and radioactivity is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels where it is called delinquency
`` Disaffiliation `` by the way is the term used by the critic and poet Lawrence Lipton who has written several articles on this subject the first of which in The Nation quoted as Epigraph `` We disaffiliate
'' -- John L. Lewis
Like the pillars of Hercules like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante 's circles stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation the great saxophonist Charlie Parker and Dylan Thomas
If the word deliberate means anything both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves
Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art
Both of them were my friends
Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue
So as the years passed I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration
The last time I saw Bird at Jimbo 's Bob City he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there
`` What happened man ``
I said referring to the pretentious `` Jazz Concert ``
`` Evil man evil `` he said and that 's all he said for the rest of the night
About dawn he got up to blow
The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it
The last time I saw Dylan his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality
It had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter
Being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones
Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end
As artists they were very similar
They were both very fluent
But this fluent enchanting utterance had compared with important artists of the past relatively little content
Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity
The principal theme of Thomas 's poetry was the ambivalence of birth and death -- the pain of blood-stained creation
Music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift
Both of them did communicate one central theme Against the ruin of the world there is only one defense -- the creative act
This of course is the theme of much art -- perhaps most poetry
It is the theme of Horace who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to Parker or Thomas
The difference is that Horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken assurance
To Dylan and Bird it was an agony and terror
I do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity
I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value
Horace 's column of imperishable verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome
Art may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble activity of man
But the other activities of his life partook of these values
They did not actively negate them
Dylan Thomas 's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews
He was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas ovens
As the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven I believe his art became meaningless to him
I think all this could apply to Parker just as well although because of the nature of music it is not demonstrable -- at least not conclusively
Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme attitude life pattern
In the practice of their art there is an obvious technical resemblance
Contrary to popular belief they were not great technical innovators
Their effects are only superficially startling
Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire
Similarly the innovations of bop and of Parker particularly have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado
The tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries
And there is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz no matter how progressive and Dixieland than there is between two movements of many conventional symphonies
What Parker and his contemporaries -- Gillespie Davis Monk Roach Tristano is an anomaly etc -- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation of the older jazz into the basic structure of which it then became an integral part and with which it then developed
This is true of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- Benny Carter Johnny Hodges
It is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously or at least is continuously sprung so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe
This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music
It is the difference between Bach and Mozart
It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry
The special syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith Sitwell -- actually ornaments -- become the main concern
The metaphysical conceits which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still dominant in backwater American colleges were embroideries
Thomas 's ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves
The immediate theme if it exists is incidental and his main theme -- the terror of birth -- is simply reiterated
This is one difference between Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out
Again contrary to popular belief there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either musically or emotionally
His sinuous melody is a sort of naive transcendence of all experience
Emotionally it does not resemble Berlioz or Wagner
it resembles Mozart
This is true also of a painter like Jackson Pollock
He may have been eccentric in his behavior but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles
Partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication
The insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry
It is much more a personal difference
Thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world
Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world
Technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance but it is interesting that Parker following Lester Young was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution
In modern jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional embouchure
Metrically Thomas 's verse was extremely conventional as was incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage Hart Crane
I want to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts
Ornament is confabulation in the interstices of structure
A poem by Dylan Thomas a saxophone solo by Charles Parker a painting by Jackson Pollock -- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves
Confabulation has come to determine structure
Uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the sterile extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals or present blight of poetic professors
Just as Hart Crane had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers -- like Allen Tate for instance to whom Valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities of an Apollinaire let alone a Paul Eluard were nonsense -- so Dylan Thomas 's influence has been slight indeed
In fact his only disciple -- the only person to imitate his style -- was W. S. Graham who seems to have imitated him without much understanding and who has since moved on to other methods
Thomas 's principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now extinct British romantic school of the New Apocalypse -- Henry Treece J. F. Hendry and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets
Parker certainly had much more of an influence
At one time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in America to blow like Bird
Even before his death this influence had begun to ebb
In fact the whole generation of the founding fathers of bop -- Gillespie Monk Davis Blakey and the rest -- are just now at a considerable discount
The main line of development today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them
The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant idiosyncratic
There is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to Eluard or for that matter from Hawthorne through Henry James to Gertrude Stein
The cubist generation before World War 1 and on a lower level the surrealists of the period between the wars both assumed an accepted universe of discourse in which to quote Andre Breton it was possible to make definite advances exactly as in the sciences
I doubt if anyone holds such ideas today
Continuity exits but like the neo-swing music developed from Lester Young it is a continuity sustained by popular demand
In the plastic arts a very similar situation exists
Surrealists like Hans Arp and Max Ernst might talk of creation by hazard -- of composing pictures by walking on them with painted soles or by tossing bits of paper up in the air
But it is obvious that they were self-deluded
Nothing looks anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or Arp
Nothing looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion
Many of the post-World War 2 abstract expressionists apostles of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do look like accidents
The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist but it is a very impoverished appeal
Once again what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals the accidents of painting
It is curious that at its best the work of this school of painting -- Mark Rothko Jackson Pollock Clyfford Still Robert Motherwell Willem De-Kooning and the rest -- resembles nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a Henry McFee itself a formula derived from Renoir
the splashes of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of Hals and Sargent
Often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy -- the pure utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values
You have only to compare such painting with the work of say Sesshu to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly
At its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo decorative surface
Its poverty shows up immediately when compared with Tiepolo where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity and power
A Tiepolo painting however confabulated is a universe of tensions in vast depths
A Pollock is an object of art -- bijouterie -- disguised only by its great size
In fact once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper
Now there is nothing wrong with complicated wallpaper
There is just more to Tiepolo
The great Ashikaga brush painters painted wallpapers too -- at least portable ones screens
A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves can not sustain interest in either artist or public for very long
So in the last couple of years abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures
Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age
Hrothgar 's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg lines 1068 1159 and improvises the tale of Beowulf 's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund lines 871 892
Alcinous court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite Odyssey 8 266-366 and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on Odyssey 8 499-520
Nothing in all this is autobiographical unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity
the poet of The Odyssey reputed blind reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus
Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition
That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey at least is hard to deny
Milman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived
he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas
Proceeding from Parry 's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata Francis P. Magoun Jr. argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations and the thesis is striking and compelling
Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent
The bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very skilful oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty even in a language of many terminal inflections
Assonance seems nearly as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings
The Anglo-Saxon alliterative line and the Homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint
the verse of Beowulf or of The Iliad and The Odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents perforce in earning a livelihood
Yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause
The poet in a written tradition who generally never blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame
But the oral poet can not pause
he must improvise continuously with no apparent effort
Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition
The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which provided for the difficulties of alliteration
the Homeric poet had epithets which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter
Either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns
Other synonyms could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease I shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest possible sense and name for example Gar-Dene a kenning for the Danes
Verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language
Limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other Germanic dialects we can not say how frequently the kennings in Beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same soil
But we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before him would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition
One of the greatest Homerists of our time Frederick M. Combellack argues that when it is assumed The Iliad and The Odyssey are oral poems the postulated single redactor called Homer can not be either credited with or denied originality in choice of phrasing
Any example of grand or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow-craftsmen
The quest of the historical Homer is likely never to have further success
no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be credited to any one man
no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before Christ
This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well
To the extent that a tale is twice told its final author must be suspect although plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi
Combellack argues further and here he makes his main point that once The Iliad and The Odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry Homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they previously found arable
With a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow
Words or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers sometimes accurate and sometimes not
This observation too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry
To the extent that a language is formulaic its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches
W. F. Bryan suggests that certain kennings in Beowulf were selected sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language of Beowulf is formulaic
If the master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements
Once many significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity they are not to be defended for their semantic properties in isolated contexts
It is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of Beowulf such effects as intentional irony
Yet if the argument is turned awry there may be found a great deal in Bryan 's view after all
A formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection
Time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous
A long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate
True we do not know how they were regarded in their day but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases
Nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce
in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation
Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem
no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam
A ship at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek
Even when defenseless of weapons the Danes would be Gar-Dene as their king is Hrothgar and Priam would be EUMMELIHS
Achilles like Siegfried in The Nibelungenlied is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly be called swift-footed even when he stands idle
In Coriolanus the agnomen of Marcius is used deliberately and pointedly but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the hearer `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent ``
The epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet
it was partly his master
The poet 's intentions are difficult to discern and except to biographers unimportant
the language however is a proper object of scrutiny and the effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable
Beowulf and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions
Yet they are written
at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed
Albert B. Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were dictated to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his guild and Magoun argues that the Beowulf poet and Cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion
This explanation is attractive but is vitiated at least in part by the observation that Cynewulf though he used kennings in the traditional manner was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes into his works
If Cynewulf was literate the Beowulf poet may have been also and so may the final redactor of The Iliad and The Odyssey
In lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry recited and became intimately familiar with the established aids to poetizing and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past
Other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory Beowulf may contain a design for terror and The Iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in pottery
The account of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic
Carl Eduard Schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted 2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times
Thus one line in five from The Iliad and The Odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems
The ratio is thoroughly remarkable because the lines are so long -- half again as long as those of Beowulf
Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition
there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric colleague
In determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs
The closest scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets
if any words or phrases are formulaic they will be
The Iliad has two words for the shield ASPIS and SAKOS
Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content to show as M. D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor ``
J. H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective
In his analysis however he touches upon but fails to explore an idea generally neglected in discussions of the book which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative
This essay seeks to make that exploration
Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers
He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response
It is hardly accidental therefore that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands
In Great Expectations the hands become almost an obsession
Mr. Jaggers habitually bites his forefinger a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates half terrifies all who have dealings with him
Miss Havisham 's withered hands heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick
Pumblechook 's `` signature `` is the perpetually extended glad hand
Wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hands together
Old Mr. Pocket 's frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless social-climbing wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair `` and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it `` whereas Joe Gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs. Joe by apologetically drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose ``
Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark were it not that in Great Expectations as in no other of Dickens novels hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book 's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them
Dickens not only reveals character through gesture he makes hands a crucial element of the plot a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero 's relations with all the major characters and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt pursuit crime greed education materialism enslavement by both people and institutions friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption
We have only to think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer in Thomas Burke 's famous story `` The Hands Of Mr. Ottermole `` to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment
So it is with Great Expectations whether the hands be Orlick 's as he strikes down Mrs. Gargery or Pip 's as he steals a pie from her pantry
Such associations suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of Dickens novel but on a deeper plane they relate to the themes of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics
The novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being `` laid hands on `` -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip 's frightened eyes in the churchyard `` as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in ``
Magwitch terrifies Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy 's imagination of a bogy man who may `` softly creep his way to him and tear him open `` `` imbruing his hands `` in him
As Pip agonizes over the theft that his own hands have committed his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost transforming it into `` a phantom devoting me to the Hulks ``
Held upside down in the graveyard Pip clings in terror `` with both hands `` to his convict
later he flees in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to Gargery 's forge for mending
Through such details Dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between Pip and Magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter both their lives
Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds hands naturally represent action and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at
Dickens for excellent psychological reasons never fully reveals Magwitch 's felonious past but Pip at the convict 's climactic reappearance in London shrinks from clasping a hand which he fears `` might be stained with blood ``
Orlick slouches about the forge `` like Cain `` with `` his hands in his pockets `` and when he shouts abuse at Mrs. Joe for objecting to his holiday she claps her hands in a tantrum beats them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees `` and clenches them in her husband 's hair
This last `` rampage `` is only the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head `` dealt by some unknown hand `` whose identity is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action -- the tracing of Orlick 's hammer upon a slate
Pip himself is to feel the terror of Orlick 's `` murderous hand `` in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marshes
Dickens lays great emphasis on the hands in this scene
Orlick shakes his hand at Pip bangs the table with his fist draws his unclenched hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth watered `` for his victim lets his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides `` and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers ``
Orlick might almost be Magwitch 's bogy man come alive a figure of nemesis from Pip 's phantasy of guilt
The scarred disfigured wrists of Mr. Jaggers housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister past for her master coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests makes a point of the `` force of grip there is in these hands ``
Jaggers iron control over her `` she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back `` rests on his having once got her acquitted of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails
It is the similarity between Estella 's hands and Molly 's `` The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting `` that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of Satis House
Finally Magwitch 's pursuit of Compeyson his archenemy and betrayer begins by his holding him in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates in his `` laying his hand on his cloak to identify him `` thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which Compeyson drowns
Magwitch 's hand here ironically becomes the agent of justice
But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence revenge and retribution
Money so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens is here central and hands are often associated in some way with the false values -- acquisitiveness snobbery self-interest hypocrisy toadyism irresponsibility injustice -- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth
Dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip 's five little dead brothers `` who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle `` who seemed to have `` all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets and had never taken them out in this state of existence ``
Pip 's great expectations his progress through illusion and disillusionment turn somewhat as they do for the naive hero of Dreiser 's American Tragedy upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income -- what Wemmick calls `` portable property `` and what Jaggers reproaches Pip for letting `` slip through his fingers ``
Since a gentleman must if possible avoid sullying them by work his hands as importantly as his accent become the index of social status
Almost the first step in the corruption of Pip 's values is the unworthy shame he feels when Estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands `` They had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar appendages ``
Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe 's hands roughened by work in the smithy and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work artificiality and naturalness gentility and commonness coldness and affection -- in fact between Satis House and the forge
When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims `` No do n't wipe it off -- for God 's sake give me your blackened hand ``
Pip 's abject leave-taking of Miss Havisham during which he kneels to kiss her hand signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour
when on the journey to London that immediately follows he pauses nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village the wooden pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity
Incidentally one can not miss the significance of this gesture for Dickens reintroduces it associatively in Pip 's mind at another moral and psychological crisis -- his painful recognition in a talk with Herbert Pocket that his hopeless attachment to Estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic
In both cases the finger-post represents Pip 's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms
A variety of hand movements helps dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond the forge
The vulture-like attendance of the Pocket family upon Miss Havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of Miss Camilla Pocket who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of grief-stricken choking then lays it `` upon her heaving bosom `` with `` an unnatural fortitude of manner `` and finally kisses it to Miss Havisham in a parody of the lady 's own mannerism toward Estella
Pumblechook 's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement
We first see him shaking Mrs. Joe 's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for Pip 's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping Pip 's hands `` for the hundredth time at least `` `` May I -- may I -- ``
in effusive congratulation to Pip on his expectations
We take leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip 's loss of fortune extending his hand `` with a magnificently forgiving air `` and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers `` one of which he identifies with `` the finger of Providence `` and shakes at Pip in a canting imputation of the latter 's `` ingratitoode `` and his own generosity as Pip 's `` earliest benefactor ``
Pip first learns `` the stupendous power of money `` from the sycophantic tailor Mr. Trabb whose brutality to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource of each new customer and whose fawning hands touch `` the outside of each elbow `` and `` rub `` Pip out of the shop
The respectability which money confers implies a different etiquette and upon taking up the life of a London gentleman Pip must learn from Herbert Pocket that `` the spoon is not generally used over-hand but under ``
The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items channel unit combined channel and unit combined arm and file unit record synchronizers inquiry synchronizers and alteration switches
The declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers see page 85
Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand columns 21 75 of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet
When this is the case the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that `` Continuation Cards `` may be used
Thus when specifically permitted the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow
The label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21
i.e it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet
The operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter
Remarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces
Illustrations of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples illustrating the various statements
If a continuation card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards the compiler will generate a NOP and issue an error message
Additional restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions appear on page 106
Reservation of index words and electronic switches
The assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index word and electronic switch names occurs in Phase 3 of the Autocoder processor
The initial availability of index words and electronic switches is determined by a table which is included in the Compiler Systems Tape
This table originally indicates that index words 1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for assignment to symbolic references
index words 97 through 99 are not available
The initial setting of this table may be altered however as described in the 7070/7074 Data Processing System Bulletin `` IBM 7070/7074 Compiler System Operating Procedure `` form Aj
During the first pass of Phase 3 references to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches are collected and the availability table is updated
At the end of this pass the table indicates which index words and electronic switches are not available for assignment to symbolic references
Both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable before the start of assignment in one of the following ways
The initial setting of the availability table indicated that the index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment
The one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify indexing or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic switch e.g 3
The one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an EQU statement e.g
When the index words or electronic switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements described above the position or order of the statements within the program is not important
any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass
During the assignment pass of Phase 3 index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment
Index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways
The first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches
the third applies only to index words
During the assignment pass each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch
When such a reference is found an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment
If the one- or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an XRESERVE or SRESERVE statement see page 99 the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved
If a statement has been assigned an address in the index word area
by means of an actual label or
by means of an origin statement which refers to an actual address the corresponding index word will be reserved
These entries should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each LITORIGIN statement
Otherwise symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words
This method does not apply to electronic switches
The preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized or multi-phase program particularly when used in conjunction with the LITORIGIN statement
Extreme caution should be used however to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address
If the symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an XRELEASE or SRELEASE statement see page 101 the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available regardless of the method by which it was reserved
It will not however be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time
If at any time during the assignment pass the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment the warning message `` No More Index Words Available `` will be placed in the object program listing the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through 96 are available and the assignment will continue as before
If the compiler finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment the warning message `` No More Electronic Switches Available `` will be placed in the object program listing the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available and assignment will continue as before
The resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used e.g through the proper use of the EQU XRELEASE or SRELEASE statements
As noted in Appendix C index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment to symbolic names by the compiler
also index words 93 through 96 may have been made unavailable for assignment
Autocoder declarative statements provide the processor with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations properly
Declarative statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area placed preferably at its beginning or end
Otherwise special care must be taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute something in a data area as an instruction
If the compiler does encounter such statements a warning message will be issued
7070/7074 Autocoder includes the following declarative statements DA Define Area DC Define Constant DRDW Define Record Definition Word DSW Define Switch DLINE Define Line EQU Equate CODE DTF Define Tape File DIOCS Define Input/Output Control System and DUF Descriptive Entry For Unit Records
DA DC DTF and DLINE require more than one entry
The DA statement is used to name and define the positions and length of fields within an area
The DC statement is used to name and enter constants into the object program
Since the 7070 and 7074 make use of record definition words RDWS to read write move and otherwise examine blocks of storage the DA and DC statements provide the option of generating RDWS automatically
When so instructed Autocoder will generate one or more RDWS and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area with which they are to be associated
An RDW will be of the form Af where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy is its ending location
These addresses are calculated automatically by the processor
In some cases it may be more advantageous to assign locations to RDWS associated with DA and DC areas in some other part of storage i.e not immediately preceding the DA or DC areas
The DRDW statement may be used for this purpose
The DRDW statement may also be used to generate an RDW defining any area specified by the programmer
As many as ten digital switches may be named and provided by the DSW statement for consideration by the SETSW and logic macro-instructions
Each switch occupies one digit position in a word can be set on or off and is considered as logically equivalent to an electronic switch
It can not however be referred to by electronic switch commands e.g ESN BSN etc
An individual switch or the entire set of switches in a word may be tested or altered as desired
Through use of the DLINE statement a means is provided for specifying both the editing of fields to be inserted in a print line area and the layout of the area itself
The area may include constant information supplied by the programmer
The area may also be provided with additional data during the running of the object program by means of EDMOV or move macro-instructions
The declarative statement EQU permits the programmer to equate symbolic names to actual index words electronic switches arm and file numbers tape channel and unit numbers alteration switches etc and to equate a symbol to another symbol or to an actual address
The DIOCS DTF and DUF statements are used when required by the Input/Output Control System
DIOCS is used to select the major methods of processing to be used and to name the index words used by Aj
Each tape file must be described by Tape File Specifications produced by Aj
In addition to information related to the file and its records the File Specifications contain subroutine locations and the location of tape label information
A DUF entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type of file and the unit record equipment to be used
The DUF also supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are unique to the file
A full description of the DIOCS DTF and DUF statements is contained in the 7070 Data Processing System Bulletin `` IBM 7070 Input/Output Control System `` form Aj
Brief descriptions of these three declarative statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions of each of the other 7070/7074 Autocoder declarative statements follow below
diocs -- define input/output control system
When the Input/Output Control System is to be used in a program a DIOCS statement must be used to select the major methods of processing to be used
This statement also allows the naming of the index words used by Aj
Source program format
The basic format of the DIOCS statement is as follows anylabel is any symbolic label
it may be omitted
The entry DIOCS must be written exactly as shown
The first item in the operand IOCSIXF is used to specify the first IOCS index word for programs using tape files
This item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 94
If the first item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name IOCSIXF will be assigned
When an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified Autocoder will equate the name IOCSIXF to it
The second item in the operand IOCSIXG is used to specify the second IOCS index word for programs using tape files
This item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 94
If the second item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name IOCSIXG will be assigned
When an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified Autocoder will equate IOCSIXG to it
In the Midwest oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas
The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume
Research at Fayette Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg/l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb
Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds
Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer
Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr hp
O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes
They indicated that a 4-day retention aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent BOD reduction
Later Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months
It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume
Red Bridge Subdivision
With the development of the Red Bridge Subdivision south of Kansas City Missouri the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal
The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years
This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 Aj
For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1
The oxidation pond has a surface area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 Aj
The pond is currently serving 1,230 persons or 260 persons per acre
In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors
It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae
The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate
At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities
The large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer
It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development
The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage
The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom 4 ft below the surface with a volume of 121,000 Aj
The side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion
The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area
The major contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed
The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period
Initially the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period
This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly increasing load over a reasonable period of time
The pilot plant was equipped with a 3-hp turbine aerator Figure 2
The aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds
The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24-hr charts
The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents
The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River through a surface drainage ditch
Composite samples were collected at weekly intervals
The long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent
Weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples
The composite samples were normally collected over a 6-hr period but an occasional 24-hr composite was made
Examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6-hr composite samples with 24-hr operations
The data indicated that the organic load during the 6-hr composites was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr organic load
Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions
Efforts were made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-hr composite sample
A single 24-hr composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical
Pilot plant operations
The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mg/l with an average of 350 Aj
This was equivalent to 240 mg/lBOD on a 24-hr basis
The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision
The BOD in the effluent averaged 58 mg/l a 76-per-cent reduction over the 24-hr period
Examination of the data in Table 1 shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent Aj
The periods of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted
Ice caused the aerator to overload straining the drive belts
The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage
The organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of BOD/day or about 2 lb BOD/day/1,000 cu ft aeration capacity
Needless to say the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis but was 270 lb BOD/day/acre on a surface loading basis
It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system
The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1
With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers
As construction progresses the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced
The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days averaging 6.4 days
The large amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem
The vegetables were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface
A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids
The average volatile suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mg/l while MLSS averaged 170 mg/l volatile suspended solids
The average sludge age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be 14.5 days
The oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 mg/l/hr during the first four months of this study
Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand
The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2 to 2.6 mg/l/hr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds
It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active microbial solids with the heavier less active solids settling out
The suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the Aj
Removal of the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mg/l Aj
The BOD in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 Aj
This low BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study
Routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by McKinney and Gram for the various types of protozoa
It was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation pond
At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor
The bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc
The floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out
Initially the flagellated protozoa predominated but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa
As the temperature decreased the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased
Very little protozoa activity existed below 40-degrees-F
When the temperature reached 32-degrees-F all protozoan activity ceased
but as the temperature rose the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly
Only once were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor
The predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population
One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator
Routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates
The data given in Table 2 show the routine operation of the aerator
The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 1961
An extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water
The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity
It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen
A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate
Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover
The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0-mg. l. dissolved oxygen concentration and 10-degrees-C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3
The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg/l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb/day at a maximum rate of 9.3 Aj
The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer hr hp
The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface
During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted
Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium nitrate
The location of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer
The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mg/l of BOD with an average of 230 Aj
The BOD data are given in Table 4
A single 24-hr composite sample had a BOD of 260 mg/l indicating a typical domestic sewage
The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147,000 gpd giving a retention period of 42 days
The organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb BOD day acre
The effluent BOD averaged 34 mg/l a little lower than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of 60 lb Aj
The BOD of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg. l.
Microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather
When the algae began to build up again the effluent BOD rose
During the two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent BOD 's in the effluent were 18 and 16 Aj
Thus the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping defense of naval forces and area defense
The last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases
To effect these operations five elements exist 1 surface 2 air 3 mines 4 submarine and 5 fixed installations
Surface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations air to furnish area surveillance and mines for protection of limited areas
Submarines and shore installations are new elements
The submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas
Fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection
Mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets
A sixth element not always considered is intelligence
It includes operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment
Operational intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies
intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augmented program in oceanography
The major postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting
Necessity for an over-all concept
Thinking on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut
Proponents of single elements tend to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents has assumed the greatest importance
Consequently air surface and submarine elements overshadow the mine fixed installations and intelligence
These have sought more and more of what they have
Each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others
This despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting
Thus the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed
This is stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would provide positions of relative importance to ASW elements based on projected potentialities
Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective
An over-all concept would have other advantages
It would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach
Now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily
While one element is announcing progress another is delineating its problems
The result can only be confusion in the public mind
A unified concept can serve as a guide to budgeting and if public support is gained will command Congressional support
Industry 's main criticism of the Navy 's antisubmarine effort is that it can not determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how
Lacking guidance industry picks its own areas
The result coupled with the salesmanship for which American industry is famous is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas
An over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest dividends
Therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for co-ordination of the Navy 's efforts for a logical presentation to the public for industry 's guidance and as a basis for a program to the Congress
Principles involved in an over-all concept
That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare
Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world divided between her various fleets
Some are also in Albania and others are on loan to Egypt
Other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become Communist can furnish bases
Communist target areas can be assumed but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions
Attack can come from almost any direction against many locations
Logically then the first principle of the plan must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area
It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building at bases in transit and on station
Destruction of the enemy 's building and base complex however requires attacks on enemy territory which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities
In transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act
The Communists are adept at utilizing hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage
Therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while providing for all-out hostilities its effectiveness is not dependent on general war
Antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between large opposing forces with the decision a result of a single battle
It is a war of attrition of single actions of an exchange of losses
This exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units
Initially having fewer units of some elements -- especially submarines -- than the opponent our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs so that the exchange will be in our favor
Therefore the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types unless at an assured favorable exchange rate
The submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War 2
Its speed has increased it operates at increasingly greater depths its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited and it will become even more silent
The next developments will probably be in weaponry
The missile can gradually be expected to replace the torpedo
As detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges
Therefore the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent
No element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense
Some elements support the others but all have limitations
Some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another
Elements used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements
Therefore the plan 's fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of all elements in combination
Conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces
Numbers would be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution
Shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything
Therefore any measures taken in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur
Therefore the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements
The world is constantly changing
what was new yesterday is obsolescent today
The seventh principle of the plan is self-evident
it must be flexible enough to allow for technological breakthroughs scientific progress and changes in world conditions
Supporting elements in asw operations
To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles delineating its content laid down and the supporting elements listed
Before considering these elements in more detail an additional requirement should be stated
Large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks
Therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage
But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically
Consequently the system giving area coverage if such coverage is less than world wide must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile
Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements air surface sub-surface fixed installations mines and intelligence
These are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result
Intelligence as used herein will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations
These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence
In submarine defense these must have maximum stress
Good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly reduce force requirements and increase tactical effectiveness
Environmental intelligence is just as important
The ocean presently co-operates with the target
Full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development of methods of capitalizing on the environment
Therefore improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and as it supports all other elements rates a top priority
Gathering intelligence is important but of equal importance is its translation into usable form
A program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic research into tactical and operating instructions
Approaching this problem on a statistical basis is invalid because the opponent has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions but under the conditions most advantageous to him
Therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the time of encounter
All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then
Temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and animal life are the chief environmental variables
There may be others
Variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature because more of the variables would be encompassed
These variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically
Progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information
A concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot
Mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets
By its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater counter-efforts
Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets
They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters however and targets must come within a few yards of them
Mines need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment extended to deep water and have their effective area per unit increased
Mines can be used to deny access to great areas
they are difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and can be put into place quickly
A most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package
Effective employment will reduce force requirements
For example effective mine barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the Yucatan Channel from Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense inshore patrol convoy escort shipping control and mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico
More extended systems covering all passage into the Caribbean would free the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico from the previously listed requirements
Systems covering the Gulf of St. Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the United States are not impossible
Such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase in the probability of success
The advantages inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any of the other elements
Fixed installations are increasingly advocated as the problem of area defense emerges
The proponents are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts
Systems which detect submarines over wide areas are attractive although they can be only `` burglar alarms ``
Mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target
Such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically
In an over-all ASW concept dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with proven capabilities
No general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined
In addition proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile system
Fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems
The submarine has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system
It operates in its target 's environment and any advantage gained therefrom by the target is shared by the attacker
But the submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed
Two metabolites 1 and 2 of p-aminobenzoic acid PABA which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Aj
The 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Af
Thirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Aj
All 28 carbons of metabolite 1 a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 arise from Aj
Metabolite 1 isolated from the medium however showed a lower specific activity which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite
Vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 destroyed the biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines
Fragment A has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt and free base
Preliminary evidence tentatively indicates that the molecule metabolite 1 is cleaved at a secondary amide bond

chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation of K.G Untch
studies on esterases
-- Research on esterases in mammalian sera was continued
One of the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to rare earth ions
The inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect of rare earth salts
Various metal ions have been found to protect plasma arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine
The effects can be related to the structure of this enzyme
The non-identity of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established
Furthermore the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian sera and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin or a factor attached to it in addition to arylesterase
Selective inhibitors can distinguish the two activities
Investigations on the acceleration of human plasma cholinesterase were carried further
E. G. Erdos L. E. Boggs C. D. Mackey biophysical studies on modified fibrous proteins
-- Electron-microscopical and physical-chemical methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured collagen and ribonucleic acid
R. V. Rice
A method was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen EWC
It was observed that EWC macromolecules are the same diameter 15 a but much longer up to several microns than vertebrate tropocollagen
This unusual collagen also was shown to undergo a reversible thermal phase transformation
R. V. Rice M. D. Maser studies on peptides and peptidases
-- This investigation involved several aspects
Substance Z an active urinary peptide was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated column chromatography
high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography were used in preliminary structural studies
pharmacological effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in vivo on blood pressure were assayed
special equipment required for registering respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles under various conditions was developed by the Instruments Section Victor Jackman W. C. Barnes J. F. Reiss
and enzymes which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps Substance Z were studied
Experiments are in progress to develop ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions
E. G. Erdos C. D. Mackey A. G. Renfrew W. B. Severs E. M. Sloane seed proteins
-- In a physiochemical study of seed proteins the globulins of the Brazil nut have been investigated
In addition to the known principal globulin excelsin three other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed
A water-soluble protein of quite low molecular weight ca 10,000 has also been found in this system and partly characterized

continuum mechanics and viscoelasticity
theory of non-newtonian fluids
-- On the basis of a differentiability assumption in function space it is possible to prove that for materials having the property that the stress is given by a functional of the history of the deformation gradients the classical theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation has been infinitesimal for all times in the past
By strengthening the differentiability assumption it has been possible to derive second and higher order theories of viscoelasticity
In the second-order theory one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the first-order stress relaxation function
B. D. Coleman with Walter Noll Department of Mathematics Carnegie Institute of Technology viscoelastic measurements
-- An extensive series of measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation free vibration and creep measurements over the temperature range of Af to 80-degrees-C
As many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally
The simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous systems did not hold here
It was possible however to decompose the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two viscoelastic mechanisms each compatible with the Boltzmann superposition principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence factors

trace elements in tektites meteorites and related materials
-- The results of microanalysis of tektites natural glasses of unknown origin for gallium and germanium have shown that these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial or less likely from lunar matter by impact of a celestial body
The gallium germanium ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous metamorphic or sedimentary matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components of the tektite
Gallium oxide is less volatile than silica the main constituent of tektites and germanium oxide is more volatile
Australites tektites from Australia give the appearance of a second melting
In conformity with this conclusion a higher trace gallium content was found in the portion flange that has undergone a second melting
The silicate fractions of stony meteorites show gallium germanium ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone melting at some point in their histories
Libyan Desert silica-glass another natural glass is composed of nearly pure silica and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area
The gallium content however has been enhanced five-fold
This glass is probably formed from Libyan Desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite impact
Nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large terrestrial explosion craters may nevertheless melt only small quantities of material
Most of the impact energy is spent in crushing and fragmentation
When rapid quenching follows melting impact glasses may result
These always contain metallic inclusions
Impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been produced by stony meteorites or comets
No meteorites have ever been recovered from paleoexplosion craters and recent craters containing impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception of Aouelloul crater Adrar Western Sahara Desert
This crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic material has been recovered

Preparation of a coordination compound is often accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol
By applying this general principle a great number of complex compounds of osmium ruthenium iridium and rhenium with triphenylphosphine triphenylarsine and triphenylstibine have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years
Lauri Vaska E. M. Sloane J. W. DiLuzio In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary decomposition of solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were not considered following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in preparative coordination chemistry
Recent work with radiocarbon and deuterated alcohols as solvents however has given evidence that metal-hydrido and carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction with alcohol in some of these systems
Some of the previously reported compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and carbonyl compounds discovered the more representative examples being Af Af Af Af and Af Af
The coordination complexes formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and arsines are being investigated R. G. Hayter
Particular interest is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes
During the past year these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes of nickel 2 and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged complexes of palladium 2 see figure as well as new compounds of the well-known type Af
The structures properties and reactions of these compounds are being studied
In another study chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species prepared homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis are being characterized and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed under varying preparative conditions

structure and properties of macromolecules
elasticity of macromolecular networks
-- The theory of elasticity of Gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the equations of state relating variables of pressure volume temperature stress and strain have been precisely formulated
Simple elongation has been treated in detail
The various stress-temperature coefficients for constancy of volume and strain constancy of pressure and strain and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated
The dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy of compressibility have been related to the elongation
In continuation of these theoretical studies a more precise elucidation of the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought
P. J. Flory C. A. J. Hoeve chain conformations of polymeric chains
-- Recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions of polymeric chains by Volkenstein and Lifson has been extended to include more general types of chains
The mean-square end-to-end distance of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with values deduced from viscosity data
These studies are being extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the hindrances to rotation around chain bonds
C. A. J. Hoeve A A. Blumberg crystallization in polymers and copolymers
-- The crystallization of copolymers comprising Af units interspersed with a minor percentage of Af is limited by the inability of the crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky side group of the latter
Only uninterrupted sequences of the former are eligible for formation of crystallites
Limitations on the lengths of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short crystallites which can be formed and this is reflected in a broadening of the melting range
Robert Chiang J B. Jackson P. J. Flory Carefully executed melting studies on this system M. J. Richardson permit quantitative estimation of the instability engendered by reduced crystallite length
The complex morphology of polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor
Hence the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations in the latter field
Contraction of muscle
-- Glycerinated muscle in the presence of the physiological agent ATP responsible for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins of muscle has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of alcohols and water
Experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees Centigrade and to a concentration range of only several per cent
The contraction therefore partakes of the character of a phase transition
While ATP appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction
C. A. J. Hoeve P. J. Flory anionic Polymerization
-- One of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight distribution
A simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed
The preparation of such products is not new but the systems heretofore employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high purity
In the new process impurities present in the solvent benzene the monomer and in the reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of initiator a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium at a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth
Upon completion of the purging step additional initiator appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added and the system is then warmed to the polymerization temperature at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion
The predictability of the molecular weights was found to be within 10 for the polymers prepared with Af ratios less than 1.1
Contrary to observations with ethers no apparent change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable periods of time in benzene as solvent
In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances
T. V. Barker who developed the classification-angle system was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931
The compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford
Since 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy
Numerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain Holland the United States and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations

Dana 's System Of Mineralogy
Six editions of James Dwight Dana 's System appeared between 1837 and 1892
In 1915 Edward S. Dana editor of the sixth edition asked W. E. Ford of Yale University to prepare a seventh edition of his father 's work
A number of people became involved in the preparation but work was slow until 1937
In that year a grant was obtained from the Penrose Fund of the Geological Society of America to finance additional full-time workers
Money was also advanced by the publishers John Wiley Sons Inc.
Volume 1 was completed in 1941 and published in 1944
The editors of this volume and Volume 2 were the late Charles Palache Clifford Frondel and the late Harry Berman all of Harvard University
Work on Volume 2 was begun in 1941 interrupted by the war in 1942 and resumed in 1945
The volume was completed in 1950 and published in 1951
A supplementary grant from the Geological Society of America helped finance its publication
Besides the editors there were many contributors in the United States and Great Britain to Volumes 1 and 2
W. E. Ford for example continued to supply data on the occurrence of minerals until his death in 1939
Volume 3 is nearing completion and there are plans to revise Volume 1
The project is currently supported by Harvard University

The Groth Institute
`` The Groth Institute `` which was established in 1958 is a group activity affiliated with the Physics Department of The Pennsylvania State University University Park Pa.
Ray Pepinsky is the Director
The Institute derives its name from Paul Von Groth 's Chemische Krystallographie a five-volume work which appeared between 1906 and 1919
The resident staff is large and consists of professional assistants graduate students abstractors librarian technical editor machine operators secretarial help and others
There are also corresponding members and outside advisory groups
The Air Force Office of Scientific Research has provided financial assistance in the early stages of the Institute 's program
All crystalline substances and other solid-state materials
The aim is to collect a very broad range of physical chemical morphological and structural data for crystals on an encyclopedic scale and to seek all possible useful and revealing correlations of properties with internal structure
Sources of data
The first stage of operation has centered on the literature imaging of critical or summarizing tabulations such as the Barker Index
Coverage of primary literature will follow
Unpublished data will be available to the Groth institute from cooperating groups and individuals
Critical evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this project
However the proposed correlation of the many interrelated properties of crystals will reveal discrepancies in the recorded data and suggest areas for reinvestigation
In addition the availability of computers will permit recalculation and refinement of much structural information
Use of nomenclature symbols units physical constants
For punched-card or tape storage of information all literature values must be conformed to a common language
In this way a degree of unification of nomenclature symbols and units will be realized
Because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration fermentation salting chemical treatment canning refrigeration and freezing
The basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption
In earlier years the preservation of food was essentially related to survival
In the more sophisticated atmosphere of today 's developed nations food-preservation techniques have sought also to bring variety peak freshness and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer
With the development of nuclear technology isotopic materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world
An early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled
Interest remained however in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations
Factors responsible for the spoilage of foods
The chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are 1 microorganisms such as bacteria molds and yeasts 2 enzymes 3 insects 4 sprouting and 5 chemical reactions
Microorganisms are often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods
Of special concern is the growth of bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum which generate poisonous products
Enzymatic action in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability
Spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment as in corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity
Sprouting is a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes onions carrots beets and similar root vegetables
Insect infestation is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain
The presence of parasitic organisms such as Trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which must be dealt with in food processing
To permit the storage of food for long periods of time a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic action
The term `` sterilization `` applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms
Food treated in this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration
The process of `` pasteurization `` involves milder and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction of most but not all of the microorganisms
Less severe thermal treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes
General effects of ionizing radiation
Ionizing radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or at lower doses can inhibit their action
It furnishes a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic organisms present in meats
Deactivation of enzymes is also possible although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 Mrad or more
Because of undesirable flavors odors colors and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching
Radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food
It will however inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables
The radiation doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following ranges 1
For radiosterilization to destroy all organisms for long-term preservation -- about 4.5 Mrad for nonacid foods of low salt content
For radiopasteurization to partially destroy microorganisms
results vary with types of food storage conditions and objectives of treatment -- commonly of the order of 0.2 Mrads but up to about 0.8 Aj
For destruction of insects -- about 25,000 Aj
For inhibiting the sprouting of root vegetables -- 4,000 to 10,000 Aj
Preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects particularly at the higher radiation dosages
In this respect the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has to date been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods
A number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and palatability however at dosages substantially less than sterilization levels
Moreover the nutritive value of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little if any change although some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization doses
For irradiation of food the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation and X-ray gamma and high-energy electron radiation are suitable
Aside from availability and economic considerations each has certain practical advantages
for example gamma rays give deeper penetration but can not be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiated
Selection of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most important costs
Of the potentially useful sources of ionizing radiations gamma sources cobalt-60 cesium-137 fission products or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems
Of the various particle accelerators the Van De Graff machines resonant transformers and linear accelerators are the principal ones available for commercial use
Costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation processes
Estimated production costs of radiation energy from machine and nuclide sources range from 1 to 10 per Aj
Conventional energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per kwhr for process steam
Radiation therefore is at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization or radiosterilization
What are the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the future
It has been estimated that for applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for gamma radiation generated in a reactor core
No comparable reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen
Such projections however appear highly speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond those foreseen for food-preservation facilities
Because agricultural activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered geographically and because of the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location the use of large central processing stations where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt range might be utilized is inherently impracticable
Present status of irradiation preservation of foods
The objective of complete sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time
Chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military services
For them providing appetizing food under battle or emergency conditions is a paramount consideration
They require completely sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration preferably items already cooked and ready to eat
High nutritional value variety palatability and appetizing appearance are important for reasons of morale
Foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration are also of interest
Of primary interest are meats
Radiopasteurization which produces fewer adverse sensory changes in food products has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items
Thus food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability
Commercial interest is chiefly in this type of treatment as is military interest under peacetime conditions
The present status of food preservation by ionizing radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs
The radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation
To date the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is pork
Of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization is superior in palatability to available canned pork products
Tests with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development of off-flavors
A prime objective of the Army Quartermaster Corps program is to find the reasons for beef 's low palatability and means of overcoming it since it is a major and desirable dietary item
Partly because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes before radiosterilization treated fresh meats have the appearance of boiled or canned meat
Off-flavor is a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats but problems of commercial acceptability remain
Moderate radiation doses of from 100,000 to 200,000 rads can extend the shelf life at 35 F of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks
However the problem of consumer acceptability remains
The preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts
Cooked beef irradiated in the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color
When lamb and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses the meat becomes dehydrated the fat becomes chalky and again unnatural changes in color occur
Ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities
However a major problem here is one of scale of processing
ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities
The problems of color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid cuts
Specialty cooked items containing meat portions as in `` frozen dinners `` might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization
The principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen
A refrigerated item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type
Competitive processes for preserving meats are by canning and freezing
Costs of canning meat are in the range of 0.8 to 5 cents per pound
costs of freezing are in the area of 2 to 3.5 cents per pound
The table on page 10 shows costs of canning and freezing meat and estimated costs for irradiation under certain assumed conditions
Under the conditions of comparison it will be noted that 1
Radiosterilization at 3 Mrad is more expensive than canning particularly for the cesium-137 source
2
Radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137 source is in the range of freezing costs
3
Irradiation using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator
Results of irradiation tests with poultry have been quite successful
At sterilizing doses good palatability results with a minimum of changes in appearance taste and odor
Radiopasteurization has also been successful and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared with about 10 days for the untreated product
Acceptable taste and odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken
Acceptance of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed however for two reasons 1 the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation and distributing practices and 2 treatment by antibiotics a measure already approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.5 cents per pound
Fresh seafood products are extremely perishable
Although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately
Furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible
The instrument is shown in Fig 1 and consists essentially of a hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating
The force required to accomplish removal is plotted by means of an electronic recorder against distance of removal
Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness
This too is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut
A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals glass wood and plastic surfaces
The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out
Hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests
The instrumental method however is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time
If a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating
At low thicknesses a cutting or shearing phenomenon is often encountered
As the coating becomes thicker the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure
If the coating becomes still thicker a peeling type failure finally can occur
The typical appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in Figs 2 3 and 4 which are single frame enlargements of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process
It can be seen from Fig 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating
The molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface
The pictures of Figs 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at or close to the interface between coating and substrate
If the force required to remove the coatings is plotted against film thickness a graph as illustrated schematically in Fig 5 may characteristically result
Here H is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and T is the film thickness
It can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal
Also it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature
It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness
Presumably the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case
What then are the factors that contribute to these phenomena
Why should the `` practical adhesion `` of a coating as assessed by a knife method change initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness
Cutting mechanism of cohesive failure
The cutting or shearing removal process has been previously described
It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure
The details of the removal process are shown schematically in Fig 6
The various forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane which makes an angle yf with the substrate
The action and reaction forces are R and Af respectively and are equal and opposite in direction
All the other force vectors are derived from these
Af is the force required to cut a coating of thickness T from the substrate
Af is the shear force along the shear plane
Af and Af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife respectively
Af is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane
Af is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces and P is the normal force acting on the face of the knife
yc is the rake angle of the knife
yf is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate
yt is the friction angle
and yb is the angle the resultants make with the plane of the substrate
An analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle yc and the friction angle yt determine the vector direction Af of the force resultants R and Af
Consequently both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process
It is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of R directly
In actual practice the values most readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force Af and the shear angle Aj
These two values and the rake angle yc are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships
yc is defined by the geometry of the knife
yf can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate
Af is instrumentally determined
From Fig 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is Af where yl is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material W is the width of the removed coating and T is its thickness
If the cutting force Af is plotted against film thickness a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope Af
However in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn 1
One of these is the fact that the knife employed no matter how well sharpened will have a slightly rounded cutting edge
This signifies that yc the rake angle is no longer a constant to zero film thickness
The curvature of this bluntness is in the case of the Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer determined by the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mil
The force vector concept of Fig 6 can readily be applied to this condition also
Because the rake angle Af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller or even negative when compared to the value of yc for the major portion of the knife a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result
This reduces to the relationship Af where Af is the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn 1 Af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife tip Af is a straight line first approximation of this roundness and the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn 1
It can be seen that Af is a constant and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife
The blunter the knife the higher is the value of Af
The importance of a hard abrasion-resistant knife material like the Carboloy employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent
Softer knives would blunt very rapidly making the value of Af inexact
In extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a measurement
A second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate
This is not a constant value like Af but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the resultants R and Af of Fig 6
Under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust Af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of Af
The resultant friction force Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness
The value of Af can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings
A straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of Af against load L having slope k and Af
Since the load L under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af it can be seen that Af
The measured force H in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating Af that due to the bluntness of the knife Af and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate Af or Af
The first two forces are directly interrelated and depend upon film thickness whereas Af is independent of these two and is a constant for a given knife/coating combination
These theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig 7 and their sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig 5 for the cutting mechanism
Chipping mechanism of cohesive failure
Although a large number of coatings systems particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place
This is a chipping dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle coatings resins or very highly pigmented films
This is shown in the photomicrograph of Fig 8
The basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane
The detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied extensively by Merchant for metal cutting and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings
By studying high speed movies made of this type of failure the sequence of relationships as schematically illustrated in Fig 9 could be observed
In the first picture 9a the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation
In the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to the inclined work surface
With increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases
Eventually rupture occurs along the shear plane 9e and the cycle repeats itself
Merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used
Consequently if the shear angle yf is replaced by the rupture angle Af the relationships as described in eqns 1 2 4 and 6 will directly apply
The cracking mechanism
Under equilibrium cutting conditions the chip exerts a force Af against the coating and an equal opposite force Af against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig 6
If the rake angle yc of the knife is high enough and the friction angle yt between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for Af the resultant vector R will lie above the plane of the substrate
Within only a few years foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight
Urethane foam as only one example was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955
Yet last year 's volume probably topped 100 million lb and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb by 1964
Many of the other foamed plastics particularly the styrenes show similar growth potential
And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated
As this issue goes to press for example one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength
another reports that a cellular polypropylene primarily for use in wire coating applications is being investigated
On the following pages each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail as to properties applications and methods of processing
It might be well to point out however some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved
In urethane foams for example there has been a definite trend toward the polyether-type materials which are now available in two-component rigid foam systems and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding
Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets
Urethane foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention
In one outstanding example Whirlpool Corp. found that by switching to urethane foam insulation they could increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models
Much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams including spraying frothing and molding see article p. 391 for details
And in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment interlining new adhesives and new methods of laminating foam to a substrate have been developed
New techniques for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost that particular material into a number of new consumer applications including picnic chests beverage coolers flower pots and flotation-type swimming toys
Two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable styrene 's growth during the year were packaging molded inserts replacing complicated cardboard units and foamed-core building panels
Extruded expandable styrene film or sheet -- claimed to be competitive price-wise with paper -- also showed much potential particularly for packaging
Sandwich panels for building utility shelters that consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused interest in the construction field
In vinyl foam the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material for details see P. 395
Better `` hand `` a more luxurious feel and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result
Several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent
Readers interested in additional information on foams are referred to the Foamed Plastics Chart appearing in the Technical Data section and to the list of references which appears below
Since the mid 1950s when urethane foam first made its appearance in the American market growth has been little short of fantastic
Present estimates are that production topped the 100-million-lb mark in 1960 85 to 90 million lb for flexible 10 or 11 million lb for rigid
by 1965 production may range from 200 to 350 million lb for flexible and from 115 to 150 million lb for rigid
The markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations
Furniture upholstery as just one example can easily take millions of pounds
foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer
and use of the foam for garment interlining is only now getting off the ground with volume potential in the offing
Urethane foams are basically reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates usually tolylene diisocyanate
Blowing can be either one of two types -- carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon
The most important factor in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production
Originally the main types used were various compositions of polyesters
These are still in wide use today particularly in semi-rigid formulations for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural panels foamed-in-place insulation automotive safety padding arm rests etc
More recently polyethers -- again in varied compositions molecular weights and branching -- have come into use at first for the flexible foams just lately for the rigids
The polyether glycols are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired in cushioning
Although the first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method today thanks to new catalysts they can be produced by a one-shot technique
It is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours and with superior properties to latex foam
The polyester urethane foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters
the polyether group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol or polypropylene glycol modified with a triol
One shot vs. prepolymer
In the prepolymer system the isocyanate and resin are mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs
The foaming can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of catalyst in solution
In one-shot the isocyanate polyester or polyether resin catalyst and other additives are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately
Basically this means that simpler processing equipment the mixture has good flowing characteristics and less external heat the foaming reaction is exothermic and develops internal heat are required in one-shot foaming although at the same time the problems of controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are critical ones
Most commercial uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lb cu ft. for rigid foams between 1 and 3 lb cu ft. for flexible foams
This latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average of 5.5 lb cu ft. in commercial grades
Compression strength
Graph in Fig 1 p. 392 indicates how the ratio of compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased
The single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example
By varying the formula this curve may be moved forward or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression strength density ratio
Thermal conductivity and temperature resistance
In flexible urethane foams we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials primary performance remains functionally useful
In temperature resistance this quality is usually related to specific properties e.g flexural tensile strengths etc
Thermal conductivity is directly traceable to the material 's porous air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which form its composition
These air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers
The K factor a term used to denote the rate of heat transmission through a material B.t.u./sq ft. of material/hr./ 0F./in of thickness ranges from 0.24 to 0.28 for flexible urethane foams and from 0.12 to 0.16 for rigid urethane foams depending upon the formulation density cell size and nature of blowing agents used
Table 1 p. 394 shows a comparison of K factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials in common use including two different types of rigid urethane foam
Flexural strength
This term refers to the ability of a material to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by bending
The higher-density urethane semi-rigid foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance i.e the 12 lb cu ft. foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 3 lb cu ft. density
Note that flexural strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another
Where flexural strength is an important factor be sure that your urethane foam processor is aware of it
Tensile strength
This property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart
like compression strength of urethane foams it has a direct relationship to formulation
Exceptional tensile strength is another of urethane foam 's strong features
Figure 2 above shows the aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change in tensile strength during exposure to ultra-violet light
There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product
The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape it can be molded it can be poured-in-place it can be applied by spray guns etc
Slab stock is still one of the most important forms of urethane end-product in use today
Basically the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units a variable mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many cases a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidifies into foam
The ingredients are fed from tanks through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate
The mixing head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle
It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure the material can be cut into lengths as desired
Much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate the slab stock into finished products
Profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce sine triangle trapezoid and other profiles in variable heights dimensions etc
The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically
Also available is a slitter which `` peels `` the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd in length down to 1/16 in thick
The low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be tailor-made to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case liners materials handling containers packaging and cushioning devices and such novelties as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports and gas pedal covers
Although slab stock appeared first it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with irregular shapes crowned contours or rounded edges the cutting of slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process
Only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market
The closed molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material molding in open molds was more feasible
Satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether foams were never fully achieved
Closed molding generally resulted in parts weighing more because of higher density than parts fabricated from free-blown foams
This counteracted the gain from having no scrap loss
In addition there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of gel strength in the rising foam and problems of splits
The introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems aided by the development of new catalysts helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding
While there are still many bugs to be ironed out the technique is fast developing
Simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured pumped etc into a void where they foam up to fill the void
In a typical application -- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels -- an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20 more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a jig
Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 90-degrees-F 29 32-degrees-C
The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs
Sixty lbs loading is possible but 40 lbs is adequate
The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe thus returning suds to soap box and the machine is started
The 160-ml bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen
Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls
At the conclusion of the washing 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F 32 0C are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs 4 liters to each tub
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes
During the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins
At this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge
When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs
The run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line
By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste from the suds box drains
This method of rinsing appears to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition
Suggested evaluation and classification
Evaluation may be made on either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired
A reflectance-measuring instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning whereas Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal
Purpose and scope
This test method is intended for determining the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics made of fibers other than wool to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home
Four washing test procedures are established varying in severity from very severe to very mild and are intended to cover the range of practical washing from commercial procedure to hand washing
Five drying test procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques used in the home and commercial laundry
Three methods for determining the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering
These tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes after repeated launderings
Table 1 summarizes all of the various washing drying and restoration procedures available
The person using these tests must determine which combination of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry
It is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code consisting of a Roman Numeral a letter and an Arabic number
For example Test 3 E 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed by procedure `` 3 `` at 160-degrees-F for a total of 60 minutes in the machine has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure `` E `` and has been subjected to restorative forces on the Tension Presser by procedure `` 1 ``
A specimen or garment is washed in a cylindrical reversing wash wheel dried and subjected to restorative forces where necessary
Temperature and time of agitation in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees of severity
Drying procedures and application of restorative force procedures are varied to conform with end-use handling during home or commercial laundering
Distances marked on the specimen in warp and filling directions or wales and courses for knitted fabrics are measured before and after laundering
Apparatus and materials
wash wheel -- cylindrical wash wheel of the reversing type
The wheel cage is 20 to 24 inches inside diameter and 20 to 24 inches inside length
There are three fins each approximately three inches wide extending the full length of the inside of the wheel
One fin is located every 120-degrees around the inside diameter of the wheel
The wash wheel rotates at a speed of 30 revolutions per minute making five to ten revolutions before reversing
The water inlets are large enough to permit filling the wheel to an eight-inch level in less than two minutes and the outlet is large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in less than two minutes
The machine is equipped with a pipe for injecting live steam that is capable of raising the temperature of water at an eight-inch level from 110-degrees to 140-degrees-F 38 0 to 60 0C in less than two minutes
The machine shall contain an opening for the insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment for determining the temperature of the water during the washing and rinsing procedures
It is equipped with an outside water gauge that will indicate the level of the water in the wheel
A domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent results may be used
The wash wheel is the equipment preferred for the test
Pressing equipment -- flat-bed press measuring 24 inches by 50 inches or larger
Any flat-bed press capable of pressing a specimen 22 inches square may be used as an alternative
The flat-bed press is maintained at a temperature not less than 275-degrees-F 135 0C
Dryer -- dryer of the rotary tumble type having a cylindrical basket approximately 30 inches in diameter and 24 inches in length and rotating at approximately 35 r.p.m
The dryer is provided with a means of maintaining a drying temperature of 120-degrees 160-degrees-F 49 0 71 0C measured in the exhaust vent as close as possible to the drying chamber
Screen drying racks -- 16-mesh screening Saran or Velon
Drying room -- facilities for drip- or line-drying
Extractor -- centrifugal extractor of the laundry-type with a perforated basket approximately 11 inches deep by 17 inches in diameter with an operating speed of approximately 1,500 r.p.m
Pen and ink indelible -- or other suitable marking device
measuring scale --
Soap neutral chip -- fed Spec 566 or Aj
Softener -- e.g sodium metaphosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate if needed in hard water areas
Detergent synthetic -- alkylarysulfonate type
Flatiron electric -- approximately 3 lb
tension presser -- consisting of a padded ironing board from which extend clamping members on all four sides
Two of the clamps are fixed to the edges of the board whereas two clamps travel on guide rails opposite the fixed clamps
The movable clamps travel on carriages which ride the rails and are drawn by dead-weight loading
Sets of weights are provided so that the load can be selected in the range of 1/2 to 4 pounds
A perforated aluminum plate used to provide the drying surface is heated by means of a flatiron
A special template is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a specimen for a central measuring area and the fabric extensions to the clamps see Fig 2
Knit shrinkage gauge -- consisting of a set of 20 mounting pins set in guides in radial slots Fig 1
Each pin is individually sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in the slot
The springs have an extension of 1 inch at Af tension
The tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane of the test specimen
The minimum diameter of the pin frame in the collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely extended state unloaded is 14 inches
The surface of the apparatus in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as to be as friction-free as possible
The preparation of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional restorability procedure if any to be used
Three specimens for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory average of performance
This is especially true for knitted fabrics
Specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of Af and Af and then laid out without tension on a flat polished surface care being taken that the fabric is free from wrinkles or creases
Fabrics that are badly distorted in their unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional change results when laundered by any procedure
This also holds true if restorative forces are applied
Therefore it is recommended that in such cases the sample be replaced or if used the results of dimensional change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative only
Generally it is necessary to mark distances on a specimen or garment in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and to measure before and after laundering
The distances may be marked with indelible ink and a fine-point pen by sewing fine threads into the fabric or by a specially designed stamping machine
The marked distances are parallel to the respective yarns
Usually the greater the original distances marked the greater will be the accuracy of the test
Distances of less than 10 inches are not recommended
Woven fabrics to be dried by procedure b flat-bed pressed or restored by procedure 3 hand ironing
The specimen of fabric is a rectangle at least 22 by 22 inches except for cloth narrower than 22 inches in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric
Three distances each at least 18 inches are measured and marked off parallel to each of the warp and filling directions
The distances are at least two inches from any edge of the specimen

Mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen and indelible ink
also place three dots on the specimen at each side of the 10 inch square one dot at midpoint and one at approximately 1/2 inch from each corner
Measure and record
Circular knitted fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 2 knit shrinkage gauge
Each specimen is approximately 16 inches square
The markings consist of a centrally located 10 inch diameter measuring circle and a 14 inch diameter circle of 20 dots equidistantly spaced See Figure 1
Critical measurements in length and width directions should be taken before and after washing drying and restorative procedures
The washing procedures are summarized in Table 2
Place the specimen in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry load of Af pounds
Start the wash wheel and note the time

this level will be increased by condensed steam
When this water level has been reached inject steam into the wheel until the temperature reaches that shown in Column B of Table 2

High-gain photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability
Examples of such situations are aerial night reconnaissance the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues special radiography in medical or industrial applications track recording of high energy particles etc
High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods
some of these are listed below A
Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems B
Channel-type secondary emission image intensifier C
Image intensifier based upon the `` multipactor `` principle D
Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers TSEM tubes E
Cascading of single stages enclosed in one common envelope
Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely
Channel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values
they suffer however from an inherently low resolution
Image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned
However the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain
TSEM tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution
However electrostatic focus important for many applications has not been realized for these devices
Resolution limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic aberrations
Furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support can not be tolerated
Cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution
These tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members
The electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one
The magnification may be smaller equal or larger than unity
An electrostatic system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen or interstage coupler is utilized while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the solenoid which is heavy and bulky
As it will be discussed later peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber couplers
It should be noted however that the paraxial resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems
It is felt that fiber-coupled double- and multi- stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance in the future
Therefore we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes
The luminous efficiency and resolution of single stages fiber couplers and finally of the composite tube will be computed
It will be shown theoretically that the high image intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits the utilization of extremely low incident light levels
The effect of device and quantum noise associated with such low input levels will be described
After these theoretical considerations constructional details of a fiber-coupled double-stage X-ray image intensifier will be discussed
Measured performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed
The conclusion shall be reached that fiber-coupled double-stage tubes represent a sensible and practical approach to high-gain image intensification
Basic design of a fiber-coupled double-stage image intensifier
The tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now
The electron optical system see fig 14-1 is based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode and anode surfaces
The inner anode sphere is pierced elongated into a cup and terminated by the phosphor screen
The photoelectrons emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres pass through the negative lens formed by the anode aperture and impinge upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen
The cylindrical focusing electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential
The anode potential codetermines the gain G and magnification M of the stage
Both the photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved concave as seen from the anode aperture
The field-flattening property of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or coupling member
For the same reason the output fiber plate is planoconcave its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent record is desired
As it will be shown later the field-flattening properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design
The second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates
The photocathode sensitivities S phosphor efficiencies P and anode potentials V of the individual stages shall be distinguished by means of subscripts 1 and 2 in the text where required
Both stages are assumed to have unity magnification
Theoretical discussion of flux gain
flux gain of a single stage
The luminous gain of a single stage with Af flux gain is to a first approximation given by the product of the photocathode sensitivity S amp lumen the anode potential V volts and the phosphor conversion efficiency P lumen/watt
In general P is a function of V and the current density but it shall here be assumed as a constant
The luminous efficiency Af of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant sensitivity Af and on the spectral distribution of the incident light Af by the relation Af where Af is normalized radiant photocathode sensitivity
Af is standard visibility function
The luminous flux gain of a single stage is given by Af
If the input light distribution falls beyond the visible range Af as expected since Af
Such cases are not considered here
Efficiency of fiber couplers
The efficiency of fiber optics plates depends on four factors A
numerical aperture N.A
B
end Fresnel reflection losses R
C
internal losses I.L
D
packing efficiency F.R
The numerical aperture of the fibers is given by Af where Af
The angle Af is measured in the medium of index Af
Settled phosphors as generally used in image intensifiers have low optical contact with the substrate surface hence Af shall be assumed
The numerical aperture should be in general close to unity
This condition can be satisfied e.g with Af and Af or equivalent glass combinations
A sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the angle independent Fresnel formula Af
For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces and assuming Af we obtain Af percent
This value may be reduced to 4.6 percent by means of a very thin glass layer of index 1.5
Hence the Af factor for the output fiber coupler is Af
As the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the SbCs-type lies around 2 the Fresnel losses at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the Af factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95
It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further
The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the prescribed cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections of the core-jacket interface
These losses depend on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular distribution of the incident light
Explicit expressions integral averages are given in the literature
Lacking reliable data for some of the variables we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent internal losses for 1/4-inch long small 5 10 M diameter fibers
This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal reflections
Since we are considering here relatively small diameter 1 1.5 inches fiber plates their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent per plate
The packing efficiency F.R of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used until rather recently
For circular fibers in a closely packed hexagonal array the packing efficiency is given by Af where Af and 0.906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribed hexagon
For the small diameter fibers now technically feasible and required for about 100 Af resolution Af
The cladding thickness is about 0.5 M hence Af and Af
Thus the efficiency yt couplers is given by -- Af or approximately 50 percent each
It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a mica membrane in addition to an optical output lens system
The efficiency Af of an Af lens at the magnification Af is Af
Neglecting absorption the end losses of the coupling membrane and the output window Af would be 6 percent and 8 percent
Thus the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates with a combined efficiency of 0.25 is 0.043 or about six times less than that of the two fiber plates
Gain of fiber coupled image intensifiers
Including the brightness gain Af due to the Af area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is Af
It is obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which maximizes Af for a given input E in the case of the second stage for the first phosphor screen emission is very important
The same consideration should govern the choice of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate sensor e.g photographic emulsion
We have evaluated the `` matching integrals `` for two types of photocathodes S-11 and S-20 and three types of light input
The input light distributions considered are P-11 and P-20 phosphor emission and the so-called `` night light `` N.L as given by H.W Babcock and J. J. Johnson
The integrals in units are listed in table 14-1 below
Theoretical discussion of paraxial device resolution
resolution limitations in a single stage
The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen
The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations
It has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity magnification
Furthermore the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high voltage
In general a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution
The luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from Eq 6 for the 16 possible combinations of S-11 and S-20 photocathodes and P-11 and P-20 phosphor screens for night light and P-20 light input
The P-20 input is of interest because it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray fluorescent screens
The following efficiencies obtained from JEDEC and RCA specifications were used Af
The following table 14-2 lists the luminous gain values computed according to Eq 6 with Af
The possibility of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has been pointed out
It is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels
Space charge influences will also decrease at increased voltages
Electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography
A resolution of 70 80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible
The inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness with increasing anode voltage decreases with decreasing porosity thus the advantage of cathodophoretic phosphor deposition and might be impaired by the normally used aluminum mirror
Thus in general elementary light optical effects light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit
It should be noted that photoluminescence due to `` Bremsstrahlung `` generated within the viewing screen by electron impact appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess of 30 KV are utilized
It has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 Af at high voltage values of approximately 20 Aj
For the further discussion we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 Af and phosphor screen resolution of 60 Af
The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or more simply the policy
An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem 1
The specification of the state of the process stream
2
The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect
3
The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired
For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species and the temperature or pressure of the stream
For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied
the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter
The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing
it is the subject of Chapter 4
The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman
He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process
Moreover by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal Af-stage policy for the remaining stages we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages
Proceeding in this way from one to two and from two to three stages we may gradually build up the policy for any number
At each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied
To see how important this economy is let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables
then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Af where a is some number not unreasonably large
To proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for interpolation
this number will be of the order of Af
If however we are seeking the optimal R-stage policy for a given feed state only one search for a maximum is required at the final step
Thus a number of operations of the order of Af are required
If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously Af operations would be required to do the same job and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program
But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy namely that for the given feed state and R stages
In contrast the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages
If the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search
But Af is vastly larger than R
No optimism is more baseless than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the crudest of methods in searching out a result
Suppose that Af and that the average operation requires only Af sec
Then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia
The principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process
Bellman 1957 has annunciated in the following terms
`` An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision ``
This is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation
It appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer
At the same time every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end
2.2 the discrete deterministic process
Consider the process illustrated in Fig 2.1 consisting of R distinct stages
These will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream so that stage R is the T stage from the end
Let the state of the stream leaving stage R be denoted by a vector Af and the operating variables of stage R by Af
Thus Af denotes the state of the feed to the R-stage process and Af the state of the product from the last stage
Each stage transforms the state Af of its feed to the state Af in a way that depends on the operating variables Af
We write this Af
This transformation is uniquely determined by Af and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic
In practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set S
The set of vectors Af constitutes the operating policy or more briefly the policy and a policy is admissible if all the Af belong to S
When the policy has been chosen the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation 1
thus Af
The objective function which is to be maximized is some function usually piecewise continuous of the product state
Let this be denoted by Af
An optimal policy is an admissible policy Af which maximizes the objective function P
The policy may not be unique but the maximum value of P certainly is and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by 2 and 3 as a function of the feed state Af
Let Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af
When it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af
For any choice of admissible policy Af in the first stage the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by Af
This is the feed state of the subsequent Af stages which according to the principle of optimality must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to this state
This will result in a value Af of the objective function and when Af is chosen correctly this will give Af the maximum of the objective function
Thus Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af and Af is related to Af by 5
The sequence of equations 6 can be solved for Af when Af is known and clearly Af the maximization being over all admissible Af
The set of equations 5 6 and the starting equation 7 is of a recursive type well suited to programming on the digital computer
In finding the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages only the function Af is needed
When Af has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of Af and the whole calculation repeated
We also see how the results may be presented although if n the number of state variables is large any tabulation will become cumbersome
A table or set of tables may be set out as in Table 2.1
To extract the optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af we enter section R of this table at the state Af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function
In the third column is given the optimal policy for stage R and in the fourth the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used
Since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to Af we may enter section Af of the table at this state Af and read off the optimal policy for stage Af and the resulting state Af
Proceeding in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and if it is desired we can check on Af by evaluating Af at the last stage
It may be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af as when the cost of the operating policy is considered
A moment 's reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case
A form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af
Here P represents the value of the stream in state P and Q the cost of operating the stage with conditions Q
Hence P is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that is the net profit
If Af denotes the net profit from stage R and Af then the principle of optimality gives Af
This sequence of equations may be started with the remark that with no process Af there is no profit i.e Af
2.3 the discrete stochastic process
The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only statistically is also of interest although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process
In this case the stage R operating with conditions Af transforms the state of the stream from Af to Af but only the probability distribution of Af is known
This is specified by a distribution function Af such that the probability that Af lies in some region D of the stage space is Af
We can not now speak of maximizing the value of the objective function since this function is now known only in a probabilistic sense
We can however maximize its expected value
For a single stage we may define Af where the maximization is by choice of Af
We thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given Af
If we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first
Then Af the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space
The type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here except that now the fourth column is redundant
The third column gives the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage R and enter the preceding section of the table at this state
The discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter
2.4 the continuous deterministic process
In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process
We replace r the number of the stage from the end of the process by t a continuous variable which measures the `` distance `` of the point considered from the end of the process
The word distance is used here in a rather general sense
it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process
If T is the total `` length `` of the process its feed state may be denoted by a vector p T and the product state by p Q
P denotes the state at any point T and Q the vector of operating variables there
A gyro-stabilized platform system using restrained gyros is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination
The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion neglecting transient effects as follows Af where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro
The platform angle yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling
This is normally termed the gyro input axis 90-degrees away from the gyro output or yj axis
The gyro angular momentum is defined by H
Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the yf axis the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj
It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes
In the system shown in Fig 7-1 the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer
This torque causes the entire system to rotate about the yf axis since the response to Af
If the polarities are correct the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero
As the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases
Finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled
A mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in Fig 7-2
The platform is initially off level by the angle Aj
The angle generated by the platform servo yf multiplied by G is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer
Af is the scale factor of the accelerometer Af
The voltage Af is amplified by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af
Finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af
The system as indicated in Fig 7-2 is fundamental and simple because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have been neglected
With these factors included an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations
In this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time
When the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain
The time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain
In addition the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain
i.e high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations
This problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time
It must be noticed in Fig 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration
The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af
In practice the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe
When the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers
There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around the vehicle etc
One of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise
One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters
This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt
Since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached
One of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a non-linear amplifier for Af
The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level
Below this level the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering
The effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process
When the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system amplifier Af
The platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer output when amplified by Af will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift
The amount of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system
Practical leveling considerations
The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros
The system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits
However the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform
This leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically as long as the system is actuated
A useful by-product of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level
The leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment
The process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero
The turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above
In brief the human replaces amplifier Af in Figs 7-1 and 7-2
Manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs
If high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs this also minimizes the noise problem
With integration the effect of a small acceleration or small platform tilt angle can be seen after a time
However skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy
Also it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach
Manual leveling is inconvenient if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time
The operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled
This process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random
Platform heading
Platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator
In simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction
For purely inertial navigators two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading
Use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading
The choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish the heading
External determination of heading -- surveying technique
With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques
The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure
Before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined
A mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit
A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north
This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques
With the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned
The sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on the accelerometer mirror
When the platform is aligned the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed hairs
The images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy
The platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers
Although this technique is simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist the direction of true north must be known for each launch point
However this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days work
In many installations the inertial platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight
With this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment
If the platform is not too high off the ground a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform
Obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand
The transit can be replaced by an autocollimator
This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading
The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the Z-gyro torquer
If the polarity is correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero
Information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the Z-axis gyro
If the Z gyro is drifting a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift
If the drift error is systematic it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required compensating current
Electrical pickoffs
It is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform
Essentially the stator or reference portion of the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero
Gyrocompass heading
Gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading
For the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the X accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction at the base point and the Y accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point
The accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform
Thus if one accelerometer is properly aligned the other is also
The input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers
Figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro vectors arranged as described above
The platform is leveled and properly headed so that the X-gyro input axis is parallel to the east-west direction and the Y-gyro input axis is parallel to the north-south direction
The input axis of the X gyro when pointing in the east-west direction is always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth
If the platform is not properly headed the X-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth 's rotation
The sensing of this rotation by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading
In Fig 7-4 the input axis of the three-axis platform is shown at some point on the earth
The point is at a latitude yl and the platform is at an error in heading east
The earth is spinning at an angular velocity zq equal to one revolution per 24 hr
When the platform is level ye is a rotation about the Z axis of the platform Af
Since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating with respect to the earth
The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary election produced `` no evidence `` that any irregularities took place
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee which had over-all charge of the election `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta `` for the manner in which the election was conducted
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities `` in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr.
`` Only a relative handful of such reports was received `` the jury said `` considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city ``
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ``
It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ``
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ``
However the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ``
The City Purchasing Department the jury said `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ``
It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy `` this problem
Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury
It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ``
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department 's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes
`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program `` the jury said but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County which receives none of this money
The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ``
Nevertheless `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds `` the jurors said
`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden `` on Fulton taxpayers
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation
The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations `` of two previous grand juries the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee
`` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms `` the jury said
Regarding Atlanta 's new multi-million-dollar airport the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences ``
The jury did not elaborate but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ``
Ask jail deputies
On other matters the jury recommended that 1
Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail ``
2
Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable `` pension plan for city employes
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department the Fulton Tax Commissioner 's Office the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department
Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife Pearl Williams Hartsfield in Fulton Superior Court Friday
His petition charged mental cruelty
The couple was married Aug. 2 1913
They have a son William Berry Jr. and a daughter Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin
Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon
The petition listed the mayor 's occupation as `` attorney `` and his age as 71
It listed his wife 's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika Ala.
The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd Aj
Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor 's attorney
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta with exception of one brief interlude since 1937
His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923
The mayor 's present term of office expires Jan. 1
He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor 's race a top official said Wednesday
Robert Snodgrass state GOP chairman said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker
In the Blue Ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters
Despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to Republicans who attended
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no -- and there were no dissents
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken 1
Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or 2
The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform
Sam Caldwell State Highway Department public relations director resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov Garland Byrd 's campaign
Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time
He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville who has been an assistant more than three years
When the gubernatorial campaign starts Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly
Before adjournment Monday afternoon the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made
Gov Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment
Vandiver likely will mention the 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item
Meanwhile it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some 3 million to 4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work
A revolving fund
The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov Marvin Griffin
The Highway Department source told The Constitution however that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds
Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a 10 per day increase in expense allowances
Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie `` vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought
While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5
As of Sunday night there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education something it has consistently opposed in the past
Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education provided that such funds be received and expended `` as state funds
Barber who is in his 13th year as a legislator said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it the resolution passed ``
But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution
The resolution which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday will be formally read Monday
It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds `` the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority `` to teacher pay raises
-- After a long hot controversy Miller County has a new school superintendent elected as a policeman put it in the `` coolest election I ever saw in this county ``
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated Felix Bush a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday 's election and Bush got 402
Ordinary Carey Williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order
`` This was the coolest calmest election I ever saw `` Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said
`` Being at the polls was just like being at church
I did n't smell a drop of liquor and we did n't have a bit of trouble ``
The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however
It was marked by controversy anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence
The former county school superintendent George P. Callan shot himself to death March 18 four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board
During the election campaign both candidates Davis and Bush reportedly received anonymous telephone calls
Ordinary Williams said he too was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise
`` Everything went real smooth `` the sheriff said
`` There was n't a bit of trouble ``
Austin Texas
-- Committee approval of Gov Price Daniel 's `` abandoned property `` act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation
Under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it
Daniel termed `` extremely conservative `` his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic ``
It permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more
The bill which Daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer
The escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property Daniel declared
Dewey Lawrence a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers
`` If you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy `` he said
`` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars ``
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies ``
His contention was denied by several bankers including Scott Hudson of Sherman Gaynor B. Jones of Houston J B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin
Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional `` since he said it would impair contracts
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last Monday
Austin Texas
-- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas Harris Bexar Tarrant and El Paso would be 451,500 which would be a savings of 157,460 yearly after the first year 's capital outlay of 88,000 was absorbed Parkhouse told the Senate
The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school
Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. Red Berry and Joe Ratcliff
While details are still to be worked out Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry 's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected
`` We 're getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting `` said Ratcliff
`` But I believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also
I 'm willing to stake my political career on it ``
Rep. Berry an ex-gambler from San Antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later
The house passed finally and sent to the Senate a bill extending the State Health Department 's authority to give planning assistance to cities
The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar
One validated acts of school districts
Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District
The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted
Without dissent senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district
Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site
Two tax revision bills were passed
One by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized
Instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a 1,000 fine
It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League
The other bill by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris would relieve real estate brokers who pay their own annual licensing fee from the 12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds
Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 of El Paso to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas
Marshall Formby of Plainview former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress eliminating the need for costly special elections
Under Formby 's plan an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor lieutenant governor speaker of the House attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court
Austin Texas
-- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot when Texas votes on a U.S. senator
Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill
The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by two-thirds majorities before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot Roberts said
Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice
All Dallas members voted with Roberts except Rep. Bill Jones who was absent
Austin Texas
-- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas big cities Thursday
Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise a Wise County hamlet of 250 people
When the shouting ended the bill passed 114 to 4 sending it to the Senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse
The bill would increase from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway Cotten 's attack
The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas Eligio Kika De La Garza of Mission Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs
`` This is a poor boy 's bill `` said Chapman
`` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds
This would help the little peanut districts ``
Austin Texas
-- A Houston teacher now serving in the Legislature proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods ``
Rep. Henry C. Grover who teaches history in the Houston public schools would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods `` courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate
A normal year 's work in college is 30 semester hours
Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching
The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects
`` A person with a master 's degree in physics chemistry math or English yet who has not taken Education courses is not permitted to teach in the public schools `` said Grover
College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses
Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal

State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon `` citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program
The report culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load
The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown desertion and ADC dependency ``
`` Must solve problem ``
The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars said C. Virgil Martin president of Carson Pirie Scott Co. committee chairman
`` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence `` Martin said
The volume of ADC cases will decrease Martin reported when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color
These he said are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC ``
Calls for extension
Other recommendations made by the committee are
Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives including both parents as a means of preserving family unity
Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy
Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday
The disclosure by Charles Bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client Alan Clements 30 a separate trial
Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom
Fears prejudicial aspects
`` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client `` Bellows told the court
`` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others ``
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired `` You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ``
`` Yes your honor `` replied Bellows
`` What this amounts to if true is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case
There is a conflict among the defendants ``
Washington July 24
-- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio
The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port Mass a White House spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go `` toward completion
Decisions are made
Asked to elaborate Pierre Salinger White House press secretary replied `` I would say it 's got to go thru several more drafts ``
Salinger said the work President Kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia 's demands and proposals for the city
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means ``
Karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence `` of the 50 persons
He said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens ``
Karns ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases
In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case ``
Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler special prosecutor
Issue jury subpoenas
Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury
Mayer Goldberg attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation
Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning
Karns said it was a `` wrongful act `` for Wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room ``
He said this constituted a `` very serious misuse `` of the Criminal court processes
`` Actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court `` said Karns who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court
Faced seven cases
Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons
Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary `` miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another
The cases involved judges in the 33d 24th and 42d precincts of the 31st ward the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward the 18th precinct of the 4th ward and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward
The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns
Two other cases also were under advisement
Claims precedent lacking
After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them
Washington Feb. 9
-- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs
The President in a special message to Congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research
The aged care plan similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator a fight on Capitol hill
It was defeated in Congress last year
Cost up to 37 a year
It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes
The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first 4,800 of pay per year
The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system
The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 1963 if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs
Outlays would increase
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963
Both figures would go higher in later years
Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years
These would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes
Nursing home care
The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1
Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days
Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital
A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula `` allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit
Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient
Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged
Calls proposal modest
He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay ``
`` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs `` he said `` and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals
`` This is not a program of socialized medicine
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital ``
Would n't pay doctors
The plan does not cover doctor bills
They would still be paid by the patient
Apart from the aged care plan the President 's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools
The President said the nation 's 92 medical and 47 dental schools can not now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care
Moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they ca n't afford the schooling costs
Contributions to schools
The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students
The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships based on need of up to 2,000 a year per student
In addition the government would pay a 1,000 `` cost of education `` grant to the schools for each 1,500 in scholarship grants
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966
The President recommended federal `` matching grants `` totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones
More for nursing homes
In the area of `` community health services `` the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction
He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial `` appropriation for `` stimulatory grants `` to states to improve nursing homes
He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals
In the child health field the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children 's bureau
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute
Asks research funds
The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation
He did not say by how much
For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase from 30 to 50 millions in matching grants for building research facilities
The President said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine
The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them ``
Reaction as expected
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines
Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President 's plan
Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message
Senate Republican Leader Dirksen Ill. and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck Ind said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance
Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first
House Speaker Sam Rayburn D. Tex called the Kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing `` but made no prediction on its fate in the House
Washington Feb. 9
-- Acting hastily under White House pressure the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation 's federal housing chief
Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote
A number of scattered `` ayes `` and `` noes `` was heard
Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency
In the last eight years all Presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor
Enforce by demand
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse D. Ore. in connection with President Eisenhower 's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy 's in 1961
The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings
This has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes
In Oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist `` powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence
In the case of Portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension
The general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members votes since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive
Even Norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the NATO line
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk 's speeches as `` inconclusive ``
But he hastened to add that if United States policies were not always clear despite Mr. Rusk 's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy
A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited
The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite Mr. Rusk 's personal popularity that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots
The Secretary of State himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months
But where the core of NATO is concerned the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States profound attachment to the alliance `` cornerstone `` of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO 's disposal in European waters
The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole
The secretary 's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection
The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent
This increase in the `` threshold `` as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliance 's most difficult problems in the months to come
Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled
The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time
There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos
The United States State Department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam
They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this
The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated
But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference
This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make
It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration
Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas
But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises
How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression
Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union
He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy 's tendency to be too conciliatory
It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it
They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans if they had been in power would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders `` in Cuba
One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score
His reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now
But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first
The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton R of Kentucky chairman of the Republican National Committee that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination
Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard Boston University Brandeis and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators
This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups ``
It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds ``
Mr. Nixon for his part would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation
But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors
Aid plans revamped
Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration
Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements
Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed
But thus far there has been no response in kind
Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations
In Laos the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture
Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze `` the military situation in Laos
But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate
And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service `` and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos
But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos
Some SEATO nations disagreed however
There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors Thailand and South Viet Nam
The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos
The pro-Western government which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist `` government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army
There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma whom it felt was too trusting of Communists it gradually had to relinquish them
One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright D of Arkansas chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal `` of Prince Souvanna
The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation ``
In an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the President 's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems
The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend
The President has also called upon the Attorney General the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem
Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett a special assistant to the Attorney General as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime
His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 each year showing an increase in offenders
Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director Raymond H. Hawksley the present city CD head believes
Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally `` to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time
East Providence now has no civil defense program
Mr. Hawksley the state 's general treasurer has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years
He is not interested in being named a full-time director
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil defense program Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs
Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin he said
Along with a director the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized
Mr. Hawksley said
One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director he said is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program
Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said
Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station
He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area
Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack
The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point he said and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another
Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point
Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack
Such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know
If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director Mr. Hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally
One of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid
Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind
Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly
The governor 's move into the so-called `` blue law `` controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant deputy city clerk of Central Falls
A copy was released to the press
Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant
The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature
While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views ``
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent 's cooperation the governor said
`` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings `` Mr. Notte said `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws ``
The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales ``
The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws
Should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation
There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws
The statutes similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath
The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday
The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday `` the council 's resolution said
The small shops `` must be retained for they provide essential service to the community `` according to the resolution which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors ``
It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue `` to the local government
The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business `` on Sunday
They `` operate on a volume basis `` it was contended `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community ``
Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties George H. Reama nationally known labor-management expert said here yesterday
Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare `` type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system
He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day
He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 ``
That he added was when he was `` a very young man a machinist and toolmaker by trade
`` That was before I studied law
Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party
The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track
He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track ``
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources
He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties
Mr. Reama who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it ``
He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze `` -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy Mr. Reama said `` A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own ``
Mr. Reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town
William A. Martinelli chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr.
The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post
Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days
He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work
A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled
Mr. Martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead
Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures
He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible
Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement
He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes
`` After inspiring this I think we should certainly follow through on it `` he declared
`` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement ``
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission
`` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement `` he indicated `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town ``
He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September
Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the town 's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses ``
Several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday 's special North Providence Town Council meeting
Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance
At the last session of the General Assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition
Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense
-- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes Democratic gubernatorial candidate that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism ``
Mitchell was for using it Jones against and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs
Hughes said Monday `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired
Now he 's gone the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state ``
Sunday he had added `` We can love Eisenhower the man even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership ``
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign
`` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ``
He asked
The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy `` while working in his adminstration
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall 's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue
Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president
`` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign `` he said `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign ``
The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes remark
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary
He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign
State aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority and making New Jersey attractive to new industry
Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate `` Must share the blame for this ``
Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform
`` But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time `` Mitchell said
Jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for Mitchell
He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises
`` He calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you ca n't have it both ways `` Jones said
The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue ``
Earlier Mitchell said in a statement
`` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes
His reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the president 's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations
`` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste
`` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature
It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes discredit ``
Sees Jones ahead
Sen. Charles W. Sandman R-Cape May said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination
Sandman state campaign chairman for Jones was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel Newark of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones
Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party 's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years
Sandman said `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway
It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he can not answer any questions about New Jersey 's problems
`` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington
That failed
`` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case 's candidacy of last year
That too will fail ``
Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. Westfield as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee
Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women 's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman
County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them
The proposal Sheets said represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word ``
Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January 1964
Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines
The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County was supported today by Edward W. Roos West Orange public safety commissioner
Sheeran a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization 's candidate Freeholder William MacDonald for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals
`` My experience as public safety commissioner `` Roos said `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience and preferably one who is a lawyer
Jim Sheeran fits that description ``
-- William J. Seidel state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development has retired after 36 years of service
A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state
Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies
In October 1944 he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section
Under his supervision the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting
He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station
He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens
He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education
-- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state ``
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn `` When I come back here after the November election you 'll think You 're my man -- you 're the kind of governor we 're glad we elected ``
He said `` We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just and not what is expedient at the time ``
In his only attack on the Republicans Hughes said `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary
But we 'll have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform
We 'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson
`` We 'll take the truth to the people and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November ``
He said `` You can see signs of the Republicans feeble attack on the Meyner administration
But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead ``
He urged New Jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy ``
He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry
`` We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean `` the former Superior Court judge said
`` To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s ``
Calling the Democrats the `` party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people `` Hughes asked `` a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November ``
Hughes supported Gov Meyner 's `` Green Acres `` plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development
He said legislation for a 60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday
The plan will provide 45 million for purchase of open land by the state
The other 15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis
Hughes said `` This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it `` pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950
He said `` Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve ``
Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved
He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans
`` After the primary `` he promised `` I 'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration
I 'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee ``
-- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues
The outgoing members whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election received carved wooden elephants complete with ivory tusks to remember the state committee by
There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters
A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee
She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women 's suffrage amendment
She served one four-year term on the national committee
Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates
At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor 's reported plan was generally favorable
Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years
The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor 's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders
Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party
Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary
These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city
Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor
In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley the Bronx Democratic leader and with Joseph T. Sharkey the Brooklyn Democratic leader
Mayor visits Buckley
As usual he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio the Manhattan leader
He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party
Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader 's home for a discussion of the situation
Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization 's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle
In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader 's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa who lives in the Bronx from this year 's ticket
But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa 's successor
Screvane and Beame hailed
The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane who lives in Queens to replace Abe Stark the incumbent as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame who lives in Brooklyn to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller
The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx
After his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterday 's New York Times
The Mayor said
`` It did n't come from me
But as I have said before if I announce my candidacy I will have something definite to say about running mates ``
Boston June 16
-- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts
There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics
The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same ``
`` It 's See Joe see Jim `` he says
`` The hand is out ``
A political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters `` who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control
These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy the object of which is to plunder them ``
Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor 's novel `` The Last Hurrah ``
But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject
A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations
And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state
A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery or worse is the norm in Massachusetts public life
Day after day some new episode is reported
The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent 8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property
An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate
Washington June 18
-- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers
In the Senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition
In the House the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration 's housing bill while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill
The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee
It is expected to be reported out Tuesday but this is a little uncertain
The panel 's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble Democrat of Arkansas who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn 's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor
Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday
Leadership is hopeful
The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans
The Democratic leadership however hopes to pass it sometime this week
The 6,100,000,000 measure which was passed last Monday by the Senate provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families
It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories
The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy
They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts
Three groups to meet
What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958
This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science languages and mathematics
Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee
About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps
In the 40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval 26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies
Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage Gordon Boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a Washington interview
Six of these were proposed by religious groups
They will be for teaching agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia Africa the Middle East and Latin America
Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals
There are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example
Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled
When he protested the hotel owner said
`` Why do you worry
The U. S. Government is paying for it
The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers ``
`` I do n't work for the Government `` the American said
`` I 'm a missionary ``
The hotel owner shrugged
`` Same thing `` he said
And then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical church-state problem
Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state
R. Sargent Shriver Jr. director of the corps is certain that they can
No religious group he declared in an interview will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes
Moscow June 18
-- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said beaming `` Look he took everything I had ``
Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker
Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid
The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations
The Communist countries allocated more than 1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year according to Western estimates
This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954
In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries
United Nations N. Y. June 18
-- A committee of experts has recommended that a country 's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations
This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations
One effect of the proposal which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength as in the past would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India
India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants
The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report
The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations
Formula is due this week
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week
The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines
Each of the organization 's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts such as political affairs officer a department head or an economist to start
Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts
Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point
Geneva June 18
-- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom
The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum Premier of the pro-Western royal Government
Prince Souvanna Phouma leader of the nation 's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc and Prince Souphanouvong head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces
The latter two are half-brothers
Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos
An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task diplomats conceded
But no one was overly optimistic
Tactics studied in Geneva
W. Averell Harriman of the United States Malcolm MacDonald of Britain Maurice Couve De Murville France 's Foreign Minister and Howard C. Green Canada 's Minister of External Affairs concluded meanwhile a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference
The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week
Princess Moune Prince Souvanna Phouma 's young daughter read the Princes statement
They had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation `` she said
The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks which are to last three days
The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days
To deal with principles
The meetings in Zurich the statement said would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government

-- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route
Pennsylvania Avenue named for one of the original 13 states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it
Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government 's tremendous buildings plus shrines and monuments
Of course 1600 Pennsylvania the White House is the most famous address of the free world
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about seven-stories high
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about 169 years old
In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade
They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote
In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time
Seats on square
Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country 's most valuable records are kept
Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation
Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania powered with lines that are underground
Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square opposite the White House
In this historic square are several statues but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson hero of the Battle of New Orleans
Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units
About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade
Division one of the parade will be the service academies
Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas the respective states of the President and of Vice-President L. B. Johnson
Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union
Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states
division four will be headed by the Navy followed by 11 states
division five by the Air Force followed by 11 states
Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard followed by the reserve forces of all services five states Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands Guam American Samoa the trust territories and the Canal Zone
Jackson Miss
-- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi
Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state 's immediate political future
This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov Ross Barnett
Barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well
Consequently it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year
Could be scramble
Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor 's office
There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble
Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon `` he had in the 1960 legislative session
If Barnett does n't call a special session in 1961 it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session
The odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year
Legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the 22.50 per diem is not certain and if they start agitating
Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure
The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state 's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat
With eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic Delta district and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature
Mississippi 's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House
Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck
And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together
Barnett as the titular head of the Democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary
With a Democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election
Now the picture is clouded and even US Sens James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status
Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen
Baton Rouge La
-- The Gov Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governor 's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses
The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue
But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government
The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent
The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program
But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation
Indeed the administration 's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat
The administration could not say why 28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program
The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote
The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes
Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy
If it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration
He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature
Actually Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway
Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration
This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly
They would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual
Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition
He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle
Then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the 28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period
It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that 28 million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one
But if the administration should find it does not need the 28 million for a grant-in-aid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes
This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash
It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year
If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma
Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues
In either case it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser
The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor
It is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem
But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year
A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize
Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves
The new year might see some house-cleaning either genuine or token depending upon developments to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms
City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track `` with the city
Estimates of the city 's loss in the 344,000 job have ranged as high as 200,000
Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate `` bids of competing contractors
The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts `` on the project but got paid anyway Hemphill said
The Controller 's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday
The city has sued for the full amount of the 172,400 performance bond covering the contract
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project
The signature of Harold V. Varani former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor
Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter
The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959
The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries Inc. both of 3646 N. 2d St. filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law
On Monday the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization
Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish Jr.
Intervenes in case
The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms
Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co.
At Berger 's direction the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there
`` I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated `` Berger said
The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track
The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints
The city paid for work on 75 of which no more than 21 were repaired Hemphill charged
Wide range in bids
Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of 500 for each joint
The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge Mass which listed the same officers as Hughes was 600 per joint
But Hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from 2400 to 3100 per joint
Berger 's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference
Wagner said the city paid only 37,500 to the Hughes company
`` We wo n't know the full amount until we get a full report `` Wagner said
`` We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond `` Berger said
Wagner replied `` Ca n't you just see the headline City Hooked for 172,000 ``
know enough to sue
Berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount ``
Douglas M. Pratt president of the PTC who attended the meeting said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El
`` We want to find out who knew about it `` Pratt said
`` Certain people must have known about it ``
`` The PTC is investigating the whole matter `` Pratt said
Samuel D. Goodis representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year
Goodis voiced his objection before City Council 's Finance Committee
For hotels with 1000 rooms the increased license fee would mean an expense of 5000 a year Goodis said
Testifies at hearing
His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses permits and city services
The new fees are expected to raise an additional 740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and 2,330,000 more a year after that
The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses hotels and multi-family dwellings to 5 a room
The cost of a license now is 2 with an annual renewal fee of 1
Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels
The city expects the higher rooming house hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional 457,000 a year
The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses
A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer who formerly raised pedigreed dogs
The ordinance would increase fees from 1 for males and 2 for females to a flat 5 a dog
Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city 's services to animal care
In reply Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than 115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only 43,000 in fees
He reported that the city 's contributions for animal care included 67,000 to the Women 's S.P.C.A
15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and 15,000 to investigate dog bites
Backs higher fees
City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees which he said had been under study for more than a year
The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees he said
The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis
Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard 's hit-run car
The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower Davenport said
Barnard who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges was fined 500 by Judge Warren K. Hess and placed on two years probation providing he does not drive during that time
He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning
Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery 39
His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation
The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the 300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project
The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project
One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for 12,192,865
The tract is bounded by Island Ave. Dicks Ave. 61st St. and Eastwick Ave.
Four parks planned
It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority 's master plan and will feature row houses garden apartments four small parks schools churches a shopping center and several small clusters of stores
The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm a Philadelphia builder for work in the project
The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp. a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders which is interested in developing part of the project
Would bar vehicles
The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp.
The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic
It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project
The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave. which on original plans ran through the center of the development
The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project
Kansas City Mo Feb. 9 UPI
-- The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work
Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden 42 the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union suffered multiple fractures of both ankles
He was in Baptist Memorial hospital
Ignition sets off blast
The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work
`` I 'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway `` he said
Gladden 's wife and two of his sons John 17 and Jim 13 were inside the house
The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall
Hood flies over house
The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house
The left front wheel landed 100 feet away
Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device containing either TNT or nitroglycerine was apparently placed under the left front wheel
It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car 's starter
Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night
The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union
Led fight on teamsters
Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union 's battle against the teamsters which began organizing city firemen in 1959
The fire fighters association here offered a 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing
A 500 reward was offered by the association 's local in Kansas City Kas
The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden 's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett
Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee
Both have been active in the association
Ankara Turkey Oct. 24 AP
-- Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president
An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat
By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago the army general staff led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government
The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president
Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months
The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned
Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own

Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically E. M. Martin assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night
Martin who has been in office in Washington D. C. for 13 months spoke at the council 's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel
He told some 350 persons that the United States challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways following their own paths
`` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which if not identical is congenial with ours `` he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty
Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice he said was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union
He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in and added `` so long as people rebel we must not give up ``
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans
`` The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build `` he said
By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare he said
Individual help best
`` We have no reason to fear failure but we must be extraordinarily patient `` the assistant secretary said
Economically Martin said the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves
Private business is more effective than government aid he explained because individuals are able to work with the people themselves
The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country at what he termed a `` social cost ``
Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country
The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland 's civil defense more plans for the city 's schools in event of attack
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go and whose advice it should follow
The board members after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. said they thought they had already been cooperating
Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem in case of atomic attack but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go
Dr. Melvin W. Barnes superintendent said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership perhaps on the national level to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful `` and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district
`` Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster `` he said
`` Nobody really expects to evacuate
I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following
Mrs. Molvar who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand `` said `` We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level and it would n't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children ``
Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work ``
Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe 's program
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting
It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done is going to be done and what it thought should be done

Beaverton School District No 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session
A bond issue which would have provided some 3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in January

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God in session at the Memorial Coliseum
The council revised in an effort to strengthen the denomination 's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966
The changes unanimously adopted were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible
The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible
At the adoption the Rev T. F. Zimmerman general superintendent commented `` The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has without compromise stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives ``
New point added
Many changes involved minor editing and clarification
however the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list
The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination now reads
`` The scriptures both Old and New Testament are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man the infallible authoritative rule of faith and conduct ``

Super again elected
Friday afternoon the Rev T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God
His offices are in Springfield Mo
Election came on the nominating ballot
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program `` Breakthrough `` scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years
In his opening address Wednesday the Rev Mr. Zimmerman urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program with `` Breakthrough `` the theme for the first two years
The Rev R. L. Brandt national secretary of the home missions department stressed the need for the first two years work
`` Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church
This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life `` he told delegates Friday
Church loses pace
Talking of the rapid population growth upwards of 12,000 babies born daily with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge ``
`` In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches `` the Rev Mr. Brandt said adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons
`` In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois where we have 200
800 in Southern New England we have 60
we need 100 in Rhode Island we have none `` he said
To step up the denomination 's program the Rev Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years
To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods he said
church meets change
`` The church 's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour ``
A capsule view of proposed plans includes
-- Encouraging by every means all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches
-- Engaging mature experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers
-- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers laymen who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project
-- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches
U.S. Dist Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland 's insurance fraud trial
Denials were of motions of dismissal continuance mistrial separate trial acquittal striking of testimony and directed verdict
In denying motions for dismissal Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are ``
Attorney Dwight L. Schwab in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide
Proof lack charged
Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein 's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied
`` It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy and the mails were then used to carry it out ``
In the afternoon defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case
Miami Fla. March 17
-- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage
Siebern hits homer
Over the first five frames Jack Fisher the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits
Then Dick Hyde submarine-ball hurler entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts
House throws wild
With one down in the eighth Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle
Catcher Frank House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt
Then Heywood Sullivan Kansas City catcher singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A 's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser a wild pitch and Frank Cipriani 's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair 's glove into center
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers
Three were doubles Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one
Bill Kunkel Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth
Hartman purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance and merited the triumph
Keegan a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder gave up the Orioles last two safeties over the final three frames escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally
Robinson doubles again
In the ninth Robinson led off with his second double of the night a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left
Whitey Herzog performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring worked Keegan for a base on balls
Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce
Pete Ward was sent in for House and after failing in a bunt attempt popped to Howser on the grass back of short
John Powell batting for Adair fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches and Buddy Barker up for Stepanovich bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest
The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding along with Robinson the two Birds who got a pair of hits doubled to right center moved to third on Russ Snyder 's single to right and crossed on Kunkel 's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate
The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out
Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally
Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel 's glove and beat it out for a single and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry 's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error
Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners
When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple he was cut down in a close play at third Tuttle to Andy Carey
The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this
Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde 's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center
Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first
It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit
Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play
Breeding to Adair to Gentile setting up Tuttle 's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center
If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon
Miami Fla. March 17
-- The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training program and is ready for belated spring training
Hansen who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a
freshman average completes the Birds spring squad at 49 players
The big 22-year-old shortstop the 1960 American league `` rookie-of-the-year `` flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore signed his contract for an estimated 15,000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds sixth setback in a row
15 pounds lighter
The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring
He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence
When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox Ky. Hansen 's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best `` he said
`` I feel good physically `` Hansen added `` but I think I 'll move better carrying a little less weight than I 'm carrying now ``
Seeks `` improved fielding ``
The rangy Albany Cal native a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz set `` improved fielding `` as his 1961 goal
`` I think I can do a better job with the glove now that I know the hitters around the league a little better `` he said
Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees
Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm the Flock 's veteran knuckleball specialists are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow 's 8 P.M. contest
Duren Sheldon on hill
Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks Auburn N.Y. farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania League are the probable rival pitchers
Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker 22 are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers Art Ditmar in Sunday 's 2 P.M. encounter
Ralph Houk successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games
The famed Yankee Clipper now retired has been assisting as a batting coach
Squad cut near
Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army 's accelerated wintertime military course also at Fort Knox Ky.
The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen
Baltimore 's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit
`` Take a ride on this one `` Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight
It was the first of two doubles by Robinson who was in a mood to celebrate
Just before game time Robinson 's pretty wife Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer
Unfortunately Brooks 's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers
Hansen arrived just before nightfall two hours late in company with Lee MacPhail
J A. W. Iglehart chairman of the Oriole board of directors and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn
Their flight was delayed Dunn said when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane
Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney now catching for the A 's is all for the American League 's 1961 expansion to the West Coast
`` But they shouldda brought in Tokyo too `` added Old Scrapiron
`` Then we 'd really have someplace to go ``

Cleveland March 17 AP
-- George Kerr the swift-striding Jamaican set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight beating Purdue 's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1
Kerr who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3 wiped out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards
Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield
Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race
Then Kerr a graduate student from Illinois moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills 's challenge on the final turn
Mills was timed in 1.10.4
The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games final indoor meet of the season got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run

While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician
St. Petersburg Fla. March 17 AP
-- Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today
Austin Texas
-- A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team 's plays Eldon Moritz ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games
Time stands still every time Moritz a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran goes into the field
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday in fact -- out of football
Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl
That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries
He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State
Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team
But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response `` place-kicker ``
A 208-pound 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking
Last year when he worked out at halfback all season he did n't get into a single game
`` This year coach Royal told me if I 'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me `` said Moritz
`` So I started practicing on it in spring training
Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right kicking leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough
Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and as a result he hopes to start practicing field goals this week
He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School including one that beat Anson 3-0 in a 1953 district game
`` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school `` he said `` and made 26 in a row at one time
I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years ``
Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury
He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee then played 77 minutes in 1956
His statistical record that year when Texas won only one game and lost nine was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards
He went into the Army in March 1957 and returned two years later
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season
Place kicking is largely a matter of timing Moritz declared
`` Once you get the feel of it there 's not much to it
I 've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them ca n't seem to get the feel
Practice helps you to get your timing down
`` It 's kind of like golf -- if you do n't swing a club very often your timing gets off ``
Moritz however kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session
`` If you kick too much your leg gets kinda dead `` he explained
In their first three games the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times or 40 per cent
their total passing yardage in three games 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries
Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games
Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game for four plays he returned the kickoff 30 yards gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench
Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he 'll be ready for Oklahoma
Last week when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference 's top four in rushing he said `` That wo n't last long ``
It did n't
Monday he had four Longhorns in the top four
A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday but attention quickly turned from Saturday 's victory to next week 's problem Rice University
The Mustangs do n't play this week
`` We 're just real happy for the players `` Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy
`` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on
It was the first time we 've been ahead this season when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ``
Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling I think on the part of the coaches and the players
We needed it and we got it ``
Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon
Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game
`` Nelson played magnificent football `` Meek praised
`` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times
And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown
He broke that boy Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff in two and knocked him loose from the football ``
Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons aerial thrusts in the late stages
One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's territory
`` As soon as it started to form Gannon spotted it `` Meek said
`` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback Terry Isaacson had time to turn around
He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss ``
The Air Force 's and the game 's final play was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards
`` He just lay back there and waited for it `` Meek said
`` He almost brought it back all the way ``
Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice
`` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game `` Meek said
`` He 'll be out of action all this week
He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game
There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee ``
Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland
`` He 's looking a lot better and he 's able to run `` Meek explained
`` We 'll let him do a lot of running this week but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play ``
The game players saw the Air Force film Monday ran for 30 minutes then went in while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes
`` We 'll work hard Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday `` Meek said `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday
We 'll work out about an hour on Saturday then we 'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week then taper off ``
SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday Oct. 21
-- Held out of Texas Tech 's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders 38-7 loss to Texas A M Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday Baylor worked out in the rain Monday -- mud or no mud
End Gene Raesz who broke a hand in the Owl 's game with LSU was back working out with Rice Monday and John Nichols sophomore guard moved back into action after a week 's idleness with an ankle injury
The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday -- a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett shaken up in the Tech game would not play against Trinity Saturday
Halfback Bud Priddy slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle joined TCU 's workout Monday
The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short one
The Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again and it looks as if coach Hank Stram 's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings
Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of quarterbacks apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb
Rabb the former Louisiana State field general came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers defending league champions
`` Just our luck ``
Exclaimed Stram
`` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ``
Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star Jack Spikes though he did the team 's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury
`` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well `` said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game
`` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job ``
The Texans won the game through ball control with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes
`` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack `` explained Stram
`` They can be going along doing little damage then bang bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble ``
The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off
The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes the flashy halfback
He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards
The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver 's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson the speedy halfback hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas
A quick touchdown resulted
`` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away `` said Stram quipping `` I think I 'll put that play in the book ``
The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas Arkansas and Texas A M -- made a big dent in the statistics last week
Texas 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards 1,065 rushing and 447 passing a new SWC high
Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing on 5 completions in 7 tosses and a tough defense to whip TCU and A M with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950
Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards
Texas leads in per-game rushing averages 355 yards and passing 149 to Baylor 's 126 but idle Baylor has the best defensive record 187.5 yards per game to Texas 189
A M has the best defense against passes 34.7 yards per game
Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use the major leagues have ordered their own tests which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis 5-3
The husky 6-3 205-pound lefthander was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area
It was Nischwitz third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies winning streak to four straight
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings an unusual characteristic for a southpaw
The Bears took the lead in the first inning as they did in Sunday 's opener and never lagged
Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear 's attack
After Al Paschal gruonded out Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe
Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left
Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert 's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout
The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer 's glove
Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth
Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines infield roller accounted for the tallies
The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik 's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth
Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play
Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik 's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base
Bingles and bobbles
Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe 's eight hits
It was the season 's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order
The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark
Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ
Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage
Lefty Wyman Carey another Denver rookie will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night
Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn
Dallas Tex May 1 -- AP
-- Kenny Lane of Muskegon Mich. world 's seventh ranked lightweight had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler Tex here Monday night
St. Paul-Minneapolis May 1 -- AP
-- Billy Gardner 's line double which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday
Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game a liner to center
He came all the way around on Gardner 's hit before 5777 fans
It was Gardner 's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year
Turk Lown was tagged with the loss his second against no victories while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss
The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green 's double to left
The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly
Jim Landis 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard
Al Smith 's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and Carreon 's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front
A double by Green Allison 's run-scoring 2-baser an infield single by Lemon and Gardner 's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth
Ogden Utah May 1 -- AP
-- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball
`` I 've had it `` he told a newsman
`` I know when my reflexes are gone and I 'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club ``
This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout
Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games
He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno Nev. where his wife former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen awaited
She said when she learned Jackie was heading home `` I 'm just speculating but I have to think Jack feels he 's hurting Boston 's chances ``
The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner City of San Francisco stopped in Ogden Utah for a few minutes
Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him
The conductor said to Ritchie `` I do n't think you want to talk to him
You 'll probably get a ball bat on the head
He 's mad at the world ``
But Jackie had gone into the station
Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand
`` I told him who I was and he was quite cold
But he warmed up after a while
I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he Liston got was through a keyhole
He said he had never talked to Liston ``
Liston is Bill Liston baseball writer for the Boston Traveler who quoted Jensen as saying
`` I ca n't hit anymore
I ca n't run
I ca n't throw
Suddenly my reflexes are gone
Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging
And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday
Both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts
It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked `` Wish I was 40 and a top-grade big leaguer
The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game 's history
Yes with Bob Grove Carl Hubbell Herb Pennock Art Nehf Vernon Gomez et al
Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow a ball player 's ball player as they say in the trade
I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 1951 before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792
`` Spahnie does n't know how to merely go through the motions `` remarked Enos Slaughter another all-out guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse
The spectacular Mays who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings
Incidentally only two did it before a home audience
Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn 's Ebbetts Field
Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies the Braves Joe Adcock Lou Gehrig of the Yankees Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito then with Cleveland made their history on the road
Willie 's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle
This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether you 're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee
The record books however would favor the Giants ace
In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases
Once the figure was 30-30
Willie 's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey 's
The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park
It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump
The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home
This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers
The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club `` when games were cut off
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy
This year I am told the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here
There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise
It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level
You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy
This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game
Cincinnati Ohio AP
-- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale
With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers the most ever used by one team in a series game
Johnny Blanchard Mantle 's replacement slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning
Hector Lopez subbing for Berra smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth
The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors
The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud
In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about 400 feet away with two men on
Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game trailing only 6-3 but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out
In the fifth Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really did n't matter
The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager
Only Bucky Harris the `` boy-manager `` of Washington in 1924 and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat
Philadelphia Jan. 23
-- Nick Skorich the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles was elevated today to head coach
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between 20,000 and 25,000 a year
He succeeds Buck Shaw who retired at the end of last season
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer
Williams is a defensive coach
Gauer works with the ends
Choice was expected
The selection had been expected
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings the newest National Football League entry
Van Brocklin the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player
With Skorich at the helm the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing
In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin 's aerials
Skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing
Coach played 3 years
Skorich who is 39 years old played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers
An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season
He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949
He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy N. Y.
He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach
Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers
The Eagles signed him for Shaw 's staff in 1959
Skorich began his new job auspiciously today
At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth the Eagles were honored for winning the championship
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football
With the announcement of a `` special achievement award `` to William A Bill Shea the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter Baseball Writers Association of America at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel

Show follows ceremonies
A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit dance and song
The 53-year-old Shea a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York
Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume Shea worked relentlessly
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city
The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees
Despite countless barriers and disappointments Shea moved forward
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion he sought to convince another National League club to move here
When that failed he enlisted Branch Rickey 's aid in the formation of a third major league the Continental with New York as the key franchise
The Continental League never got off the ground but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand
Flushing stadium in works
The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson

Golf 's golden boy
Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months
He won the Masters the United States Open and a record 80,738 in prize money
He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year `` by Sports Illustrated and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year `` a distinction that earned for him the 10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt
But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot
A couple of weeks ago he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole
It made him human
And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair
If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all
It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold
He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all
The world 's best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher
He boomed a 280-yard drive
Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance
No margin for error
On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole Arnold whipped into his second shot
The ball went off in a majestic arc an out-of-bounds slice
He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side
`` It is possible that I over-corrected `` he said ruefully
Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes
So he wound up with a dozen
`` It was a nice round figure that 12 `` he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed
From the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open
The idol of the hackers of course is Ray Ainsley who achieved a 19 in the United States Open
Their secondary hero is another pro Willie Chisholm who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully
Willie 's partner was Long Jim Barnes who tried to keep count
Stickler for rules
`` How many is that Jim ``
Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project
`` Thirteen `` said Long Jim
`` Nae man `` said Willie `` ye must be countin the echoes ``
He had a 16
Palmer 's dozen were honestly earned
Nor were there any rules to save him
If there had been he would have found a loophole because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book
This knowledge has come in handy too
His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway
The ball floated downstream
A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie
Arnold sent for Joe Dey the executive secretary of the golf association
Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream
`` I knew it all along `` confessed Arnold with a grin `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there ``
For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors
He 'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he 's right
That 's how he first won the Masters in 1958
It happened on the twelfth hole a 155-yarder
Arnold 's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local rules into force
Ruling from on high
`` I can remove the ball ca n't I ``
Asked Palmer of an official
`` No `` said the official
`` You must play it where it lies ``
`` You 're wrong `` said Arnold a man who knows the rules
`` I 'll do as you say but I 'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling ``
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball a 3 with the provisional one
The golfing fathers ruled in his favor
So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke
Until a few weeks ago however Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today
Other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through Saturday concern television rules changes professional football 's hall of fame players benefits and constitutional amendments
The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division plus two games against teams in the other division
However this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks
Pete Rozelle the league commissioner pointed out
`` We 'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other ``
Nine of the league 's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates
If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies they wo n't be misled by the Pirates slower start this season
`` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat `` Mauch said here the other day
`` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year
They have the same men no age problem no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season along with Bobby Shantz ``
Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 breaking even with them will get their first 1961 shot at baseball 's world champions
The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9
Change in pitchers
Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio for several reasons 1 Broglio 's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago
2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible
3 The Redbirds disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday
Manager Hemus eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment
After Thursday 's open date Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night
Harvey Haddix set back by the flu this season will start against his former Cardinal mates who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight 's game at Busch Stadium
Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck
Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960
Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he had n't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday 's game
Mizell has won both of his starts
Nieman kept in lineup
After a lengthy workout yesterday an open date Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup
That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants
`` I have to stay with Nieman for a while `` Hemus said
`` Bill White sore ankles should be ready
With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh I may use Don Taussig in center ``
`` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes and he looked good `` Hemus said
`` He should be getting back in the groove before long
Our pitching is much better than it has shown ``
The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday
Six Bucks over
Until the Bucs bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend the champions had eight men hitting over
Despite the recession Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages Smoky Burgess Gino Cimoli Bill Virdon Bob Clemente and Dick Groat each
Dick Stuart Don Hoak
and Bob Skinner
Bill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feet
Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs
Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but is n't likely to see action here this week
`` We 're getting Friend some runs for a change and he has been pitching good `` Murtaugh said
`` Virdon has been blasting the ball
No plunkers for him ``
Six Bucs over
The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season
On last May 1 the Cardinals stood at 7-6 ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone
In 1958 the Birds were 3-10 on May 1
A year later they were 4-13
Since 1949 the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four times
The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories
The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs the club 's top since 1949
Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories
Since 1949 the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team
Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8
The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York 's '51 Giants who dropped 11 of their first 13
They honored the battling Billikens last night
Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who in the words of Coach John Benington `` had more confidence in themselves than I did ``
The most valuable player award was split three ways among Glen Mankowski Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer
In addition a special award was given to Bob Bevo Nordmann the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury
`` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing `` Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies `` but what this team had was a little different
The boys had a tremendous respect for each other 's ability
They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do
`` Several times I found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk
We 'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say Do n't worry Coach -- we 'll get 'em all right ``
The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg sports editor of the Post-Dispatch
Kieffer the only junior in the group was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch as well as his all-round excellent play
Mankowski the ball-hawking defensive expert was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U 's nationally televised victory
Benington said `` I 've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day ``
Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills
After the coach listed all the boy 's faults Hartweger said `` Coach before I leave here you 'll get to like me ``
Mrs. Benington admired Gordon 's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team
As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl he said `` I want to thank coach 's wife for talking him into letting me play ``
Bob Burnes sports editor of the Globe-Democrat presented Bob Nordmann with his award
Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time
Within a week after the injury suffered in St. Louis 's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament Nordmann was sitting on the Bill 's bench doing what he could to help Benington
On the clock given him was the inscription `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball 1960-61 ``
Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were Art Hambric Donnell Reid Bill Nordmann Dave Harris Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich
`` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future `` Benington pointed out
`` By winning against Bradley Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams home courts they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it does n't take a super team to do it ``
St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game
Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game said to be the first in Billiken baseball history as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College 5-1 at Crystal City
The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie
The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday
Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple
St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field
The game opened a busy week for Washington
The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy Ill. Saturday
If it 's true that contented cows give more milk why should n't happy ball players produce more base hits
The two top talents of the time Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which to be frank about it never have quite reached expectations
And that 's meant as a boost not a knock
Mays and Mantle both 10-year men at 30 have so much ability that baseball men agree they 've never hit the heights
Their heights that is
Mantle the bull-necked blond switch-hitter had one sensational triple-crown season 1959 when he batted and also led the American League in home runs 52 and rbi 's 130
Like the Yankees slugger Mays the terror of the Giants has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players but not by -- or for -- Willie
His best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs drove in 127 and stole 24 bases
Now apparently happier under new managers Mays and Mantle the perfect players are behaving as though they 're going to pass those previous peaks
Yes we know they 're professionals men paid to play and they should n't care how they 're handled just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month
The truth is though that men react differently to different treatment
For that matter Stan Musial is rare possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers reserving his opinions but not his effort
Mantle it 's apparent resented Casey Stengel 's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility
The old man was almost too possessive
Stengel inherited DiMaggio Rizzuto but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors from Joplin to New York
With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him Ol Case wanted No 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter but also the best bunter base-runner and outfielder
Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats
Inheriting a more mature Mantle who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway Ralph Houk quietly bestowed no pun intended the mantle of authority on Mickey
The Major decided that rather than be led the slugger could lead
And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far
The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles Wrigley Field Jr. Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books Babe Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927
Four for Alvin
Mays day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year
Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark
Next to Leo Durocher Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army 's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St.
The pert gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo N.Y. is a `` civilian `` with the Army
Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director
The job also covers a number of other items
`` Mom `` Marr as the more than 80 men at the center call her is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society
Her day starts early but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written and during May which is National Salvation Army Week there are plenty schedules to be made or problems to be solved Mrs. Marr 's office is always open and the welcome mat is out
Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures
`` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men `` Mrs. Marr explained
The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center
`` And I bum tickets to everything I can `` she said
`` I 've become the greatest beggar in the world ``
In addition to the tickets to the movies sporting events and concerts Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system
Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother `` watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society
By mid-June millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land
In another four weeks with schools closed across the nation the great all-American summer safari will be under way
By July 1 six weeks from now motel-keepers all over the nation will by 6 p.m. be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign `` No Vacancy ``
No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car throw suitcases kids and comic books in the back seat and head for home
And where is `` home `` that magic place of the heart
Ah that is simple
Home is where a man was born reared went to school and most particularly where grandma is
That is where we turn in the good old summertime
The land lies ready for the coming onslaught
My husband and I a month ahead of the rush have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson Ariz. to New York City
set for influx
I can testify that motels service and comfort stations they go together like Scots and heather dog wagons roadside restaurants souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting
I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent far-flung over-night accommodations
Maybe motel-keeping is n't the nation 's biggest industry but it certainly looks that way from the highway
There are motels for all purposes and all tastes
There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock Tex as I discovered
There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities vented heat air conditioned carpeted free TV storm cellar ``
Many with pools
Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools `` swim at your own risk `` is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools
Some even boast two pools one for adults and one for children
But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar
Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated `` signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday
The current monthly payroll comes to about 15,000,000
Howard E. Simpson the railroad 's president said `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action ``
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B O. operates
Salary cut and lay-offs
It will be accomplished in two ways 1
A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class
Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense
Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough a B O. spokesman said
Those union members kept on their jobs therefore will not take a cut in their wages
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job

Annapolis Jan. 7
-- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what
The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams Jr. a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent argued for about fifteen minutes at this week 's meeting
The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting
Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins 's conversation and how they were written up for the board 's approval
`` I hate to have these things come up again and again `` Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion
`` These are the board 's minutes
I 'll write what you tell me to ``
For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago
It was about that time a board member said later that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen Jr. State superintendent of schools told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him
The Board of County Commissioners the Sanitary Commission the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings
Dr. Jenkins notes however that most of the school boards in the State do not do so
State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli D. First Baltimore had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt Street

Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt Street
He called Vincent L. Piraro proprietor of the shop who summoned police and an ambulance
The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies `` in the city 's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible
Councilman William D. Schaefer D. Fifth said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month
Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December
Equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall `` Mr. Schaefer said
The Councilman who is the Administration floor leader also criticized Bernard L. Werner public works director for `` halting snow operations `` on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm
Sent home for rest
Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week
What he did Mr. Werner said was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest
Work resumed Wednesday he said
Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them should be `` strictly enforced ``
Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive ``
Recounting personal observations of clearance work the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes
Annapolis Jan. 7 special

The victims were H. Malone Dresbach 47 and his wife Shirley 46
Each had been shot in the back several times with a
automatic rifle according to Capt Elmer Hagner chief of Anne Arundel detectives
Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail
The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court
Younger son calls police
Soon after 10 A.M. when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section 15 miles south of here on the bay in response to a call from the Dresbach 's other son Lee 14 they found Mrs. Dresbach 's body on the first-floor bedroom floor
Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor police said
The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother 's car
The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio
Two brothers adopted
Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs
Trooper J A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car with three boys at a Route 2 service station just outside Annapolis
The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station police said

The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to 634,517,000 a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year
A breakdown of the ten-month total showed
Nonresidential at 253,355,000 up 22 per cent
residential at 278,877,000 up 12 per cent
and heavy engineering at 102,285,000 down 33 per cent
Residential building consists of houses apartments hotels dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter
The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments which began about six years ago has more than tripled within that span of time
In 1961 it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field
Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments Leo J. Pantas vice president of a hardware manufacturing company pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house
Convenience held key
`` Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today
Trouble-free long-life quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 `` Pantas predicted
Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section
Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units in two-story and three-story structures
Various of the apartments are of the terrace type being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct
Others which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs have balconies
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction
Heating is by individual gas-fired forced warm air systems
Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation
London Feb. 9
-- Vital secrets of Britain 's first atomic submarine the Dreadnought and by implication of the entire United States navy 's still-building nuclear sub fleet were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring secret service agents testified today
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year
It is a killer sub -- that is a hunter of enemy subs
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy 's Nautilus the world 's first atomic submarine
Its power unit however was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack
Five held for trial
The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing
A full trial was ordered for
Two British civil servants Miss Ethel Gee 46 and her newly devoted friend Harry Houghton 55 and divorced
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard
Gordon A. Lonsdale 37 a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport
When arrested he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping it was testified
Flashed to Moscow
A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger bookseller and wife Joyce
In Washington the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen an American couple formerly of New York City
In their suburban cottage the crown charges the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man usually on the first Saturday evening of each month and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books
Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing a printed page or a manuscript
All five pleaded innocent
Only Miss Gee asked for bail
Her young British lawyer James Dunlop pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother 80 her maiden aunt also 80 and bedridden for 20 years and her uncle 76 who once ran a candy shop
Refuses to grant bail
`` I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them `` said the magistrate K.J.P Baraclough
The trial will be held probably the first week of March in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s was sentenced to 14 years in prison
Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five who may have altered history in the 1960s
Fuchs after nine and a half years was released being given time off for good behavior
He promptly went to communist East Germany
The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five 29,000 in American and British currency mostly 20 bills and in British government bonds and stocks
`` This is Russian money `` said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general 's office
He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow Lonsdale the Red paymaster and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country 's secrets
`` Of highest value ``
The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought and thereby of the American undersea fleet were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier
But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy 's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare Capt George Symonds
He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon Jan. 7
The information he said would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy
Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring watched for six months was broken remained untold
The British defending lawyers who today increased from three to four demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury the chances of their clients would improve
So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour
Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet
Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed
The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack
With the machinery went a complete design for the hull
The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it
Navy 's future involved
`` Much of the navy 's future depends upon her `` an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack 's first arrival in British waters in August 1959 for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station
It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work
`` Her basic hull form a teardrop and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines including the potent Polaris missile submarines `` the statement went on
The atom reactor water cooled was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp.
Thru development the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size and also in complexity allowing a single propeller to be used the navy said
The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work
It was first tried out on a conventional submarine the Albacore in 1954
The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built
Reputedly it could outrun underwater the fastest destroyers
It could reputedly go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month
It was of the hunter-killer type designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes
The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee 's purse would if completed and handed back have given the Kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future ``
Interested in detector
The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC the underwater equipment for detecting submarines it was testified
Range was a vital detail
Designs of parts were sought
Six radiomen told how twice on two days after the ring was nabbed a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling using signals times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale 's apartment and the Krogers house and also fastened to the transmitter lid
Oddly the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested
The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor combined with malice and individual enmity `` on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court
The three -- Miles J. Cooperman Sheldon Teller and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws
In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men Bernard H. Sokol attorney for the detectives said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent ``
had to know peddlers
`` When they became members of the city police narcotics unit `` Sokol said `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket
They on occasion posed as addicts and peddlers ``
Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together Sokol continued rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals ``
This he added brought about `` petty jealousies `` and `` petty personal grievances ``
`` In the same five year period that the United States says they the detectives were engaged in this conspiracy `` Sokol continued `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor 's medal ``
No comments by U.S
In opening D. Arthur Connelly assistant United States attorney read the indictment but made no comments
Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients guilt
Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling 4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler Otis Sears 45 of 6934 Indiana Av
Among other acts Teller and Austin are accused of paying 800 to Sears
The first witness Moses Winston Mardis 5835 Michigan Av a real estate agent and former bail bondsman took the stand after opening statements had been made
But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings two of the defendants and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted
Buaford Robinson 23 of 7026 Stewart Av a CTA bus driver was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st Street and South Park Way
Robinson was treated at a physician 's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee
His losses included his money bag containing 40 to 50 and his 214 paycheck
Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash Avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High School 30th Street and South Park Way and began `` skylarking ``
When 51st Street was reached Robinson related he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor
As he left the bus with his money bag Robinson added the largest youth accosted him a quarrel ensued and the youth knocked him down
Then the youths fled with his money
Mrs. Blanche Dunkel 60 who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law Ervin Lang then 28 appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier
She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison but former Gov Stratton commuted her term to 75 years making her eligible for parole as one of his last acts in office
Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934
It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place
The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined 100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20
The defendant William L. Stickney 3 23 of 3211 Park pl Evanston who pleaded guilty to reckless driving also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month
Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing Inc. 2544 Green Bay Rd Evanston a food brokerage and grocery chain firm of which his father William L. Jr. is president
Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart Avenue at Central Street

The car spun around again Simms said before Stickney could turn north in Prairie Avenue and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie
St. Johns Mich. April 19
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion
He returned to his cell in the county jail where he has been held since his arrest last July without a word to his court-appointed attorney Jack Walker or his guard
The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman 's stepson Vincent Hengesbach 54 who was tried for the same crime in December 1958 and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 1958
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since
When the verdict came in against his young neighbor Hengesbach said
`` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed
Still I do n't wish to appear happy at somebody else 's misfortune ``
Lives on welfare
Hengesbach who has been living on welfare recently said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia 27 miles southwest of here
Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958
Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police
He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach
However the confession which was the only evidence against him was retracted before the trial
Charges in doubt
Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl
Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing
Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation
Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure
Locked in motel
A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation
The jury which was locked up in a motel overnight was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced
The jury foreman Mrs. Olive Heideman of rural Elsie said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence
She said the jurors agreed that Pohl 's confession was valid
The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter
The verdict came three hours later
Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read
The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week
A Sterling Township family of six surviving children whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends
While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother 's duties fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski family 34220 Viceroy
Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski 42 died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother Mrs. Mary Pankowski in the adjoining suburb of Warren
Funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter Christine 11 who died of burns at the same hospital Monday have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in St. Anne 's Catholic Church 31978 Mound in Warren
The mother and daughter who will be buried side by side in Mt Olivet Cemetery rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home 31730 Mound Warren
Mrs. Pankowski 61 remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion which occurred while Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother 's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile Road East
Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother because the flat lacked electricity
Christine 's twin sister Patricia and Darlene Kowalski 8 escaped with minor burns
They are home now with the other Kowalski children Vicky 14
Dennis 6
Eleanor 2
and Bernardine 1
`` All we have left in the world is one another and we must stay together the way Mother wanted `` Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother 's death yesterday afternoon
Kowalski a roofer who seldom worked last winter already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills
Neighbor women such as Mrs. Sidney Baker 2269 Serra Sterling Township have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski 's sister-in-law Mrs. Anna Kowalski 22111 David East Detroit
Another neighbor Mrs. Frank C. Smith 2731 Pall Mall Sterling Township surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with 135 collected locally toward the 400 funeral costs
John C. Houghton president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family
Students help out
Houghton said 6 p.m. Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile Road East
He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553 Warren Village Station
Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost 25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School 5155 Fourteen Mile road east
Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today and revealed that Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski
Funds from dances
Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago and another dance for Fuhrmann 's 770 students this Friday night
`` Furhmann 's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort started largely among the students themselves because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family Pohly said
There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School 3505o Dequindre which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine
Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday
But today he wanted to make a public statement
`` I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family
I was n't sure there were such people anywhere in the world
I 'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them ``
An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist
Patrolman George Kimmell of McClellan Station said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk 9230 Vernor east a third grader at the Scripps School for his assistance in the case
Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk
Gets car number
Kimmell ordered the driver to back up watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly `` took off at high speed `` he said narrowly missing him
Commandeering a passing car Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle but lost it in traffic
Returning to the school crossing the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver a neighbor and had obtained the license number
The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees 17 of 2433 McClellan currently on probation and under court order not to drive
Given 15 days
He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T. Murphy who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction
The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June
The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today
Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire
In Vientiane the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its `` friends and neighbors `` for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom
Britain 's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home
He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire
A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 he said
Plea for arms
The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana
He indicated that requests would be made for more U.S. arms and more U.S. military advisers
He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens
One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body
A note making the request was handed to U.S Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown
The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam
The minister describing the attacks which led up to the appeal said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near Thakhek in southern-central Laos
There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources
In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated
Havana April 19
-- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators
A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair
The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar Del Rio where the executions took place
Arms plot charged
The broadcast said Anderson a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman and McNair of Miami were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels
Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro 's regime
Anderson 's wife and four children live in Miami
McNair 25 was seized March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in Pinar Del Rio about 35 miles from Havana
Report others held
At least 20 other Americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup
Among them were a number of newsmen including Henry Raymont of United Press International and Robert Berrellez of Associated Press
So many Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails
More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested -- 100 of them Roman Catholic priests
Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state few emerge in the West to tell about it
M. Kegham -- the name is a pseudynom -- was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ARF -- two reasons the Communists put him away when they arrived in 1945
Today M. Kegham was in Detroit en route to join his wife and children in California
Emory University 's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state 's tax laws made such a step possible
`` Emory University 's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race `` board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated
But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes
The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated
`` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning of true university grade and meet its financial obligations without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions `` the statement said
The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation
An Emory spokesman indicated however that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws
The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if among other criteria `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people ``
At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state
Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church
Some church leaders both clerical and lay have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation
Urged in 1954
The student newspaper The Emory Wheel as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation
`` From its beginning `` the trustees statement said Friday `` Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning
Teaching research and study according to highest standards under Christian influence are paramount in the Emory University policy
`` As a private institution supported by generous individuals Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education
`` There is not now nor has there ever been in Emory University 's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race color or creed
Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students and others seeking applications from prospective students and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university irrespective of race color or creed
`` On the other hand Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia
`` When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race color or creed continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education ``
A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street NE police said
The dead youth was identified as Robert E. Sims 19 of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir Aj
Patrolman G. E. Hammons said the car evidently slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the pole
The other occupants were James Willard Olvey 18 of 963 Ponce De Leon Ave. NE and Larry Coleman Barnett 19 of 704 Hill St. SE both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises
The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins `` if negotiations failed
The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights
intend to attend
`` We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year `` the identically worded letters said
The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start of negotiations
They indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate
Downtown and art theater managers and owners contacted Friday night for comment on the COAHR request said they had no knowledge of such a letter and that it was not in the Friday mail
However three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend
The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday
Several theater operators said however that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair
Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago
Charles A Black COAHR chairman said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up
He declined to name the three
Friday 's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting
Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend the letters said would be considered a `` sign of indifference ``
Black said COAHR `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal ``
A prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that `` extensive research by COAHR into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits ``
Besides managers of downtown theaters the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead

Georgia 's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading pest
The department is planning to expand its eradication program soon to four additional counties -- Troup Pierce Bryan and Bulloch -- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants according to W. E. Blasingame state entomologist
Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical heptachlor over 30,000 acres in Troup 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties
The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and Jones counties over 37,679 acres
The department has just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon
Also being treated are Houston Bleckley Tift Turner and Dodge counties Blasingame said
The fire ant is thought to infest approximately two million acres of land in Georgia attacking crops young wildlife and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic to its venom Blasingame said
The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week
This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway
Students have been using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study
Perhaps the engineers can find out what causes all the congestion and suggest methods to eliminate it
Incidentally 14th Street and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight hours
It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue NE
the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways and Jones Avenue and Marietta Street Aj

Salem special
-- For a second month in a row Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month 's need the state public welfare commission was told Friday
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary
William Smythe director of field service told the commissioners that Multnomah as of Aug. 22 had spent 58,918 out of its budgeted 66,000 in the category leaving only 7,082 for the rest of the month
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month this could mean a shortage of as high as 17,000
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month Smythe said
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received however

The commission meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners Roy Webster of Hood River and Dr. Ennis Keizer of North Bend approved a year 's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past
The contract with Ray Field who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape would renew his present salary of 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes
Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field 's unique position and knowledge in the program the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period
But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past ``
He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave ``
Salary termed modest
Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government
He also said that the salary in terms of going rates in the field was `` modest `` in terms of the man 's responsibility
The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed he said and added Field 's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program
`` Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract ``
Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck representative from Multnomah County of the commission chairman Joseph E. Harvey Jr.
`` My feeling at the moment `` he said `` is that we have no alternative irrespective of some of the arguments about him
The continued operation of this program depends on having his service ``
Mrs. Peck later joined by the commission 's vice-chairman Mrs. Lee Patterson took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday
A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service of which Harvey is president quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem instead of `` crippling `` the agency had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses with the key being improved communications between F A and the commission staff
`` I rather resent `` she said `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this
I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people
The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles ``
Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare ``

Birmingham Ala. -- AP
-- The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the `` Freedom Rider `` bus burning trial four weeks ago
U.S. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury
He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker 59 a farmer of Hartselle Ala.
Eight men were tried together in U.S. District Court in Anniston Ala. on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob 's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders
The bus was burned outside Anniston
One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal
A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict
The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case
The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts
He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case
Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial
Neither was seated on the jury
Then when the case went to the jury the judge excused one of the jurors saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened
The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient
The judge replaced the juror with an alternate
No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents
At the opening of the trial the jury panel was questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections
One member of the panel -- not Mr. Parker -- indicated he had been a member of the KKK at one time
He was not seated on the jury
The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a maximum penalty of 2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction

Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom `` are endangering crops and wildlife Carl W. Buchheister president of the National Audubon Society said today
`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play `` he commented
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target the fire ant
`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop `` he said
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming
There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training he added
`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries `` Buchheister told the delegates
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill creation of national seashore parks including Point Reyes
preservation of the wetlands where birds breed
a pesticides co-ordination act
stronger water pollution control programs and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil
The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society

Seventeen years ago today German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber
The World War 2 German bomber rolled down a runway and took off
The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip
This had never been done before
Now a quiet-spoken middle-aged man Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed 's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale where he played a key role in the development of the Navy 's Polaris missile
He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944
`` The first two pilots had crashed `` he said
`` I had developed the machines and therefore knew them
It was time to go up myself ``
Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler 's super-secret `` Reichenberg project `` which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war
About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead
The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe
The success of the project depended upon Fiedler 's flight
Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket 's automatic guidance mechanism the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude
At 12,000 feet Fiedler signaled `` release `` and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel
To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h
It was probably man 's first successful flight in a missile
`` She flew beautifully `` said Fiedler
`` There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow
I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip ``
Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket 's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage
He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield
Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed
Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles
The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb
Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water striking below the waterline of individual ships
A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers but the project was halted before the end of the war and the missiles later fell into Allied hands
Now a family man with three children Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale
His spare time is spent in soaring gliders
`` It 's so quiet `` he said `` so slow serene -- and so challenging ``

Dr. Albert Schweitzer world-famous theologian and medical missionary has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale
Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service a Quaker organization will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p.m. Saturday
In a letter to the American Friends Service Dr. Schweitzer wrote
`` Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out
`` They can not do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack
The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons
otherwise no peace is possible
`` Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency ``
A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein 47 who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant `` and operator of a janitors service
Before he testified for 20 minutes Stein who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr. admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums
Glimco a buddy
Among his gangland buddies he said were Joseph Joey Glimco a mob labor racketeer and four gang gambling chiefs Gus Slim Alex Ralph Pierce Joe Caesar DiVarco and Jimmy Monk Allegretti
Another hoodlum Louis Arger drew 39,000 from Stein 's janitor firm the National Maintenance company in three years ending in 1959 Stein disclosed in an interview
`` I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier `` Stein said
`` But Arger never was able to produce it so I cut him off my payroll ``
Connection is sought
Other witnesses after appearances before the jury which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters including Glimco and Alex
The federal lawyers according to their witnesses also were tracing Stein 's fees as a labor consultant
Under scrutiny two of the witnesses said were payments and loans to Stein 's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St.
The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories liquor firms and other businesses
Lee a witness
Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee director of McCormick Place
Jerome Leavitt a partner in the Union Liquor company 3247 S. Kedzie Av Dominic Senese a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo onetime gang chief
and Frank W. Pesce operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm the Best Sanitation and Supply company 1215 Blue Island Av
Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place
Stein 's fee Lee said was 10 per cent of the janitors pay
Stein estimated this amount at `` about 1,500 or 1,600 a month ``
A 12,500 payment
Leavitt as he entered the jury room said he was prepared to answer questions about the 12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for `` labor consultant work `` with five unions which organized Leavitt 's workers
Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman 's local the teamsters union a salesman 's union the janitors union and a bottling workers union
Government attorneys Leavitt said have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans `` totaling about 40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year
All of the loans in amounts up to 5,000 each have been repaid by Stein according to Leavitt
Stein said he needed the money Leavitt said to `` meet the payroll `` at National Maintenance company
The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco 's discredited taxi drivers union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av
The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday

The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week
A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation
Curtis Allen Huff 41 of 1630 Lake Av Wilmette was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association 1 S. Dearborn St. where he formerly was employed as an attorney
Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total 20,000 altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately 10,000
Lien payments involved
Huff 's attorney Antone F. Gregorio quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff as attorney for the loan association in satisfaction of mechanic 's liens on property on which the association held mortgages
Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living ``
Huff who received a salary of 109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year said that his private practice was not lucrative
Huff lives with his wife Sue and their four children 6 to 10 years old in a 25,000 home with a 17,000 mortgage
Charge lists 3 checks
The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber an attorney for the association
The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18
On that date according to Gregorio Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av
There Gregorio said Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense
Later Huff cashed three checks for 100 each at the Sherman House using a credit card
All bounced
When Huff attempted to cash another 100 check there Monday hotel officials called police

Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week
For many reasons the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many
In fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than 100 shares
Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares for all of their customers
A measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of 12.50 a share
The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler Guerin Turner the managing underwriter was at 17 a share
And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around 22 a share
But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market
Indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up
Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold 185,000 to the public at 12.50 with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at 11.50 a share
There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering
`` We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas
Cable confirmation `` it said translated
But E.G.T could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares
After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone
But the result of it all was E.G.T partner Dean Guerin believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation
`` I feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list `` he said meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country
He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do
But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one
The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances
First the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up
As a result it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend
Second the `` potato chip industry `` has caught the fancy of investors lately and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market
Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up
And third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth `` industry in the public mind of late
Foods which long had been considered `` recession resistant `` but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going to higher price-earnings ratios
The potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger
The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today 's successful companies got started during the deep depression days
Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest
But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms
So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito
All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is
Now if Morton 's newest product a corn chip known as Chip-o 's turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to
Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued in the millions of dollars
More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at Sherman
It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner 's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history
The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars
It weighs in the tons so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year
A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of 250,000 and it 's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U.S. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area
The Murray Co. of Texas Inc. originated in Dallas in 1896
They 've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900 's
More than 700 employees make gin machinery that 's sold anywhere cotton is grown
Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firm
The Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899
The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834
Headquarters is in Birmingham Ala.
Factories are located here and in Prattville Ala.
About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employes
The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world
Hardwicke-Etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment
The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co.
They export also
The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies
In 1930 they began making cotton processing equipment
Presently Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people depending on the season of the year
The Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912
Factory operations are in Columbus Ga.
The district office here employs about 65
The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here
The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system which turns out a complete ginning system began operations in 1959
Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock
The John E. Mitchell Co. began work in Dallas in 1928
The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton driers and heaters and they lay claim to being the first maker 1910 of boil extraction equipment
The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation
Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people
They export cotton ginning machinery
The Hinckley Gin Supply Co. is a maker of `` overhead equipment ``
This includes driers cleaners burr extractors separators and piping that 's located above gin stands in a complete gin
The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt including the Mississippi Delta
The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co. has home offices and factory facilities here
They make gin saws and deal in parts supplies and some used gin machinery
The Stacy Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas
They 've been in Dallas since 1921
Cotton Belt Gin Service Inc. of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago
They distribute equipment in 11 states
The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting bearings etc
Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy
New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year
Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year
Totaling 3,399 sales jumped 14 per cent over February 's 2,963
However compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441 this March was off 23 per cent
On a quarter-to-quarter comparison the first quarter of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year 's 3-month total of 11,744
This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the U.S. for first three months of 1961 were about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier
With the March pickup dealers are optimistic that the April-June quarter will equal or top last year
The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter
On the local level compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars
Only three standard models -- Buick Chrysler and Mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in March sales in the county

The Kennedy administration 's new housing and urban renewal proposals particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration came under fire in Dallas last week
The Administration 's proposals complex and sweeping as they are all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core stated Caron S. Stallard first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America
-- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn `` Beryl W. Sprinkel economist of Harris Trust Savings Bank Chicago predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn California group conference
Another speaker William H. Draper Jr. former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper Gaither Anderson urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more ``
He urged support for President Kennedy 's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations
not flash in pan
Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan `` but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern
`` In view of the current expansion which promises to be substantial `` he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 ``
Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence ``
Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth `` he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery ``
He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation ``
The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 ``
The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike
Draper declared `` As I see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today
We must justify our heritage
We must be ready for any needed sacrifice ``
He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration that `` Russia respects our show of strength but that presently we 're not acting as we should and must ``
He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war `` you ca n't buy yourself out and that 's what we 're trying to do ``
While he declined to suggest how he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro `` for unless we do we 're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere
Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I do n't believe we can permit that ``
New York AP
-- Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery erasing all of Monday 's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks
Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level `` represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average
It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages
Some good news
Although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news
A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month
Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8 next year paving the way for lower taxes
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87
Of 1,253 issues traded 695 advanced and 354 declined
New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14
Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day
Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday
A 25 billion advertising budget in an 800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson head of one of the world 's greatest camera firms in a key address before the American Marketing Assn
However Peterson president of Bell Howell warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom ``
`` As we look to the 800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40 in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed `` Peterson said
`` With this kind of new product log-jam the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically ``
The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs
Nothing to fear
Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas
He cited as an example how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs by improving its production know-how and technology
He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market

Union Oil Co. of California Tuesday offered 120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon Read Co. to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp.
Gulf 's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash according to Union
Under the new offering only 60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares
Due in 1986
The new offering Tuesday consisted of 60 million worth of 4-7/8 debentures due June 1 1986 at 100 and 60 million of 4-1/2 convertible subordinated debentures due June 1 1991 at 100
The convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at 65 a share by June 1 1966

75 by 1976
80 by 1981
85 by 1986 and 90 thereafter

-- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund on Oct. 23 1959 and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on Feb. 8 1960
Something has gone wrong some place
I am getting dividends on only 50 shares
In other words I am getting only half the dividends I should
-- Write to the fund 's custodian bank -- the First National Bank of Jersey City N.J.
That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund Fundamental Investors Diversified Investment Fund and Television-Electronics Fund
The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things
But it seems that this `` electronic brain `` was n't `` programmed `` correctly
This resulted in a great number of errors
And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders
I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation
At that time the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand
They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected `` within 60 days ``
That 60-day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds complaining about mistakes in their accounts
Maybe it 's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected
Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank

-- Alfred Hayes president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms `` which would basically alter the international financial system
Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations `` there is no reason in my judgment why the international financial system can not work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future ``
Washington UPI
-- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake Ohio and Baltimore Ohio Railroads merge
Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger but could possibly be an ultimate effect
The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C O 's request to control and then merge with the B Aj
`` All these kind of things weaken us `` Perlman said
Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore Ohio Railroad Co. testified the B O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake Ohio Railroad
`` The financial situation of the Baltimore Ohio has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s `` he told the hearing
C O president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case
The New York Central also has asked the ICC to permit it to gain control of the B Aj
Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger
The proposed C O-B O railroad would make it the hemisphere 's second largest

Washington March 11 UPI
-- `` Consumer uncertain about economic conditions ``
This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center
Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify ``
The poll was taken at the Center 's annual builders intentions conference
It disclosed that the builders
Expect their own production volume and presumably sales to jump 30 percent in 1961
Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960 's 1,257,700 non-farm housing starts
The industry has said 1960 was a poor year
Starts were down 20 percent from 1959
Why the discrepancy between the builders forecasts for themselves and for the industry
Leaders of industry
The reason says the Housing Center is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders ``
Elburn Ill
-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales `` We 've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more
We sold only four pickers all last year ``
Gus Ehlers competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community says his business since August 1 is running 50 above a year earlier
`` Before then my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 `` he says
Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas
Paradoxically the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output
Although the Administration 's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 farmers with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines
Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment can not handle them efficiently
The higher price supports provided by the new legislation together with rising prices for farm products are pushing up farm income making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery
Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10 above last year
`` In August our dealers sold 13 more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14 higher than last year `` says Mark V. Keeler farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co.
For the year to date sales of the company 's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5 behind 1960
Two of three report gains
Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier with the increases ranging from 5 to 50
Not all sections are showing an upswing however
the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend
The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry
The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally
Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products
More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation 's trucks buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances chemicals and other products
Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they 're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago dealers report
`` Farmers are n't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale `` says Jack Martin who sells J. I Case tractors and implements in Sioux City Iowa
`` This morning we allowed a farmer 600 on the old picker he traded in on a new 2,700 model
Last year we probably would have given him 700 for a comparable machine ``
Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August
in August of 1960 he sold seven
Dealers stocks down
With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25 below a year ago the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country 's farm equipment manufacturers
For example farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5 above a year earlier Mr. Keeler reports
Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson Ltd. of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier says John Staiger vice president
With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements
Merritt D. Hill Ford Motor Co. vice president says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers
Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959
The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government 's new feed grain program was adopted
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20 in planted acreage and as a result reduced the immediate need for machines
Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects
Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129 of the 1947-49 average three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960
The Government also is aiding farmers income prospects
Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers 1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments well above the record 1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the 639 million of 1960
Price support loans may total another 1 billion this year
With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 farmers gross income is estimated at 39.5 billion 1.5 billion above 1960 's record high
Net income may reach 12.7 billion up 1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953
The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month reaching 242 of the 1910-14 average compared with 237 at mid-July
Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling
The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined
The company in figuring its taxable earnings deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products
Such `` depletion allowances `` in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets
The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground not to the revenue from finished products
A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling 's impact on prior-year returns still under review for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products
The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50 of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone
President Kennedy in signing the relief measure into law stressed he regarded it as an exception
`` My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries `` the President said
Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S
The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date purpose amount and other particulars of the contribution
Requests for substantiation the Service indicated can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return such as tickets to a show
In such an instance revenuers stressed the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received
A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested
A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax under Federal law on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation
Louisiana however collected an income tax on the profits from the sale
The corporation in filing its final Federal income return claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense as permitted under U.S. tax law
The Revenue Service disallowed the claim invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income
The Tax Court rejected this view
It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations
The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S ruling on the subject
The Service has not said what its next step will be
Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency
It provides that the 1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get after serving a two-year hitch without pay will be spread over both years not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received
The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back `` to the company 's advertising manager the Tax Court ruled
The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager
The Court upheld the taxpayer 's contention that these `` kickbacks `` were not his income though they passed through his hands
The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved commenting `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction ``
A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel
The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers excise tax on household-type appliances
Hiring the wife for one 's company may win her tax-aided retirement income
A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls for example may be entitled to distributions under the company 's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage
She would be taxed on the pensions when received of course but the company 's contributions would be tax-free
A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement experts warn is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income
In that event they note the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law
Possible upshots The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made
State briefs Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2 sales tax within that area
Colorado has a 2 sales tax
Denver itself collects a 1 sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax
The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state 's occupation tax applied to sales made at cost to an oil company by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent
The state 's occupation tax is computed on gross sales
The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities
-- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months the Government reported
The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under 18 billion in April down 1 from the March level of more than 18.2 billion
April sales also were 5 below those of April last year when volume reached a record for any month 18.9 billion see chart on Page One
The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year two weeks earlier than in 1960 and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March
Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March
Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5 from those of the month before which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of 17.8 billion

The attractive Greer Garson who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles prefers timeless classical designs
Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It 's unlike me ``
In private life Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas where they maintain an apartment to their California home in Los Angeles suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos New Mexico
Therefore her wardrobe is largely mobile to be packed at a moment 's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle
Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she does n't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter ``
A favorite is Norman Norell however
She likes his classic chemise
Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell a black and white organdy and silk jersey
Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette
She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and Helen Rose
Balenciaga is her favorite European designer
`` I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young actress `` she reminisces
`` I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion ``
Black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks reds blues and greens
Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent Greer Garson was born in County Down Ireland
Her mother was a Greer and her father 's family came from the Orkney Isles
Reared in England she studied to be a teacher earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the University of London
She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned to London to work on market research with an advertising firm
Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory Company and she soon became the toast of the West End
Among stage performances was a starring role in `` Golden Arrow `` directed by Noel Coward
It was during `` Old Music `` at the St. James Theater that Hollywood 's Louis B. Mayer spotted her
After signing a motion-picture contract she came to America and had `` Goodbye Mr. Chips `` as her first assignment after a year 's wait
Other triumphs include `` Random Harvest `` `` Madame Curie `` `` Pride and Prejudice `` `` The Forsythe Saga `` and `` Mrs. Miniver `` which won her the Academy Award in 1943
Honors that have come to Greer Garson are countless
Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in `` Sunrise at Campobello ``
She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from `` Captain Brassbound 's Conversion `` to `` Camille ``
She is in Madame Tussard 's Waxworks in London a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states
She is adept at skeet shooting trout fishing Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology
She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts
She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations
Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New Mexico
Back in college today 's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas Tech class on food
The pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long -- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy
Last October he gave a public speech in Washington D.C. entitled `` Are Women Here To Stay ``
So you can see that Gerald G. Ramsey director of SMU 's food services is not the ordinary type of craven women-trodden chef
He is apt to rear back and claim his rights
Ramsey as SMU 's food wrangler buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week
Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman 's burden
He also dishes up 3,000 snacks
And he operates three cafeterias in the Student Center along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the athlete 's tables
Ramsey 6-3 195 and ruggedly slim says `` I ca n't remember when I did n't pester my mother to teach me to cook ``
He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950 before he moved to Aj
And you 'll notice that in both places there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line
What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table
`` Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat `` says Ramsey
So he hides the mayonnaise
And to keep athletes stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress he bans all highly flavored condiments
What do the pretty SMU girls like on their plates
`` Pretty much hamburger hotdogs steak and at night maybe pizza `` says the handsome food expert
`` Unfortunately there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower ``
Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman Henry Cabot Lodge the King of Morocco Clement Atlee and other shiny characters
Once four Tibetan monks in their saffron robes filed through the cafeteria line
`` They are n't supposed to look at women you know `` Ramsey recalled
`` What with all those pretty girls around they had a hard time ``
Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest
Salt and pepper each breast
Dip in melted butter and roll in flour
Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan
Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F. until lightly brown
Add enough warmed cream seasoned to taste with onion juice to about half cover the chicken breasts
Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer
While this is baking saute mushrooms fresh or canned in butter
Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts
Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes
Leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac says Ramsey
Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern many design facets warmth dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability
That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month
Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20 's and '40 's two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated but warm look in contemporary
These two Heritage and Drexel chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece but a collection of correlated designs each of which could stand alone
The Heritage collection to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson 's Studio has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time
Called Perennian to indicate its lasting good today and tomorrow quality the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces
Walnut wormy chestnut pecan three varieties of burl hand-woven Philippine cane ceramic tiles marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors brick or paneled walls windows that bring in the outdoors
It is a collection with a custom-design look offering simplicity with warmth variety and vitality
The Drexel collection called Composite to be shown by Titche 's offers a realistic approach to decorating a mature modern that is a variation of many designs
Rounded posts give a soft sculptured look paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia
A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest
An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented with a young basic functional group of chests dressers and corner units and a canted headboard
The other bedroom has heavier styling door-fronted dressers with acacia panels a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror
Colorful bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics with the magenta pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite
The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles
Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel 's fall 1961 group Composite
The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top
See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor
To bring warmth to the dining area golden orange tones are used in the fabrics
Dignity and comfort in a contemporary manner reflecting the best aspects of today 's design with substance and maturity keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage
Center panel hand-screened wood actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases
Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile
The Vagabonds are `` on the road `` again

Guests from across U.S. honor Dr Swim
When Dr. W. A Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club guests came by chartered plane from all over the country
A flight originating in Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points
Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known Dr Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles
He started practice in 1917 and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners
Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage
A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing
She put the violin away and took out some linen needles and yarn to while away the long idle days in Budapest
Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and at 26 she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles
Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna
There they continued their studies at the university she in art he in architecture
And there she had her first showing of tapestry work
There 's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today
What most people do n't seem to realize if they are n't tied up with the thing as I am is that 90 of the problem is transportation
I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school
It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school
Getting to and from school was no problem
They either walked or were driven
Now they go to a high school that is two miles away
One might think the problem would be similar
They could walk ride on a bus or be driven
It 's much more complex than that
Generally they go to school with a girl named Gloriana who lives down the block and has a car
This is a way of getting to school but I understand it entails a certain loss of social status
A young man does n't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who is n't even in a higher class than he is and is also a girl
`` Why do n't you walk to school then ``
I suggested
`` My father walked through two miles of snow in Illinois ``
`` Did you ``
I was asked
`` No `` I said `` I did n't happen to grow up in Illinois ``
I explained however that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom
I had to ride a streetcar two miles
Sometimes the streetcar was late
Sometimes there were n't even any seats
I had to stand up with the ladies
Sometimes I got on the wrong car and did n't get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other dismal place and had to spend the day there
I 've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then
When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car
She has to have at least one car herself
I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman
Even that is n't satisfactory
If they have to take any car they 'd rather take the big one
They say that when they take a car Gloriana does n't take her car but rides with them
But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car is n't big enough
The logic of that is impeccable of course except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself
The solution naturally is the bus
However it 's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and it 's too hard on my legs
My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there
But that 's hardly realistic
Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman and he 's already got an education

Here 's an idea for a child 's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming using puppets for lamp bases
Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action rather than put away in boxes
Displayed as lamps the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent
To create such a lamp order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop
Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket allowing three to four inches above the puppet 's head
Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` L `` the foot of the `` L `` about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly under the light
Using the strings that manipulate the puppet suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base
In this way you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position with feet or one foot barely resting on the pedestal
If the puppets are of uniform size you can change them in accord with your child 's whims
Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child 's playtime
Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round
The scalloped edge is particularly appealing
Today 's trend toward furniture designs from America 's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era
A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions
In the background lurked the feeling however that these pieces beautiful as they were lacked the utilitarian touch
So junior 's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks `` while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only
This is n't true of the many homemakers of the 1960 's according to decorator consultant Leland Alden
Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical ``
There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop `` down to earth `` designs -- or go out of business
Hotel Escape 's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction the versatile `` Kings 4 Plus Two ``
This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated fast moving outfit specializing in skits vocals comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch
Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth Bill Kay Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens
The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine and the beat is solid
In the comedy division the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props
Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense part of which can be classed as pure slapstick
Kings 4 have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs

Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it 's substantially the same format heard last spring
Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano Wes Robbins bass and trumpet and Jack Kelly on drums
It 's a solid show but except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie it 's Al 's all the way
Maestro 's biggest stock in trade is his personality and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience

Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism 's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world
More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church
At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged
A young real estate salesman Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force
He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing
Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism but never felt there was anything he as an individual could do about it
When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it
The best approach he figured was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church
And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity
So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program
This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation
a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami
and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days by Ted Place director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ and Jon Braun director of Campus Crusade for Christ
The second half of the film `` Communism on the Map `` and the movie `` Operation Abolition `` also will be shown
Response to the program has been so encouraging Kern said that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon
And to encourage other churches to try their own programs Kern said this Sunday 's sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations
The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week
Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter family 3181 SW 24th Ter will be the Family Dedication Service planned for 10:50 a.m. Sunday at First Christian Church
It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies
The first one two years ago changed the routine of their home life
`` When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith you strive a little harder to uphold those vows `` explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class
Until that first dedication service he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home
They have five daughters -- Coral Lee 5 Glenda Rae 4 Pamela 3 Karen 2 and Shari five months
But after that service they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table have bedtime prayers and Bible stories
To their surprise the children all were eager and quite able to take part
Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her

The Leningrad Kirov Ballet which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House is I think the finest `` classical `` ballet company I have ever seen and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky `` Sleeping Beauty `` with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing
This work is no favorite of mine
I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar infantile and reactionary aspect
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms
All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov 's utterly captivating presentation
The reasons for this enchantment are numerous but most of them end in `` ova `` `` eva `` or `` aya ``
In other words no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet

These qualities alone however would not account for their success and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company 's collective personality
It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet
Oh-the-pain-of-it that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety is totally absent from the Kirov
This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics
But obviously at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned
Irina Kolpakova the Princess Aurora of Friday 's performance would be a change for the better anywhere at any time no matter who had had the role before
She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on and her dancing has a feminine suavity lightness sparkle and refinement which are simply incomparable
Alla Sizova who seems to have made a special hit in the East was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner Yuri Soloviev was wonderfully virile acrobatic and poetic all at the same time in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky
Vladilen Semenov a fine `` danseur noble ``
Konstantin Shatilov a great character dancer
and Inna Zubkovskaya an excellent Lilac Fairy were other outstanding members of the cast but every member of the cast was magnificent
The production designed by Simon Virsaladze was completely traditional but traditional in the right way
It was done with great taste was big and spacious sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes but sumptuous in a muted pastel-like style with rich quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery
Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster Guy Lumia were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity
Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society
The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the Mills Chamber Players
Sustaining members may sign up at 25 for the ten-concert season
annual members may attend for 16
Participating members may attend five of the concerts for 9 not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle
Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at 2 may be addressed to the society 1044 Chestnut Street San Francisco 9
San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children
Fire Fighters Local 798 which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys which will be repaired by off-duty firemen
Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year
They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall and at the Junior Museum 16th Street and Roosevelt Way
From the collection centers toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution
Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys 676 Howard street San Francisco 5 and listing the parent 's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12
Requests must be mailed in by December 5

For A good many seasons I 've been looking at the naughty stuff on television so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies
After all this year 's movies are next year 's television shows
So I went to see `` La Dolce Vita ``
It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality
All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film
If that 's all the Romans did it 's a surprise to me that Rome fell
After television `` La Dolce Vita `` seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night
I can not imagine a single scene that is n't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every week
I believe TV watchers will be bored
`` La Dolce Vita `` has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV Western
Week in week out there is more sex to be seen in `` The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet ``
There is more decadence on `` 77 Sunset Strip ``
There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series
In another respect television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns
With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg the credits are as unfamiliar as you 'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater
Most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party `` at a seaside villa
Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties
The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease carried as far as a black slip
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face
a frigid beauty and three silly fairies
Put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of dull
Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall
What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining
As A moral shocker it is a dud
But this does n't detract from its merit as an interesting if not great film
The Chronicle 's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly
`` This is a long picture and a controversial one but basically it is a moral enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political cultural and religious glories ``
And when they sell it to television in a couple of years it can be shown without editing

And you think you have language problems
The week went along briskly enough
I bought a new little foreign bomb
It is a British bomb
Very austere yet racy
It is very chic to drive foreign cars
With a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back
You must also wear a car coat
The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive
But we could n't really get along without it
`` Where do you put the lighter fluid ha ha ``
Asked the gas station man
The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor
Gas station people are very debonair about small cars
When I drove a car with tail fins I had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases
My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth
This excellent foreign bomb takes only six
When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome the gas people were happy to see me
`` Tires OK
Check the oil and water sir
They polished the windshield
They had a loving touch
The man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank
`` What kind of car is it ``
He asked gloomily
`` It is a British Austin the smallest they make ``
`` Get much mileage ``
`` About 35 ``
The gas station man sighed unhappily
`` What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that
Crunch that 's all she wrote ``
`` I will die rich ``
`` That will be 1.80 `` said the gas station man
`` The windshield looks pretty clean ``
Ah the fair-weather friends of yesteryear
When I wheeled about finned fore and aft I was the darling of the doormen
Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely
With a small bomb I tuck it between Cadillacs
The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself

At last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman Duncan Phyfe whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U. S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings
The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion 's library
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 's
The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey whose famous estate `` Tranquility `` was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover N. J.
Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago
This acquisition is a matched perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long plus six sidechairs and two armchairs
The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy 's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home
It is the AID 's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana `` before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall
The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture
The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem Mass an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792
The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace
It will be painted to match the paneling in the room
The AID committee 's chairman in charge of the redecoration Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project
Mrs. Lenygon 's committee associates announced formally yesterday by the AID in New York include Mrs. Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J. Jussel both wellknown Manhattan decorators
Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank E. Barnes of Boston
President Kennedy could n't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people 's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard N. C.
But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music
At 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp and to greet the 325 crippled cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert
It was the first in the series of `` Concerts for Young People by Young People `` to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House
She was not present yesterday however to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience
She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port Mass and in his welcoming remarks the President said he was representing her
As he approached the open bandstand erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion the band struck up the `` Star Spangled Banner `` and followed it with `` Hail To The Chief ``
`` I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band and we are grateful to them `` President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl
After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students President Kennedy said `` As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music ``
He added `` I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field ``
Displaying his knowledge of music the New England-born President remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers and their work is being duplicated all across the United States
`` This is a great national cultural asset and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me representing as I do today my wife to welcome all of you here today at the White House ``
As he left the bandstand to return to his office the slender sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests
He expressed surprise to learn that pretty blonde Patricia Holbrook 16 of Mount Rainier had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston
`` The nuns there do a wonderful work `` the President commented
Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District
Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red white and blue ribbon
They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff
Many of the music-loving members of the President 's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience
And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected
Henry Hall Wilson a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President 's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives turned guest conductor for a Sousa march the `` Stars and Stripes Forever ``
Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy 's Social Secretary Letitia Baldrige told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring
He said he contacted a friend Henry Hall Wilson on the President 's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series
A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert
One of the most interested `` students `` on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House was Letitia Baldrige social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy
`` I was an art major in college `` Miss Baldrige explained
`` I 've been here so many times I could n't count them ``
She turned out to be a fan too of Margaret Bouton the Gallery 's associate curator of education
Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m.
The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m. remaining for about 45 minutes
The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later
They decided that they thought Rembrandt 's self-portrait made him look `` sad ``
they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael 's `` Alba Madonna `` and `` texture `` in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral
Everybody had heard of Van Gogh the French impressionist
Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them
He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director Richard Bales
I 'm sure you 've heard of him and his record The Confederacy ``
Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group went one of the Gallery 's blue-uniformed guards
In 45 minutes the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century
A few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art ``
Among the other artists whose paintings were discussed were Boucher Courbet Fra Angelico
The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery 's rotunda fountain `` because it 's on the second floor ``
That imposing somewhat austere and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw took on bustling life yesterday
More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader Albert Pike who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891
They came together in the huge high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized
C. Wheeler Barnes of Denver head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado praised Pike as a historian author poet journalist lawyer jurist soldier and musician who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order
The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple
A reception and tea followed
About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States
The opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today
There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m.
A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington one of this Nation 's first Masons -- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria
The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years
John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous
He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children or spend much time chatting with his wife
Hurt by his lack of interest and attention Mary complained often that he did n't help around the house and that he did n't really care about the family
She accused him of ignoring her
He in turn told her she demanded too much
They were both discouraged disgusted and miserable
Mary decided she had had enough
Without any definite plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done
The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer
Family Service sharing in UGF has five agencies in the Washington area
They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems
Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia the agency nearest them
For nearly a year they have been receiving counseling separately and together in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce
The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other
They are now working together toward solving their difficulties
John received a promotion in his firm
He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life
Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings and the children 's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy family rough-housing
To outsiders the Blacks seem to be an ordinary happy family and they are -- but with a difference
They know the value of being just that -- an ordinary happy family
Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area
Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital
But to the families it serves their help can not be measured
Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund
Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze
For crucial encounter
One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev
Mr. Kennedy replied
`` I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground ``
The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable
But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting
He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy
Last Friday the White House announced
President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4
The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations
The heightened tension in fact had been a major factor in the President 's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader
He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned
But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe
That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting
Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war
Road to Vienna
The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations ``
The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of Geneva ``
The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East
In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S.
That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David `` -- a spirit it later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement
On the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit ``
Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incident
The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda the hope of one-sided concessions and the chance to split the Allies rather than genuine negotiation were the Soviet leader 's real aims in summitry
Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem
Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words
`` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations ``
The President had set for himself the task which he believed vital of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance
He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary
He wanted time too to review the United States global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating
Above all he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev 's doorstep
At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader
Ideally he knew it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels
But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it
It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev 's intentions and to make clear his own views
Moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions
Both elements -- the caution about a meeting the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February
The letter dated Feb. 22 was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk Siberia on March 9
It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues
But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted
Developments over the next two months however caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing
There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly
Deadlock on tests
The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva
The deadlock has been caused by the Russians new demand for a three-man East West and neutral directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery
In the U. S. strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing
Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament
There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly to Communist China
The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent
Moreover Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos
Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible
Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting
Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting
At the same time there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West 's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure
In Cuba the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep
In Laos the picture was almost equally bad
U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized `` on Soviet terms
Beyond that Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces
As a result the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure
In the light of those events there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself
Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader 's mood was cocky and aggressive
He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out
The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back
It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future
Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies
The response from London Paris and Bonn was favorable
Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week
Apparently at the insistence of the U. S. the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the `` informal `` nature of the meeting
The Washington announcement said
`` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries
The meeting will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries ``
The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who in Mr. Kennedy 's own words is `` shrewd tough vigorous well-informed and confident `` and a 44-year-old President his birthday is May 29 with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy
The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval
The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna
The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations
But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary
Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men
The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause
Apart from the personal equation another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit
Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway
This time the initiative came in part at least from Washington
Other allies consulted
There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders
Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity
Finally there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President 's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord
There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world
If tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union
Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse
After Cuba and Laos it was argued Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President 's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds
Moreover the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America 's firm foreign policy commitments
The question was raised for example as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East
There are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory
Mollusks are a case in point
The shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development
Though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education
There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that
By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence
There is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture
Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university
But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy
Official encouragement is one thing but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds
American Catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning
They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made
Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility
All of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise
Yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities
Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible
To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community
It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment
A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere
The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension
The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship
American Catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of `` private enterprise `` -- the `` private enterprise `` of religious communities
Had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees
There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business ``
This `` family-community `` spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement
It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas
I think for example of three women 's colleges with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university which is also co-educational
This is not an isolated example
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough
It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot
Apart however from the question of wasteful duplication there is another aspect of the `` family business `` spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny
For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would seem that today 's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence ``
At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence `` stage of Catholic education the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis
But with today 's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for `` outsiders `` becomes more pressing
The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers `` are needed but that a different brand is called for
Commenting on the earlier stage the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making noted that the term `` teacher-employee `` as opposed to e.g `` maintenance employee `` was a not inapt description
Today however the `` outsider `` is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university
And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement
In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it `` Even with the best of intentions he the President of the university is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which considered as it must be by him in individual terms is inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely varying temperament interests and capabilities
It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and to use that oft-repeated phrase the attainment of excellence ``
The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns `` it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside `` faculty
It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university `` this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension
But in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one
`` Outside `` faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business
There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university
In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel
Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences
Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype
In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere
To appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service
Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure
This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated
When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services
A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family ``
Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions
Adequate compensation is indispensable
Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place
Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university
Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman 's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification
There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels
The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution
But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation
The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group `` that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself
This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure
Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order
The first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority
In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling `` of participation can hardly be `` faked ``
Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions
Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work `` and ersatz decision making
In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all
In the Notre Dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication ``
In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation `` the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy i.e members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements
Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws
Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally
Or in the words of Anatole France `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges ``
The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan 's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and later into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites
The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program
In addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill
It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the employers strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike
Business Week Aug. 9 1961 reports that the United Aircraft Company against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating
The company incurred some 10 million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees hiring and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by the new workers
The company has billed the United States Government for 7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor 's business
Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee
The committee remains unresponsive
Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions
The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained
The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined lines
it must play a game in which there never is a winner
The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully can not follow the law
Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy
Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market
The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied
The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment
Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price
Naturally enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time
Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry
Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition ``
But if they show self-restraint they do n't get the orders
Under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted
Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants
The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows
In other words the anti-trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday Wednesday and Friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday Thursday and Saturday
And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday
The question might be asked `` Do n't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts
Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in the laws ``
The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold in The Folklore of Capitalism back in 1937
He wrote `` P. 211 the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure
P. 214 anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship
P. 215 when corporate abuses were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control
In this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws
Pp 228-229 in any event it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government ``
This escape from control has led to management 's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while
A plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license
The penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities
If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest
A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle
However one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational
Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union
Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform
Before 1933 individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English
The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle
The Wagner Act the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining
The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition
If a union can not perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud
The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession
The problem must be faced squarely
If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them
Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America
As early as 1776 Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work
but many against combining to raise it ``
Eighteenth-century England upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies
In 1825 the Boston house carpenters strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers who declared `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies ``
There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly
The courts shared the opinion of the employers
In People vs. Fisher Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared
`` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means ``
Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 1961 defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment ``
Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation
His bill allegedly aimed at Hoffa would amend the Sherman Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international
Paradoxically the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act
Indeed it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws
for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers
At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates
The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies
It was most effective against trade unions
In the famous Danbury Hatters case a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices e.g trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer
The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment
In 1914 the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity
The law could not suspend economics
Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws
The courts by interpretation emasculated the act
In 1922 the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company
The company sued under the anti-trust laws alleging that the union 's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce
What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise
The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce
the three-front war
At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad
Afterward Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen
What Herter presented said Gore was `` not a very encouraging review ``
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts
While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions
1 Cuba
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand within 48 hours the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens plus 120 Cuban employees
President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately
`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure `` said the President
`` That limit has now been reached ``
Through Secretary Herter Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision
Kennedy through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk declined
He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America see the hemisphere
2 Laos
After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam
`` In view of the present situation in Laos `` said the Pentagon 's announcement `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific ``
Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea accompanied by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines
On the U.S. 's island base of Okinawa Task Force 116 made up of Army Navy Marine and Air Force units got braced to move southward on signal
But by week 's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration see foreign news and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos
French Indians
There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts
Political economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right
`` It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again `` said one military man
But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground
At Geneva in 1954 to get the war in Indo-China settled the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state North Viet Nam -- which then predictably became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos
The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West
He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj
`` The important thing from now on `` he said `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia ``
Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana Russian intrigue in the Congo and Russian arms drops in Laos using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time
Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year 's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply
Considering the state of the whole world the cold war 's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous
but in Senator Gore 's words it was `` not a very encouraging `` situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day
turmoil in the House
As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor
The liberal pressure bloc which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group had fought the committee before and had always lost
This time they were much better prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable
They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck
And counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will
Deadly deadlock
There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee 1 to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock or 2 to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi 's 14-term William Meyers Colmer pronounced Calmer
Caucusing the liberals decided to go after Colmer which actually was the more drastic course since seniority in the House is next to godliness
A dour gangling man with a choppy gait Colmer looks younger than his 70 years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative
He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents
He is of course a segregationist but he says he has never made an `` anti-Negro `` speech
For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee
There his vote along with those of Chairman Howard Smith the courtly Virginia judge and the four Republican members could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes
Equal treatment
There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer 's ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi
Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons
In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman and in 1957 after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage
In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell
Said he `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here ``
But Speaker Sam Rayburn after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective
In a tense closed-door session with Judge Smith Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the Rules Committee two Democrats including one Southerner and one Republican
Smith flatly rejected the offer and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels
The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust Colmer whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man ``
News of Rayburn 's commitment soon leaked out
When Missouri 's Clarence Cannon got the word he turned purple
`` Unconscionable ``
He shouted and rushed off to the Speaker 's Room to object `` A dangerous precedent ``
Cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces as chairman of the Appropriations Committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects
Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally Georgia 's Carl Vinson chairman of the Armed Services Committee
Threat of war
As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses it became clear that Judge Smith could lose
His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus
The liberals smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees in the full party caucus and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer
One big question If Colmer was to be purged what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors
In all three arenas they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash
But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war
If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party
With that possibility in mind Arkansas Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise
`` Here are two old men mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone `` said a House Democratic leader
`` One wants a little more power and the other does n't want to give up any ``
Battle in the senate
The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle but in contrast with the House 's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide 's speech
Question at issue How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters
A wide-ranging bipartisan force -- from Minnesota 's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills
New Mexico 's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate 's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds
Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators
Georgia 's Dick Russell objected politely and the battle was joined
Privately the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage
Privately they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson 's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon
In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding
Armed with the Nixon opinion the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week
Hopefully the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all
Since Election Day Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view
But with the convening of the new Congress he was the public man again presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy 's Inauguration
One day last week Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote and then to make `` sufficient declaration `` of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election
Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration ``
`` This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated `` he said
The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves
Gary Player the small trim South African was the eventual winner but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap
Arnold Palmer the defending champion lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief
`` Just when you think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you `` Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament
And that is just what happened on the last few holes
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer
Player was the first to feel its teeth
After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament Sunday 's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed Player 's game rapidly fell to pieces
He bogeyed the 10th
After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th
He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280
As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course Player was almost in tears
He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke
Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes
Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf
When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole he seemed to have the championship won
But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression
In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower
Afterwards Palmer told Charlie Coe his last-round partner that he simply played the hole too fast
He did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost
When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by 15 feet
Palmer was now putting merely for a tie and Player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt
Palmer 's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe
The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69
End at seven
Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place
As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69
His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score a 213 by Bill Collins the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long
But Palmer knew as did everybody else at Augusta that his streak was about to be broken
Half an hour after he finished his round Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 four strokes ahead of Palmer
More than a streak had ended
Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player
Unlike most such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously although this was not exactly the case
When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer 's towering prestige
As if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments
Player won only one
But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere
On the final round at Pensacola the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come
On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it
But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour
Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer
He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer 's 71
Thereafter until the Masters Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami
When they reached Augusta last week together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date
On Thursday the first day of the Masters the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly
It was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course
The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences
Palmer 's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead which he shared with Bob Rosburg
But Player was only one stroke back with a 69
Even so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be essentially a match between Palmer and Player
A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus the spectacular young amateur who had a 70
or Ken Venturi who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better
or Rosburg whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta 's treacheries
or even old Byron Nelson whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf
On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe
On Friday a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus
Rosburg had started early in the day and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg who ended with a 73 was not having a good day
As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender
Player began with a birdie on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th
On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament
He birdied the 13th the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies one bogey and 12 pars for a 68
Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle Palmer birdied the 2nd the 9th the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies one bogey and 13 pars for a 69
The roar of Palmer 's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player 's gallery for a similar triumph
At one point late in the day when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole
Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed although he later admitted that he had Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply
The boldness of champions
Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course
It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence
The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions
Bob Jones played that way
Byron Nelson did Hogan did
And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did
As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was Player 's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead
This day Palmer had started first
As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day
Player immediately proceeded to follow suit
In fact he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well to go 4 under par for the first eight holes
But Player 's real test came on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards
He hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways
Having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out
Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 or gambling
The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green
`` I was hitting the ball well `` Player said later `` and I felt strong
When you 're playing like that you 'd better attack ``
Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget
It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge
From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4
Palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles
They started on the 4th hole a 220-yard par-3
On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days
At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green
His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par
Starting the second nine Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it
When Mickey Charles Mantle the New York Yankees man of muscle drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers his feat touches upon the sublime
When Roger Eugene Maris Mantle 's muscular teammate powers four home runs in a double-header his performance merits awe
But when tiny 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because as a teammate explained `` the other team thought no one was out there `` hits seven home runs in four months three more than his total in 1958 1959 and 1960 his achievement borders on the ridiculous
This is Baseball 1961
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous
It is the year when 1 amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented style delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs
2 Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate 's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game
3 the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them
and 4 catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat two of them as a pinch-hitter
Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike zone and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal
Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion
Whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records home-run division
Of all the records in peril one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now doubly dramatic in its jeopardy
This of course is baseball 's most remarkable mark The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete George Herman Babe Ruth of the Yankees
Since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth 's record and each in turn has been thwarted
What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth 's amazing September surge
In the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen home runs a closing spurt never matched
Double threat
Always in the abortive attacks upon Ruth 's record one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx 58 in 1932 or a Hank Greenberg 58 in 1938 or a Hack Wilson 56 in 1930 -- made the bid
But now for the first time since Lou Gehrig with 47 home runs spurred Ruth on in 1927 two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60
Their names are Mantle and Maris their team is the Yankees and their threat is real
After 108 games in 1927 Ruth had 35 home runs
After 108 games in 1961 Mickey Mantle has 43 Roger Maris 41
Extend Mantle 's and Maris 's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home runs
This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them
To better Ruth 's mark neither needs a spectacular September flourish
All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September and he will establish a new record
In Ruth 's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games
Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth 's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games
`` Even on the basis of 154 games this is the ideal situation `` insists Hank Greenberg now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox
`` It has to be easier with two of them
How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle ``
Neither Mantle nor Maris understandably will predict 60 home runs for himself
Although both concede they would like to hit 60 they stick primarily to the baseball player 's standard quote `` The important thing is to win the pennant ``
But one thing is for certain There is no dissension between Mantle the American League 's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 and Maris the MVP in 1960
Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs `` I hope Roger hits 80 `` Mantle says and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs `` and I hope I hit 81 ``
The sluggers get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer Mantle 's in Dallas Maris 's in Kansas City they are rooming together
Mantle Maris and Bob Cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in Jamaica Long Island not far from New York International Airport
The three pay 251 a month for four rooms kitchen dining room living room and bedroom with air-conditioning and new modern furniture
Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom
Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room
They divide up the household chores Cerv does most of the cooking breakfast and sandwich snacks with dinner out Mantle supplies the transportation a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium
Mantle Maris and Cerv probably share one major-league record already Among them they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv four for Mantle and three for Maris
As roommates teammates and home-run mates Mantle 29 who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago and Maris 26 who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds
Both were scholastic stars in football basketball and baseball Mantle in Commerce Okla. Maris in Fargo N.D.
as halfbacks both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma `` Sometimes in the minors `` Maris recalls `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma ``
To an extent the two even look alike
Both have blue eyes and short blond hair
Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds but Mantle incredibly muscular he has a 17-1/2-inch neck looks bigger
With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders both must have their clothes made to order
Maris purchases 100 suits from Simpson 's in New York
Mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as 250 each
Light reading
Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus Henry Miller 's `` Tropic of Cancer ``
Mantle so appreciated Miller 's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips
Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or for that matter to private speaking
`` What do you and Mickey talk about at home ``
A reporter asked Maris recently
`` To tell you the truth `` Maris said `` Mickey do n't talk much ``
This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer
What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying to be cooperative
Of the two Mantle is by nature the less outgoing Maris the more outspoken
But last week when a reporter was standing near Mantle 's locker Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote
`` See that kid ``
He said pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy
`` That 's Yogi Berra 's
I 'll never forget one time I struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game
I came back sitting by my locker feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says You stunk ``
Maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen
`` When I 've made a dumb play `` he says `` I do n't want to talk to anyone
I 'm angry ``
By his own confession Maris is an angry young man
Benched at Tulsa in 1955 he told manager Dutch Meyer `` I ca n't play for you
Send me where I can play ``
Meyer sent him to Reading Pa.
Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 he told manager Kerby Farrell `` I 'm not learning anything on the bench
Play me ``
Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series
`` That 's the way I am `` he says
`` I tell people what I think
If you 're a good ballplayer you 've got to get mad
Give me a team of nine angry men and I 'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we 'll beat you nine out of ten times ``
Idols idols
One good indication of the two men 's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes
Maris 's was Ted Williams
`` When I was a kid `` Maris told a sportswriter last week `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not ``
`` When you came up to the majors did you seek out Williams for advice ``
`` Are you kidding ``
Said Maris
`` You 're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize ``
Mantle 's hero was Joe DiMaggio
`` When Mickey went to the Yankees `` says Mark Freeman an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his
But DiMaggio never said a word
It crushed Mickey
He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him ``
Mantle has kept the vow
Among all the Yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies
Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else
If laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for 1 an hour paid more than playing right field for the Yankees Maris would lay ties on a railroad track
If working in a zinc mine which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour paid more than playing center field for the Yankees Mantle would work in a zinc mine
But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball
They try to play baseball the best they can
Each is a complete ballplayer
Mantle beyond any question can do more things well
`` One of the reasons they get along fine `` says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men `` is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris ``
Hitting Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed Maris only left-handed
They both possess near classic stances dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings
Mantle is considerably better hitting for average
fourth in the league to
for Maris so far this year
Both are good bunters Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues
Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base
Both have brilliant speed Mantle was timed from home plate batting left-handed to first base in 3.1 seconds faster than any other major leaguer
Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio the swift base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox
Both are good daring fielders Mantle covers more ground
Maris 's throwing arm is stronger
Yet with all their skills the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic The home run
With this ultimate weapon the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season
American League expansion created inevitably weaker teams
Only two teams in each league the Yankees and Detroit the Dodgers and Cincinnati are battling for first place
Appropriately the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year came into being at baseball 's lowest moment
In 1920 as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball
Something was needed to revive interest
the something was the home run

Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas as he had hinted upon his arrival `` It 's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia
I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans ``
As the plans were laid some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory 's 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at 10,000 each
The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper who regularly makes up ladies ensembles
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything `` just `` in case he spills anything `` Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing

G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe 's best hotels but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh
There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth a reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art
Last week in the German city of Dusseldorf G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause
On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale
Like Philadelphia 's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public Time Jan. 2 Thompson at 61 is something of a legend in his own lifetime
He made his fortune during World War 2 when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom
Even before he hit big money he had begun buying modern paintings
He gave the impression of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best
He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away and the Museum of Modern Art 's Alfred Barr said of him `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson did n't know about ``
He might barge into a gallery start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting
He could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys but with dealers he was tough
He bought up Cezannes Braques Matisses Legers a splendid Picasso series more than 70 Giacometti sculptures
He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world
All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone 's Throw outside Pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them
Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city
But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum
Pittsburgh turned him down just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years
He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures
Last year Beyeler arranged to sell 1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built
Last week most of the other prizes once offered to Pittsburgh went on the block
At the opening of the Dusseldorf show Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time
In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them
Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town
Thompson himself said `` I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures ``
Break in Georgia
The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color
But in all its 175 years not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms
Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified `` Negro boy and girl
Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate school in Georgia -- and in Alabama Mississippi and South Carolina as well
For 18 months Hamilton Holmes 19 and Charlayne Hunter 18 had tried to get into the university
They graduated together from Atlanta 's Turner High School where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third
The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never to mention the color of their skins
Holmes went to Atlanta 's Morehouse Negro College where he is a B student and star halfback
Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit 's Wayne State University
Last fall after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again
Charlayne was `` tentatively `` admitted for next fall after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State
But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview ``
The evidence in court was testimony about the interview which for Holmes lasted an hour although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation
Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse ``
No said he but officials still called him `` evasive ``
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested ``
Their reason Holmes once paid a 20 speeding fine had his license suspended
Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes
The real reason for his rejection they argued is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school
Judge Bootle 's decision `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color ``
The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university
`` Surprised and pleased `` Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week
Catch for Chicago
When the University of Chicago 's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway
Out went letters to 60,000 old grads asking for suggestions
Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors including Adlai Stevenson Richard Nixon and Harvard 's Dean McGeorge Bundy
The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it `` a top scholar in his own right `` -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago
Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech 's acting dean of the faculty dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle 57 who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry Time Cover July 14 1958
It fell to Chancellor Kimpton now a Standard Oil Indiana executive to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins
He threw out some of Hutchins more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 nearly doubled endowment to 139.3 million
But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era
At Caltech Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school 's famous biology division since 1946
But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making
Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters
he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal and took delight in driving a 250 model A Ford for 22 years then selling it for 300
A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away
The man was King Leopold 2 of the Belgians who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good
By force he took under his protection or stole 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings
they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking
The population of the Congo is 13.5 million divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters `` and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects
The religions of the people include Christianity Mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism
The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate
The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars
To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case
it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done or failed to do in the Congo since 1885
At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience
The Belgian government itself took over administration commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism
One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children ``
The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment
Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant
The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo which is rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil
The colony was administered from Brussels with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote
The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock
In Inside Africa John Gunther describes one of these the Societe Generale as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us say the House of Morgan Anaconda Copper the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York the Pennsylvania Railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with the United States government as a heavy partner ``
Had they been truly ruthless the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion
But they were not
They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent
they put much effort into public housing
They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food
But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often
Would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education
During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo
But almost all the schools were primary
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte `` and `` le chien `` and write his name
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land and trained many
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college
It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together `` a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science
Indeed the Belgians discouraged higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were among its 13.5 million people exactly 14 university graduates
Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it
In one large oversimplification it might be said that the Belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa
They lacked time to prepare the Congo as the British and French had prepared their colonies
The Congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most were unsure what it meant
and in Brussels street crowds shouted `` Pas une goutte de sang
'' Not one drop of blood
The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess
It is hard to blame them for this
Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless
As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties or approximately eight for each university graduate
There were four principal ones
First there were those Congolese among them Joseph Kasavubu who favored splitting the country into small independent states Balkanizing it
Second there were those Moise Tshombe who favored near-Balkanization a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority with much power residing in the states
Third there were those notably Patrice Lumumba who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government
And fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up
However the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting
A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration
They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville Kasai Kivu Katanga Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings
Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war
The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces
Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations
If internal frictions arose they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army the Force Publique which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians
The president Joseph Kasavubu seemed an able administrator and the premier Patrice Lumumba a reasonable man
Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other
Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting
Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country
The Belgian government decided to act and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo
On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga Moise Tshombe announced that his province had seceded from the country
Confusion became chaos
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence
Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them
On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo
Vague in wording it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the Congolese Government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the Government to meet fully their tasks
Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African or at least nonwhite nations -- certainly not from the U.S. Russia Great Britain or France
He quickly called on Ghana Tunisia Morocco Guinea and Mali which dispatched troops within hours
Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden who were the only whites
It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo
The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts
The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians and appealed to Russia for help
However there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist
Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia he first appealed to the U.S. for military help and was rejected
Lumumba further complicated the U.N. 's mission by initiating small `` wars `` with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which under Albert Kalonji wanted to secede as well
Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars `` dispatching `` technicians `` and even threatening on occasion to intervene openly
But by the end of the three-month period in October 1960 something approaching calm settled on the Congo
President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him
Lumumba fired Kasavubu
Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the Congolese army
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York
The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well withdrawing all of their uniformed troops
But they left behind them large numbers of officers variously called `` volunteers `` or `` mercenaries `` who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga the seceded province which according to Tshombe holds 65 of the mineral wealth of the entire country
From October 1960 to February 1961 the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action
There was no directive for it -- the Security Council 's resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or Balkanize it
During the five-month lull civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo
In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe again stirred the U.N. to action
On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo including the use of force if necessary in the last resort ``
Although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably tougher than the earlier one
It also urged that the U.N. eject and prevent the return of all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers
ordered an investigation of Lumumba 's death
urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army
The presidency talking and listening
Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy 's unexpected report from Khrushchev his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week
High up on the President 's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte
On this issue the President received a detailed report from his U.N Ambassador Adlai Stevenson who had just returned from Paris and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio
Ideally the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante `` on Bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base
To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No 2 man in the Tunisian Government Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable
Through Ladgham Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba
and one U.S. official said `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first ``
On the Latin American front the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council which the President himself had originally hoped to attend
Main purpose of the meeting To discuss President Kennedy 's Alliance for Progress
And that was not all
In conferences with Nationalist China 's dapper diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek 's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations
Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia
however the President who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia 's admission comes to a vote
The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid
To Africa he sent his most trusted adviser his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast
All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs
in effect he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason ``
Crime skyjacked
From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies is a routine five hours and 25 minutes including stopovers at Phoenix El Paso and San Antonio
When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer
The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix
Thirty-one minutes later when it took off for El Paso hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard
At 3:57 a.m. with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso passenger Robert Berry a San Antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward the cockpit
`` The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach `` Berry said
`` I figured he was sick ``
John Salvador a farmer from Palm Desert Calif. was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit
`` The kid had a automatic like they issue in the Army `` he said
`` The other fellow had a ``
Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey
the man put his at the head of Capt Byron D. Rickards
To Rickards a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air it was an old story His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa
But last week 's pirates like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra Newsweek Aug. 7 wanted to go to Havana
`` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns `` the elder man told Rickards
The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message
But he told the `` skyjackers `` the 707 did n't carry enough fuel to reach Havana
they would have to refuel at El Paso
Most passengers did n't know what had happened until they got on the ground
Jerry McCauley of Sacramento Calif. one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion
`` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba `` McCauley said `` and like a nut I raised my hand
I thought he was the Air Force recruiter ``
What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew
They chose four Jack Casey who works for Continental Airlines in Houston
Fred Mullen from Mercer Island Wash.
Pfc Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine
Fla. and Leonard Gilman a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol
Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m.
They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen Border Patrol sheriff 's deputies and FBI men who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns
Other FBI men talking with the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana
The ground crew which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes took fully three hours
Still more time was consumed while the pilot at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj
Actually the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane
they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy who thought at first as did most others that it was four followers of Cuba 's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707
Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone
At one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba
As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment
From the luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being Cubans were native Americans subsequently identified as Leon Bearden 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge Ariz. and his son Cody 16 a high-school junior
The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens
The father by accident or perhaps to show as he said `` we mean business `` took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons
At 7:30 a.m. more than three hours after landing the Beardens gave an ultimatum
Take off or see the hostages killed
The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway
Several police cars loaded with armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the big jet
The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines
the plane slowed to a halt
Ambulances baggage trucks and cars surrounded it
The day wore on
At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane
A few minutes later FBI agent Francis Crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed
While Crosby distracted the Beardens stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door
So did hostages Casey Cleveland and Mullen
That left only the four crew members Crosby and Border Patrolman Gilman all unarmed with the Beardens
The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance
He caught officer Simmons eye nodded toward young Bearden and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could
Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over ``
Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. the Beardens were held in bail of 100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines
Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro and live high in Cuba
Back home in Coolidge Ariz. his 36-year-old wife Mary said `` I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs ``
Congress more muscle
Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation
The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history
With the money all but in hand however the Administration indicated that instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000
The `` hold-back `` as Pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and thus the new funds spent prudently
In all the Senate signed a check for 46.7 billion which not only included the extra 3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy but tacked on 754 million more than the President had asked for
The Senate on its own decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command
The House which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President 's urgent call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order
In other areas Congressional action last week included
The Senate by voice vote and the House by 224-170 passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign not too unhappily
The Senate also voted 5.2 billion to finance the government 's health welfare and labor activities
Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill with its controversial long-range proposals had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend
White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact
Food stew a la Mulligatawny
Most members of the U.S. Senate because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they can
But because they are politicians they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter
As a result ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it
Over the years enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes the menu has pursued its drab all-American course
Individual senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan soft-shell crabs from Maryland oysters from Washington grapefruit from Florida
But plain old bean soup served daily since the turn of the century at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho made clear to the citizenry that the Senate 's stomach was in the right place
In a daring stroke the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a 10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel
Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes
Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward
Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative
Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds
Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates
As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments
Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds
Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 according to Standard Poor 's average
On balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then
However in the same three-month period toll-road bonds as a group have bucked this trend
On these bonds price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines
Tax-free returns
Investors however still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds
You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page
Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent or very close to that
And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds
That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds
It 's not much more in fact than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds
For investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high
It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than 16,000 of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than 32,000 of taxed income
Swelling traffic
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening
The report is based on a survey by Blyth Company investment bankers
Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period
And there is the bright note The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession
Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter
Indication The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward
Look for example at the Ohio Turnpike
Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February as compared with those same months in 1960
Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs
As a result the road 's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds
That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months
That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike
Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in March
Costs were held down despite a bitter winter
For the year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121 per cent in the preceding period
The road 's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston
Slow successes
Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do
The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway for example was not opened over its entire length until December 1958
In the 12 months ended in February 1960 the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves
In the 12 months ended in February 1961 this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest
That improvement is continuing
In the first two months of 1961 earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960
Success for many turnpikes has come hard
Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers rosy estimates
In these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways
Many rate increases already have been put into effect
Higher tolls are planned for July 1 1961 on the Richmond-Petersburg Va. Turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study
Easier access
Progress is being made too in improving motorists access to many turnpikes
The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration
Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 1961
Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City Kans and Kansas City Mo
Meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the road 's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years
For some roads troubles
Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals
Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike
If nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962
West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same
These however are exceptions
The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement
It 's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full
Already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins
Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point
A top American official after a look at Europe 's factories thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation `` competitively
Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy 's biggest companies -- Fiat the auto producer and Olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines
Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows --
`` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant and you learn this
`` One modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day
About half of these are exported
`` Two wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs
A skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns 37 a week
`` Three labor troubles are infrequent
Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years
`` Said Secretary Hodges It 's a tough combination for the U.S. to face
`` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges
Olivetti took over Underwood the U.S. typewriter maker in late 1959
Within a year without reducing wages Underwood 's production costs were cut one third prices were slashed
The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled
`` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout modern machinery
The firm is design-conscious sales-conscious advertising-conscious
`` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S.
The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments
`` Hodges predicted I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S.
There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ``
Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports
The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines
Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these
An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy
Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting
The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years
Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet
If they have trouble exporting international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would
Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible
At the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries
Japan since 1957 has been `` voluntarily `` curbing exports of textiles to the U.S.
Hong Kong India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact ``
None of these countries is happy with these arrangements
The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S While they have been curbing shipments they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market
Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly
The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons
The Kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping `` practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas
Gradual controlled expansion of the world 's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants
This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products
It 's an important clue to Washington thinking
Note too that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry
`` Get competitive or get out ``
In veiled terms that 's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry
The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization does n't seem feasible
Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed
Government research will look into new products and methods
Import quotas are n't ruled out where the national interest is involved
But the Kennedy Administration does n't favor import quotas
Rather they are impressed with the British Government 's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products
What 's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries
Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners
Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers mouths water
Steel Company of Wales a British steelmaker wants to bring in Virginia coal cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets
Virginia coal delivered by ship in Wales will be about 2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines
U.S. coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight
Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting narrow and very deep
Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British
Welsh coal miners Communist-led are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal
They threaten to strike
The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in
The British coal industry is unprofitable has large coal stocks it ca n't sell
Every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically `` I 'm sorry but we do n't have that book
There would n't be much demand for it I 'm afraid ``
Behind this reply and its many variations is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest
What to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles
What to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when your budget is pitifully small
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed 500 annually which includes the librarian 's salary and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world 's richest city
The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse
Confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds
In some parts of the country however a co-operative movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis
New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow
Because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works
At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated area
At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System in a high-density area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve
Both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state
It was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today
Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts
An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit
Some library boards are wary of the plan
A large well-stocked library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great
A small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board
Within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved
The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system
All services are given without cost to members
So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op
To set up a co-operative library system the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it
The collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection
Each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency
The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars
In Nassau County for example the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since 1950
This system by virtue of its variety and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation
The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area
The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford
Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965
The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers
Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries
On microfilm headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day as well as bound volumes of important periodicals
The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans
Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day
It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself can not provide
The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries
Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon
East Meadow has philosophy psychology and religion
Freeport houses social science pure science and language
history biography and education are centered in Hempstead
Levittown has applied science business and literature
while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art music and foreign languages
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service
This kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course
Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis
Local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library
The system passes on these savings to its members
Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing
Books are not the only resource of the system
Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities
The most recent film catalogue available at each library lists 110 titles presently in the collection any of which may be borrowed without charge
This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some classics cut across age groups such as `` Nanook Of The North `` `` The Emperor 's Nightingale `` and `` The Red Balloon ``
Workshops are conducted by the system 's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service
The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together
consequently an experienced children 's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities cooperating with the children 's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops and frequent visits
Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection
Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups
Story hours pre-school programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children 's consultant
Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries
In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children 's program headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county
it prepares cooperative displays posters booklists brochures and other promotional material for use in member libraries
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used
and it publishes Sum And Substance a monthly newsletter which reports the system 's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries
The system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership
In Nassau as in other systems the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general
Librarians a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results today
Library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans the teen-agers
To them especially the librarians with the help of co-ops hope they will never have to say `` I 'm sorry we do n't have that book ``
Today more than ever before the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned
The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world
The need for lifetime reading is apparent
Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society
The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life
We can not consider ourselves educated if we do not read
if we are not discriminating in our reading
if we do not know how to use what we do read
We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word
A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries
Although progress has been made in America 's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America
The problem grows in intensity each year as man 's knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand
The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition
There are for example approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service
In college libraries 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education
And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all
In every aspect of service -- to the public to children in schools to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services
Only public understanding and support can provide that service
This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week April 16-22 and for its theme `` For a richer fuller life read ``

Technical assistance to small business community
The Small Business Administration SBA provides guidance and advice on sources of technical information relating to small business management and research and development of products
Small business management
Practical management problems and their suggested solutions are dealt with in a series of SBA publications
These publications written especially for the managers or owners of small businesses indirectly aid in community development programs
They are written by specialists in numerous types of business enterprises cover a wide range of subjects and are directed to the needs and interests of the small firm
SBA offers Administrative Management Courses which are designed to improve the management efficiency and `` know-how `` of small business concerns within a community
SBA cosponsors these courses with educational institutions and community groups
Through the SBA 's Management Counseling Program practical personalized advice on sound management principles is available upon request to both prospective and established businessmen in a community
One-day conferences covering some specific phase of business management also part of the continuing activities of the Small Business Administration aid community economic development programs
These short `` streamlined `` meetings usually are sponsored by local banks Chambers of Commerce trade associations or other civic organizations
Product research and development
Production specialists in SBA regional offices are available to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems
Guidance and advice are available on new product research and development
new product potential
processing methods
product and market developments
new industrial uses for raw semi-processed and waste materials
and industrial uses for agricultural products
SBA serves also as a clearing house for information on products and processes particularly adaptable for exploitation by small firms
This may be helpful in improving the competitive position of established firms through diversification and expansion or through more economical utilization of plant capacity
Production specialists are available in SBA regional offices to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems
These problems frequently arise where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications require operations that the firm did not understand when it undertook the contract
Production assistance often takes the form of locating tools or materials which are urgently needed
Advice is given also on problems of plant location and plant space
Property sales assistance
The property sales assistance program is designed to assist small business concerns that may wish to buy property offered for sale by the Federal Government
Under this program property sales specialists in the Small Business Administration regional offices help small business concerns to locate Federal property for sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for surplus personal and real property and certain natural resources including timber from the national forests
SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing
Proposed property sales of general interest to small business concerns are publicized through SBA regional news releases and by `` flyers `` directed to the small business concerns
Each SBA regional office also maintains a `` want `` list of surplus property principally machinery and equipment desired by small business concerns in its area
When suitable equipment is located by the SBA representative the small business concern is contacted and advised on when where and how to bid on such property
Section 8-b-2 of the Small Business Act as amended authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business concerns
The Administration maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered
It is kept in each Regional office for the small firms within the region
Purpose of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities in SBA 's facilities register so that the small business concerns may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized by the Congress in establishing the Small Business Administration
These services include procurement and technical assistance and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts for products and services within the registrants field of operations
SBA can make complete facilities inventories of all small business concerns in labor surplus areas within budgetary and staff limitations

to small business
SBA makes loans to individual small business firms providing them with financing when it is not otherwise available through private lending sources on reasonable terms
Many such loans have been made to establish small concerns or to aid in their growth thereby contributing substantially to community development programs
SBA loans which may be made to small manufacturers small business pools wholesalers retailers service establishments and other small businesses when financing is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms are to finance business construction conversion or expansion
the purchase of equipment facilities machinery supplies or materials
or to supply working capital
Evidence that other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided
Types of loans
SBA business loans are of two types `` participation `` and `` direct ``
Participation loans are those made jointly by the SBA and banks or other private lending institutions
Direct loans are those made by SBA alone
To qualify for either type of loan an applicant must be a small business or approved small business `` pool `` and must meet certain credit requirements
A small business is defined as one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field
In addition the SBA uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar volume of the business
The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough capital in the business so that with loan assistance from the SBA it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis
A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment
The record of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income
The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends on how much is required to carry out the intended purpose of the loan
The maximum loan which SBA may make to any one borrower is 350,000
Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments -- usually monthly including interest at the rate of 5-1/2 percent per annum on the unpaid balance -- and have a maximum maturity of 10 years
the term of loans for working capital is 6 years

Small Business Administration What It Is What It Does
SBA Business Loans
and Small Business Pooling are available on request from Small Business Administration Washington 25 D.C. and its regional offices
The Farm Credit Administration an independent agency located within the Department of Agriculture supervises and coordinates a cooperative credit system for agriculture
The system is composed of three credit services Federal Land Banks and National Farm Loan Associations Federal Intermediate short-term Credit Banks and Banks for Cooperatives
This system provides long- and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing purchasing and business service organizations
As a source of investment capital the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural areas
The credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes
The third credit service Banks for Cooperatives exists under authority of the Farm Credit Act of 1933
The Banks for Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers cooperatives
Types of loans
Three distinct classes of loans are made available to farmers cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives Commodity loans operating capital loans and facility loans
To be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives a cooperative must be an association in which farmers act together in processing and marketing farm products purchasing farm supplies or furnishing farm business services and must meet the requirements set forth in the Farm Credit Act of 1933 as amended
Interest rates are determined by the board of directors of the bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration
For further information contact the Bank for Cooperatives serving the region or the Farm Credit Administration Research and Information Division Washington 25 D.C.

To encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals the Office of Minerals Exploration OME of the U.S. Department of the Interior offers financial assistance to firms and individuals who desire to explore their properties or claims for 1 or more of the 32 mineral commodities listed in the OME regulations
This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms
Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored
The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses
The applicant pays the rest of the cost but his own time spent on the work and charges for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied toward his share of the cost
Funds contributed by the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property
If nothing is produced there is no obligation to repay
A 5-percent royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract is in effect
if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property the royalty obligation continues for the 10-year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government 's contribution is repaid with interest
The royalty applies to both principal and interest but it never exceeds 5 percent
Information application forms and assistance in filing may be obtained from the Office of Minerals Exploration U.S. Department of the Interior Washington 25 D.C. or from the appropriate regional office listed below
In most of the less developed countries however such programing is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent
Only a very few of the more advanced ones such as India and Pakistan have developed systematic techniques of programing
Others have so-called development plans but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them
Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation
We can help in the planning process
Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country
it must express the nation 's own will and goal
Nevertheless we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing
First we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs
Second we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program
Third we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country 's objectives and resources
This includes assistance in -- assembling the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depends
surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication industry and power
designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation
and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established
We must use common sense in applying conditions
The application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds can not of course be mechanical
It must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions
To insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth
In the more primitive areas where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available
Thus we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs
In such a case however we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country 's development was conditional upon programing progress being made
At the other end of the spectrum where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support in cooperation with other developed countries of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country 's development program
The reasons for stressing self-help
A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help
There are many others
It is vitally important that the new U.S. aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves
External aid can only be marginal although the margin as in the case of the Marshall plan can be decisive
External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help
U.S. aid therefore should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take
Aid advice is not interference
In establishing conditions of self-help it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image
Open societies can take many forms and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals
On the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them
Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country 's development potential we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur
The range of self-help
The major areas of self-help are the following A the effective mobilizing of resources
This includes not only development programing but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment
fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation
and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few
B the reduction of dependence on external sources
This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports
It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed
C tapping the energies of the entire population
For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country
Otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability
D honesty in government
In many societies what we regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly
Yet an economy can not get the most out of its resources if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread
Moreover tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest
Some of the most dramatic successes of Communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification -- correct or not -- of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption
A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run but it is politically essential in the long run
U.S. position on self-help
The United States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries making serious efforts in self-help
In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts
There are other countries where with skillful diplomacy we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth
Governments are rarely monolithic
But there will be still other countries where despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help we shall deem it wise for political or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance
Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination
Encouraging a long-term approach
Development requires a long-term approach
The most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention our resources and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries
This is not a short-run goal
To have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion
Most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency
How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country
In several significant cases such as India a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance
These cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance
Gradually others will move up to the same level
The number of countries thus favorably situated is small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world
Meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth
In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible
Aid is a long-term process
The whole program must be conceived of as an effort stretching over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world
It must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba
It is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted
The specific reasons for a long-term approach
A the need to budget a period of years
Many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods
Dams river development schemes transportation networks educational systems require years to construct
Moreover on complex projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence
Thus as a development program is being launched commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year
The capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs
B the need to plan investment programs
More importantly several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence
Without such forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them
or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed
C the need to allocate country resources
Most important of all the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources
They must be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policies
They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section
The taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions
Moreover once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves felt
They must therefore be related to long-range development plans
Providing an incentive
If the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach the United States as the principal supplier of external aid must be prepared to give long-term commitments
In this as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones
The extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets toward which they should be working to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic long-term basis will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them
If they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required
Perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments
You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known
Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people
So I say Mr. Speaker God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world
You remember the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago when someone asked him when he was in Canada and Dean Rusk was in Europe and Vice President Johnson was in Asia `` Who is running the store ``
And he said `` The same fellow who has been running it Sam Rayburn ``
General leave to extend
Mr. McCormack
Mr. Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record
and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend their remarks
The speaker pro tempore
Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts
There was no objection
Remarks of Hon Joseph P. Addabbo of New York
Mr. Addabbo
It is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker the Honorable Sam Rayburn
I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas
I did so because I agree with so many here today that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United States
For the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative branch of our Government -- it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country
To honor him is to honor ourselves
In this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced many memorable moments
Many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me
And like many of you here present I hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable Speaker of the House
At that time he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national and local topics and any problems that I may have been vexed with at the time
He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel
In conclusion he wished me well -- and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children
In my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle
He is most effective in the ordinary business of the House and in the legislative accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion -- even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle -- and as the Nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan
I am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant
He will ever be my example as a true statesman
one who is thoroughly human who affects no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and sterling honesty -- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long
May the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam Rayburn 's continued service here for years to come
Remarks of Hon Wayne L. Hays of Ohio
Mr. Hays
It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise respect and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn
In this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength
He has become in this half century the grand old man of American history
It seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to Providence that Sam Rayburn 's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades
Here briefly in this humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country
But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions Sam Rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this Nation
It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs the aspirations the interests of my district and my State
What Sam Rayburn 's life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one 's own community one 's own district one 's own State and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time
For Sam Rayburn never forgot Bonham his home community and he never forgot Texas
In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community our district our State
And if we follow the Rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country
For what Sam Rayburn 's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district
There is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs
The two are as one
This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson Sam Rayburn 's career up to this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government
More than that Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition
Through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility
Sam Rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions
This means much to the American tradition
It is an answer in its way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics
And the name Rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for the last half century
It is I insist hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes so deep
But this we know Here is a great life that in every area of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor decency and self-respect
I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose
Remarks of Hon Melvin Price of Illinois
Mr. Price
All but two of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under the Speakership of Sam Rayburn
Of this I am proud
I have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness
And Sam Rayburn is a great man -- one who will go down in American history as a truly great leader of the Nation
He will be considered not only great among his contemporaries but as great among all the Americans who have played a part in the country 's history since the beginning
I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn stalwart Texan and great American not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress
Speaker Rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the House in the Speaker 's chair
He had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913 the 63d Congress
No one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam Rayburn
He is the recognized `` father `` of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission
But to run the gauntlet of the programs Sam Rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today 's Record
No greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this House than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker this great legislator this great Texan this great American
My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today
Remarks of Hon John S. Monagan of Connecticut
Mr. Monagan
Sam Rayburn is one of the greatest American public figures in the history of our country and I consider that I have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing Sam Rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States
Others may speak of Speaker Rayburn 's uniquely long and devoted service
of his championship of many of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute books today and of his cooperation in times of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today 's stormy international seas
I prefer to speak however of Sam Rayburn the person rather than Sam Rayburn the American institution
Although Sam Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition
No one could be more devoted than he to the American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world and I shall never forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today 's assault upon popular government
Above all he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman
In this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic and most helpful
On September 16 Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date and in expressing my esteem for that notable American Sam Rayburn
Origin of state automobile practices
The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years
At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917
The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940
The automobile maintenance unit or motor pool came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time
The motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems records keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle operation
Cars were operated in 1959 for an average .027 per mile
Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases
Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes
Vehicle purchase assignment and use policies
The legislature 's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles
The meaningful policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state 's administrative officers
Meaningful policies include A kinds of cars the state should own B when cars should be traded C the need and assignment of vehicles D use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances E employees taking cars home and F need for liability insurance on state automobiles
A review of these policies indicates 1
The state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle
2
The purchase of compact economy cars is being made currently on a test basis
3
Cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy
4
The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances
5
Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles
6
It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes
7
The state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars
Automobile practices in other states
A survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with Rhode Island 's practices
Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business
Two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative approval
States which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool
Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles
Nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances
Of these states the average `` change-over `` point at which a car is substituted for allowances is 13,200 miles per year
Mileage allowances
Mileage allowances for state employees are of two types A actual mileage and B fixed monthly allowances
Actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of .07 per mile
Fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis
Both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state 's Travel Regulations
Rhode Island 's reimburseable rate of .07 per mile for use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states rates
The average of states rates is .076 per mile
Rhode Island 's rate of .07 per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a .09 per mile average
Actual mileage allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state
The travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive
Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject
They have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment
However they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures
Flat payments over 50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles
Travel allowances
Travel allowances including subsistence have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states allowances
With few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and 15 per day subsistence
Travel allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control
Origin of state automobile practices
general background
It is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in Rhode Island
Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940
Those that are available shed little light
The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917
It should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old
The best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920s and '30s
At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties
Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable
Once the principle was established the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly
And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth
Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees
This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself
It does not indicate loose management ineffective controls or poor policy
But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees
In the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now
Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical
The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them
History and operation of the motor pool
While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly
Prior to 1942 automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned
This responsibility included all phases of management
It embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles who was to drive when and where repairs were to be made where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters
In 1942 however the nation was at war
Gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities
The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual
It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit more popularly called the motor pool a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation
The motor pool then as now had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state
It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool 's operation
In 1951 the pool 's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government
The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner ``
Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made
The agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars
Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis
One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35 the total maintenance cost increased only 11
In order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles on July 1 1958 the actual title to every vehicle was transferred by Executive Order to the Division of Methods Research and Office Services
The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles
Note So far as State Police cars are concerned only their replacement is under this division
This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs in light of depreciation become excessive
Moreover it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet
for example if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years rather than 44,000 miles and related higher maintenance costs and 16,000 miles respectively ``
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation
It handles all types of vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on `` service station activities `` than on extensive vehicle repairs
It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work
Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses
Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded for sound economies
From this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data
In 1959-60 vehicles averaged an operating cost of .027 per mile
Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles
They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year
Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random
One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities
Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment
Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more
Purchasing practices
The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state
Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made
Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders
Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public
The reasons are obvious 1 the state is buying in quantity and 2 it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay
Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers discount through the dealers
In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier
This is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles
The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later
Vehicle purchase assignment and use policies
Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles
The legislature 's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles
The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration
The Rhode Island property tax
There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well
For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax
This tax was discontinued in 1936
Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years
At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well
Thus there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and in addition must give assistance to its local governments
This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax or at least at the rates then existing insufficient for their requirements
Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level
Notwithstanding state aid the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax
This is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored
Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off `` nature due possibly to several reasons 1 local assessors in the main are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs 2 the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult and 3 the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property
Problems of taxing personal property
Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant 1 situs 2 fair and equitable assessment of value
These problems are not local to Rhode Island but are recognized as common to all states
Situs of property
Although the laws of the various states in general specify the situs of property i.e residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment
Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated
It also provides for the taxation of all personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible and intangible and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state
In defining personal property it specifically mentions `` all ships or vessels at home or abroad ``
Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year
Although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute this is cancelled out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property `` situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated
This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on December 31
Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category as well as motor vehicles
The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged
Obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December
In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft
A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes on December 31 1960 from the Newport Airpark in Middletown to the North Central Airport in Smithfield
This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably
Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve 12 months next preceding the first day of April in each year ``
The Smithfield tax assessor in turn claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated ``
Assessment of value
This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem
This accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island
This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented ``
The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property
An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State
A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units ``
The Institute of Public Administration in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959 recommended `` consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job ``
The resulting setup it was declared `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island ``
Practices in Rhode Island
To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island
The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case
There are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town
These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time
In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not
The wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations
One assessor checked boats only another trailers and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type
In two cases airplanes only were indicated
It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes
Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats
It would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property
So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive
Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind
Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership
Fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen did not answer
Twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property and only five were opposed
Seven others expressed no opinion
On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now
It is not clear however whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats trailers aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns
Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner
Eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides
Ten others made no reply
Of those who have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred
There was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date
To summarize it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge
The need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies
Boats as personal property
taxing of boats
Interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats
Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than `` a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting
It has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach
Through their professional organization the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed
No satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors
It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars excluding commercial boats
It is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation
It is known that at least five towns Barrington Bristol Narragansett Newport and Westerly place some value on some boats for tax purposes
However few are taxed and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations
No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be
Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law
Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close
The assessors association meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem
Local industry 's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960 's industrial development effort
Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of 11,900,000
a new post-World War 2 record
With minor exceptions this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here
What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry new plants and new jobs
Of the major expansions in 1960 three were financed under the R. I Industrial Building Authority 's 100 guaranteed mortgage plan Collyer Wire Leesona Corporation and American Tube Controls
Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation Cornell-Dubilier Photek Inc. Division of Textron Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry W. R. Cobb Company and Mays Manufacturing Company
Expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development Council 's Industrial Division and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year 's operation
Industrial Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island concerns during 1960 many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location
They are conscious of this state 's new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island
Aids to small business
Although much of the Industrial Division 's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries small business is also afforded considerable attention
Our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous program directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories
A primary function is the operation of a Government Bid Center which receives bids daily from the Federal Government 's principal purchasing agencies
Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations where to obtain specifications and follow-ups concerning qualification
During the past year 10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers
In addition the Office 's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses
how and where to apply for financial assistance
details on marketing
information concerning patents copyrights and trade marks availability of technical reports and other subjects of interest to small business
The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also active in the field of international trade assisting Rhode Island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad
This office cooperates with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include statistics on markets abroad
locating foreign agents buyers distributors etc
information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations licensing investments and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment
During the year 1960 this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce and made 73 field visits
Our media advertising continued during 1960 its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100 financing plant availabilities and location advantages
We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here
To reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from 32,000 to 40,000 and the Industrial Building Authority 's financial participation was upped from 17,000 to 20,000
Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal Eastern and Midwestern editions which averaged two prominent ads per month and to a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and for the west coast the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal Pacific Coast edition
In addition to the regular schedule advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times Boston Herald American Banker Electronic News and for local promotion the Providence Sunday Journal
Magazine advertising included Management Methods The New Englander U. S. Investor and Plant Location
The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics plastics pharmaceutical and business machine manufacturers and to publishers
These totaled 6,768 pieces of correspondence
The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of 239 inquiries
164 from media and 75 from direct mail
Two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries
New York led in the number of inquiries followed by California New Jersey Massachusetts and Pennsylvania
Among foreign countries responding were Germany Canada Brazil and India
An important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term `` Missionary calls `` by one of this Division 's industrial promotion specialists
These consist of visits without previous announcement on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas
More than 25 carefully selected cities were visited including New York Brooklyn Long Island City Newark Elizabeth Stamford Waterbury New Haven Bridgeport Boston Cambridge Worcester and Waltham
Out of a total of 603 calls 452 contacts were established with top executive personnel
We received 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island 's industrial advantages and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits
During 1960 two important conferences were organized by the Development Council 's Industrial Division
In June the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce -- in conjunction with local trade associations chambers of commerce and bank officials -- sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel
Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United States declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959
Approximately 100 representatives of business attended this conclave and the R. I Export Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event
On October 8th of last year the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor 's Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School
A comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals
Morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller Jr. of the U. S. Dept of Commerce
Richard Preston executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission and Edwin C. Kepler of General Electric Company
Workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania Connecticut and Maine and rounded out a rewarding program
In connection with this conference a 64-page supplement was published in the October 2nd edition of The Providence Sunday Journal
Devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division
More than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients
Mailings and publications
Other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor 's Conference letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors
1184 copies of the R. I. Directory Of Manufacturers were distributed 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state
The Industrial Division published in 1960 a new attractive industrial brochure `` Rhode Island -- Right For Industry `` and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers to be printed shortly and for a new space catalogue
Additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation Turnkey the new automated post office and a conference with representatives of Brown University Providence College and University of Rhode Island and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel
Stated in its simplest terms the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island
The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning
Two years ago the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` State-Local Relations In Metropolitan Rhode Island
As the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in this report plus an analysis of our own enabling act the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program
These objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division
1
First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state
2
Recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that `` Metropolian Planning in Rhode Island means or should mean state planning `` the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island 's problems
3
It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government
To this end the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff
4
The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government
among the operating departments of the state
between the cities and towns of the state
and on a regional basis between the six New England states
5
On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources plans for the provision of essential services such as water will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within the framework of the state plan
6
The state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan
7
In preparing the state guide plan particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation
Functionally the planning division carries out four activities long-range state planning current state planning local planning assistance
and the preparation of the state development budget
Long-range state planning
The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation
The long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases basic mapping inventory analysis and plan and policy formation
The work program as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete
Recent events -- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department of Public Works -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated
The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 1961
Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet covering the entire state
With these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started
With the aid of matching federal funds available under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended the planning division began a one year program July 1 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program
This phase consists of four items urban land use rural land use physical features and public utility service areas
Since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible
The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning
The rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use
The mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and like the other two inventory projects are scheduled for completion July 1 1961
The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose
Special districts in Rhode island
It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island
However a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government
There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island excluding two regional school districts four housing authorities and the Kent County Water Authority
These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued and in general to exercise normal corporate powers
Unlike cities and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits
It is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government
In addition to the collection of service charges the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately 450,000
Fiscal years in other states
comparative data
A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report
Included in the findings are 1
Forty-six states including Rhode Island end their fiscal year on June 30
The other four states end on varying dates Alabama Sept. 30 New York March 31 Pennsylvania May 31 and Texas August 31
In sixteen states the fiscal year ending of the cities June 30 is the same as that of the state Alaska Arizona California Delaware Massachusetts Montana Nevada New Mexico North Carolina North Dakota Oklahoma Oregon Vermont West Virginia Wyoming and Hawaii
In eleven states the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 Arkansas Colorado Indiana Kansas New Hampshire New Jersey Ohio South Dakota Utah Washington and Wisconsin
In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31
Georgia Iowa Kentucky Maine Maryland Minnesota Virginia and South Carolina
One state Alabama closes its fiscal year on September 30 and all cities in the state with one exception also close fiscal years on September 30
Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30 while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30
Pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on May 31
All of its cities close their fiscal years on December 31
The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state city and local governments
However only Illinois Oregon Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity
Fiscal uniformity advantages and disadvantages
An excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently
He listed among the values of fiscal uniformity 1
The uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending
The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn
It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts
The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures
By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set on expenditures
The uniform fiscal year brings the town 's fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest share of local disbursements
This greatly simplifies the town 's bookkeeping and financial reporting
The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes
Furthermore tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes augmenting the town 's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy
The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures
When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons
and as the cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also increases
Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare
Of all advantages probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes
Borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times
It may be by bank loans sale of notes or warrants or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants
In any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary
Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs heavy when short-term money rates are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most
This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year
Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security
It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year
Both the federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on July 1
Both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below
It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap
but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions this is no longer true
The haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships
Although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island there are also certain difficulties encountered
These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle
One problem is a matter of shifting dates
the other is how to finance the transition
Little can be done about the changing of dates
This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars
It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time
But cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem
The other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns
This will be covered more fully later
It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city
Fortunately there are no cities or towns in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change
Sacrifice will have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipality 's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely
Adjusting the fiscal calendars
The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them
The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed
Two features are immediately evident
First the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula
Second the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns
There are at least two problems to consider one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar
the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary
The latter matter is considered in detail in a later section
Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar
Plans vary from the `` talking stage `` to establishing special committees to accomplish this end
What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them
An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought
However it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved
The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island based on a July 1 to June 30 year are shown below
No adjustment needed
Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it
No change is required for these towns
These municipalities include Barrington Lincoln Middletown Newport North Kingstown and South Kingstown
Adjustment of fiscal year
One town and one city Coventry and East Providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only
This change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year
Adjustment of tax collection year
Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity
These cities and towns include Bristol Glocester Pawtucket Cumberland Central Falls and Woonsocket
Simultaneous adjustments
Two cities to be considered Providence and Cranston are an enigma
Both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars
However neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year
The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them
In that both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30
These three installment dates would be October 26 January 26 and April 25 Providence and November 15 February 16 and May 15 Cranston
Both would start their new fiscal year on July 1
Their tax collection calendar could then be July 25 October 26 January 26 and April 25 Providence
and August 15 November 15 February 17 and May 15 Cranston
Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods
Varying adjustments
The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30
All of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years
Assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3
Methods of financing adjustments
Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary
It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements
In many communities there is simply no financial problem
it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques
In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes
Fortunately such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule
As shown earlier in Table 1 the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars
In addition no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition
These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible
each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length of the transition interval
Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds
The financial problem where it exists usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period
For those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem

The State Ballet of Rhode Island Week proclamation by John A. Notte Jr. Governor
The ballet originated in Italy about 1450
At that time it was a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps were often combined with other steps devised by the choreographer
Ballet flowered in Italy during the next hundred years and about 1550 was carried to France when the Italian princess Catherine De Medicis married the King of France
The most famous ballet of that time was called Ballet Comique De La Reine 1581
Dances alternated with sung or spoken verses
Ballets were used in opera from its beginning
They were placed either in the middle of the acts or in the intermissions
The State Ballet of Rhode Island the first incorporated group was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge of the art of ballet in the Community to promote interest in ballet performances to contribute to the cultural life of the State and to provide opportunity for gifted dance students who for one reason or another are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional state

Proclamation Thanksgiving Day by John A. Notte Jr. Governor
As another Thanksgiving draws near let us take time out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving
The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during their first year in the new land
They had been through trying times but their faith in the Almighty had given them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were the price they had to pay for freedom
And as the Pilgrims bowed their heads in humble gratitude they shared another feeling -- the anticipation of what the future held for them and their posterity
They could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed countries of the world
They simply turned to God filled with gratitude and faith
We who are living today may learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving Day
The Lord has shown time and time again His love for us
We have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that God 's Providence has been with us since the very beginning of our country
And yet accompanying our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial time
With world peace constantly being threatened most of us regard the future skeptically and even with fear
It is at this time that we should imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for the Lord 's protection in the future if we are to have peace
now therefore do I John A. Notte Jr. governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations proclaim Thursday November 23rd 1961 as Thanksgiving Day
And so let us remember on this day not only to thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage to the Pilgrims but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue to protect us in the future as He has in the past
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of November in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence the one hundred and eighty-sixth

Medical Illustration Service
The Medical Illustration Service is responsible for the collection publication exhibition and file of medical illustration material of medico-military importance to the Armed Forces
In addition to maintaining a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases wounds and injuries of military importance it provides facilities for clinical photography photomicrography and medical arts and operates a printing plant by permission of Congressional Committee for publication of an `` Atlas of Tumor Pathology ``
It also maintains shops for the design and fabrication of exhibits training aids and instruments and libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern slide sets
During this period a total of 762 exhibits were presented at 442 medical and scientific meetings
Of these exhibits 154 were newly constructed
Twenty-nine exhibits received awards
Visual and operable training aids developed by the Medical Illustration Service were used in support of Army Medical Service mass casualty exercises
Members of the Medical Illustration Service lectured and conducted demonstrations on the use of training aids to military personnel and various civilian medical organizations
Demonstrations of new and projected training aids were conducted at the Medical Service Instructor 's Conference Brooke Army Medical Center Texas
In support of the emphasis placed by the Department of Defense on instruction in emergency medical care the Medical Illustration Service developed casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins which are being field tested
and overhead projector transparency sets on the subjects of Military Sanitation First Aid For Soldiers
Bandaging And Splinting
The Emergency Medical Treatment Unit Phase 1
and Emergency War Surgery in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO Handbook
Fifty lantern slide teaching sets on the subject of `` Emergency War Surgery NATO `` were assembled and distributed to the Medical Military Services of foreign Governments associated with NATO and South-East Asia Treaty Organization
The British and Canadian Liaison Officers as well as Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization the American Red Cross and similar interested organizations were informed from time to time as training aids were developed
Nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were developed and distributed and lantern slide teaching sets on 21 pathology subjects were added to the loan library of the Medical Illustration Service
Illustrations were prepared for 11 Department of the Army manuals and one Graphic Training Aid
Sixteen lantern slide sets were loaned to the Government of India and eight sets were forwarded to the U.S. Embassy Managua Nicaragua for the Educational Exchange Program
The Senate Subcommittee on Reorganization and International Organizations was provided samples of visual aids on first aid and personal health produced by the Medical Illustration Service
Six fascicles 10,000 copies each of the `` Atlas Of Tumor Pathology `` were completed during the period of this report
The American Registry Of Pathology
This consists of 25 individual registries two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960 The Registry Of Forensic Pathology and The Testicular Tumor Registry
These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical dental and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural history of various diseases of military-medical importance
The American Registry Of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the National Research Council and The Surgeons General of the Army Navy and Air Force
The staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings exhibits and published studies
During the period of this report 37,470 new cases were entered into the various registries
These were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes
In this same period six new fascicles of the Atlas Of Tumor Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers world-wide
There were 54,320 copies of fascicles sold and 642 copies distributed free during this period
Forty-five new Clinico-pathologic Conferences were prepared bringing the total to 61 available for loan distribution
Nine new teaching Clinico-pathologic Conference sets were prepared which makes a total of 70 types of teaching sets for loan
During this period 7,827 teaching sets were distributed on loan
The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military hospitals
The demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes
The Medical Museum
In fiscal year 1959 the Medical Museum was moved to Chase Hall a temporary building on Independence Avenue at Ninth Street Southwest and continued to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical Services
During the period of this report 63 panel exhibits depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed
Of the 375 exhibits of all types shown 161 were new or refurbished
Of the 885 specimens newly mounted or refurbished 254 were prepared for other agencies
Eighty-five specimens were loaned for study purposes
An exhibit `` Macropathology -- An Ancient Art A New Science `` was presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association
A three-dimensional exhibit depicting `` A Century Of Naval Medicine `` was formally presented to The Director by George S. Squibb great-grandson of the founder of E. R. Squibb and Sons for permanent display in the Museum
Space was provided for short-time guest medical exhibits and the Museum collected new accessions of microscopes medical surgical and diagnostic instruments uniform and similar items of historical medico-military significance
During the period the laboratory rendered centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters
Specimens were mounted for military installations governmental agencies and medical schools
Three hundred five copies of the Manual Of Macropathological Techniques were distributed
Thirty-five military and civilian students received laboratory training
During fiscal years 1959 and 1960 there were 795,586 visitors to the Museum
During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 the Medical Museum was required to move to Temporary Building `` S `` on the Mall from Chase Hall
Throughout the period and during the movement operation the Museum continued its functional support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency
The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency established in 1949 has published since January 1950 The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services
Its supplement The Medical Technicians Bulletin supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel
These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin published continuously from 1907 through 1959 as well as the Navy 's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department published from 1922 to 1949
In addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin
Estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service were between 65,000 and 70,000
Additionally on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage
From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published
Each Journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest and departments devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features of interest to officers of the medical services
The Council on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled `` This Is Your A.M.A. ``
Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting
This resulted in an improved appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds
The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly 4,000 in unexpended funds
Two special issues were published one for November 1959 on Space Medicine the other the Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960
The February 1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled `` The Medical Officer Writes ``
Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin publication of which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue a section called `` Technical Notes `` was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue
Occasional features were published on historical medicine special reports bibliography and `` Collector 's Items ``
In May 1960 the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the `` Medical Museum `` and in June the Institute started contributing a regular monthly `` Case For Diagnosis ``
The Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles beginning in the fall of 1960 on its more significant Scientific Exhibits
The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces
The first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal
Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile
This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago
Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride
The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion
In one of these an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Af and 100 atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved
The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent
This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter
The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy
This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element
A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion
The shutter consists of two parts a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part
Using Edgerton 's method the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil approximately Af placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera
The opening action is obtained when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through the foil
During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera
Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil
Laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra
Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms ions and small molecules
The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres
Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH
somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH SiH and Aj
Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable
in interstellar gas concentrations as low as Af molecules per Af may be sufficient as compared to the Af hydrogen atom 's Af required for detection of the 21-cm line
High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver
therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible
To secure precise measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started
Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead
This involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity
The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical
Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas
the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 Af with an uncertainty of 0.10 Af
Success in observing these spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory
extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported
Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals
Low temperature thermometry
The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af
The efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium-4 vapor-pressure measurements see p. 144
Acoustical interferometer
An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used with helium gas as the thermometric fluid to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 Af
Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer
When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium-4 vapor pressures differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found
This result is preliminary and work is continuing
Resistance thermometers
Carbon resistors and impurity-doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region
Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 Af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium
Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 Af at every 0.1 Af
The estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree
and for the third resistor 3.3 millidegrees
Vapor pressure method
The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature `` liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 Af
Surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15- and 25-liter metallic storage dewars
The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 Af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the yl point
A hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium
However the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb from the liquid helium surface
It has also been observed in helium 2 that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer
This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer
In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow
Pressure transducer for pvt measurements
Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer
A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested
The transducer is a null-type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm 0.001 in thick and 1 in in diameter
A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in apart for Af
Spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit
Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to 250 atm an overload of 300 psi applied for a period of one day results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter of mercury
Transport properties of air
A 6-year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed
This project was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command U.S. Air Force and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding
A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region
Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present
The results of the study based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity thermal diffusion and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 Af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density
International cooperative activities
In March 1961 representatives of the national laboratories of Australia Canada The Netherlands United Kingdom U.S.S.R. United States and West Germany met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 Af
As a first step toward this goal arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory
Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the Aj
These thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory
Temperature symposium
During the last week of march 1961 Columbus Ohio was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature Its Measurement And Control In Science And Industry
The Symposium which was jointly sponsored by the American Institute of Physics the Instrument Society of America and the National Bureau of Standards attracted nearly one thousand registrants including many from abroad
The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack General Chairman and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld Program Chairman
Dr. A. V. Astin NBS Director opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories
In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards spectroscopy solid state physics interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics
The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation
Two data centers have been established for the collection indexing critical evaluation and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross sections
Laboratory astrophysics
Transition probabilities
Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and the Advanced Research Projects Agency a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities
An exhaustive survey was made of the literature and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued
Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation
A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen
This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements
A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent
A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39,000 lines of 70 elements as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc was completed and published
Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities
These data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas
Atomic energy levels
Research continues on the very complex spectra of the rare earth elements
New computer and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success

Mr. Dooley
Mr. Speaker for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have
The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers to name but two
And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service
There have been a number of sound plans proposed
But none of these has been implemented
Instead we have stood idly by watched our commuter railroad service decline and have failed to offer a helping hand
Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957
Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area
Here the New York Central Railroad one of the Nation 's most important carriers has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949
At this time of crisis in our Nation 's commuter railroads a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake Ohio Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore Ohio railroads
The New York Central has pointed out that this control if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission would give the combined C. O B O Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central
Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area
The New York Central notes ``
The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. O B O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues
These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services
If these services are to be maintained the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible ``
The New York Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City
This is a 14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively
A blow to this phase of the Central 's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city
There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. O B O. merger scheme `` --
The Central has pointed out
The logic of creating a strong balanced competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here
Detailed studies of the plan were well underway
Though far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned their investors their customers their users and to the public at large
Then abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned B O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. O. which resulted in the present situation
In the light of the facts at hand however New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest ``
The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C. O B O. merger on June 18
Obviously the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge
However there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss
That is will it serve the long-range public interest
For the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned balanced and competitive railway system
We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter -- the two-way B O C. O. merger or the three-way New York Central B O C. O. merger
Which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders but the interests of all the traveling public
Mr. Lindsay
Mr. Speaker I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper the New York Times on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command
Arthur Hays Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement
I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times
Mr. Sulzberger 's successor as publisher is Mr. Orvil E. Dryfoos who is president of the New York Times Co. and who has been with the Times since 1942
Mr. Dryfoos outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world 's great newspapers will be maintained
I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes a member of the Times staff since 1946 has been appointed as editorial page editor
Mr. Oakes succeeds Charles Merz editor since 1938 who now becomes editor emeritus
I should like at this time Mr. Speaker to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism
My heartiest congratulations go to their successors Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times
The people of the 17th District of New York and I as their Representative in Congress take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world
Mr. Stratton
Mr. Speaker in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine
Yesterday I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its disadvantages
Under leave to extend my remarks I include the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the article from the U.S. News World Report `` your Congressman Samuel S. Stratton reports from Washington May 1 1961
Cuban S.S.R Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week there was at least one positive benefit and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base
In fact one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment
Somehow the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home
Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States violate the Monroe Doctrine and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic
Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this even if we had to go it alone
But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board
For years the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks
But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job
There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week
You can see it for example in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos
efforts as I see it which are being directed by the way toward support for future actions not for those already past
What the next move will be only time of course will tell
Personally I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba
We simply ca n't tolerate further Russian weapons including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles being located in Cuba
Obviously we ca n't stop them from coming in however just by talk
A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine would be a relatively simple operation to carry out and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere ``
from U.s. News World Report May 8 1961
next for Cuba an arms blockade
Look at Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas
How can the United States act
Blockade is one answer offered by experts
In it they see a way to isolate Cuba stop infiltration maybe finish Castro too
This is the question now facing President Kennedy How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere
On April 25 the White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered
Its aim To undermine further Cuba 's economy
Weaken Castro
Another strategy -- bolder and tougher -- was also attracting notice in Washington a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world destroy Castro
Blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine
It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro
It could stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America
It would be the most severe reprisal short of declared war that the United States could invoke against Castro
It is the strategy of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials Members of Congress officers in the Pentagon
As a possible course of action it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions
Among these questions what would a Cuba blockade take
Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers
The Navy on April 25 announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba
More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day 's sailing time away
To round out the blockading force submarines would be needed -- to locate identify and track approaching vessels
Land-based radar would help with this task
So would radar picket ships
A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces
Three requirements go with a blockade It must be proclaimed
the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it
and it must be enforced without discrimination
Once these conditions of international law are met countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk
Blockade runners can be stopped -- by gunfire if necessary -- searched and held at least temporarily
They could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated
What could a blockade accomplish
Plenty say the experts
In a broad sense it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere
It could by avoiding direct intervention provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration
Primary target would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia
Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband
In a total blockade action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals oils textiles and even foodstuffs
At times three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports
From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 66th Congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States by means of grants-in-aid to return disabled men and women to productive gainful employment
The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 of the Social Security Act in 1935
Up to this time and for the next eight years the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling and placement on a job
Recognizing the limitations of such a program the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113 which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised the financing structure
Recent changes
Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled
To assist the States therefore in rehabilitating handicapped individuals `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities `` the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 P. L. 565
These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities for more sheltered and `` half-way `` workshops for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive services to individuals particularly to the homebound and the blind and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness
Financial aspects
Under the law as it existed until 1943 the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis
Under P. L. 113 78th Congress the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100 of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled and for 50 of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services
Throughout these years the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act
The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program providing for a three-part grant structure -- for 1 basic support
2 extension and improvement
and 3 research demonstrations training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation -- and in addition for short-term training and instruction
The first part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section
Subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure
The following table shows for selected years the authorizations appropriations allotment base Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program
method of distributing funds
description of formula
In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on 1 need as measured by a State 's population and 2 fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita income
The Act further provides for a `` floor `` or minimum allotment set at the 1954 level which is called the `` base `` allotment and a `` ceiling `` or maximum allotment for each State
It stipulates in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the `` ceiling `` and not used for insuring the `` floor `` be redistributed to those States still below their maximums
These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State
The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in operation which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone
Method of computing allotments
The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act
The term `` State `` means the several States the District of Columbia the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico
the term `` United States `` includes the several States and the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii
The following steps are employed in calculations 1
For each State except Puerto Rico Guam the Virgin Islands and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii determine average per capita income based on the last three years
See Source of Data below for per capita income data to be used in this step
2
Determine the average per capita income for the U. S. based on the last three years
See Source of Data below for per capita income data to be used in this step
3
Determine the ratio of 50 to the average per capita income of the U. S. Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above
4
Determine for each State except the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50 as the particular State 's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U. S.
Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above
5
Determine the particular State 's `` allotment percentage ``
By law this is 75 for the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico
Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above
except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-1/3 nor more than 75
If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes the State 's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme
Square each State 's allotment percentage
Determine each State 's population
See Source of Data below for population data to be used in this step
8
Multiply the population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage
Multiply result obtained in item 7 above by result obtained in item 6 above
9
Determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above for all the States
For each State make all computations set forth in items 1 to 8 above and then add the results obtained for each State in item 8
10
Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the States
Divide the amount being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above
11
Determine the particular State 's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year
Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above
12
Determine if the particular State 's unadjusted allotment result obtained in item 11 above is greater than its maximum allotment and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment
Each State 's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds 23,000,000 must be reduced by the amount of the excess
13
Determine if the particular State 's unadjusted allotment result obtained in item 11 above is less than its minimum base allotment and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment
Regardless of its unadjusted allotment each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to 23,000,000
The funds recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used first to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment item 13 above
and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum
Additional note on allotments
For the States which maintain two separate agencies -- one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind -- the Act specifies that their minimum base allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954
Funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine
explanation of matching formula
As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula
Prior to 1960 in order to provide matching for the minimum base allotment State funds had to equal 1954 State funds
Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State with a pivot of 40 State or 60 Federal participation in total program costs
The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State 's `` Federal share ``
For purposes of this explanation this percentage is referred to as the State 's `` unadjusted Federal share ``
Beginning in 1960 the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted upward or downward as required 25 a year so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40 pivot State share with maximum and minimum State shares of 50 and 30 respectively
The pre-1960 rate of Federal participation with respect to any State 's base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 1962 period is designated by the statute as that State 's `` adjusted Federal Share ``
The provisions for determining a State 's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States
The purpose of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates
Method of computing Federal shares
The method used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the Act
The term `` State `` means the several States the District of Columbia the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico
the term `` United States `` includes the several States and the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii
The following steps are employed in the calculations 1
For each State except the Virgin Islands Guam Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii determine the average per capita income for the last three years
the same amount used in item 1 under Method Of Computing Allotments above
2
Determine the average per capita income for the United States for the last three years
The same amount used in item 2 under Method Of Computing Allotments above
3
Determine the ratio of 40 to the average per capita income of the United States
Divide 40 by the amount used in item 2 above
4
Determine for each State except the Virgin Islands Guam Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii that percentage which bears the same ration to 40 as the particular State 's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the United States
Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above
5
Determine the particular State 's `` Federal Share ``
By law this is 70 for the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico
Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above
except that no State shall have a Federal share less than 50 nor more than 70
If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes the State 's Federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme
At the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall
The outside 4-inch space is filled by mortaring blocks on edge
The wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall
Mortar is poured between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding
For details see inset fig 5
The first one or two roof boards marked `` E `` in fig 6 are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside the shelter
These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter
Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards
The roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together
Work on the roof continues in this way
The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter
When the roof blocks are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position
The structure is complete
See fig 7
Building plans are on page 21
Solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense are used for this shelter
These blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit
Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection
Bricks are an alternative
If they are used the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks
The illustrations in fig 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall
More detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen

Aboveground double-wall shelter
An outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks
See fig 9 double-wall shelter
Most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter
Plans are on pages 22 and 23
This shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground shelter
Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart
The space between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth
The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built
The roof shown here fig 9 is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete covered with at least 20 inches of pit-run gravel
An alternate roof perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing
It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel
The materials for a double-wall shelter would cost about 700
Contractors charges would be additional
The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection
Pre-shaped metal shelter
Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground
These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface
They form effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth as shown in figure 10
Materials for this shelter would cost about 700
A contractor probably would be required to help build it
His charges would be added to the cost of materials
This shelter as shown on page 24 would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation
An alternate hatchway entrance shown on page 25 would reduce the cost of materials 50 to 100
The National Lumber Manufacturers Association Washington D. C. is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction
The Structural Clay Products Institute Washington D.C. is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction
Underground concrete shelter
An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about 1,000 to 1,500 depending on the type of entrance
The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection
The illustration fig 11 shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over
The same shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground level
Plans for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance are shown on pages 26 and 27
Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction
It would add about 500 to the total cost of the home
The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington D.C. area in the Spring of 1959
Important considerations common to each type of shelter are 1
Arrangement of the entrance
Radio reception
The entrance must have at least one right-angle turn
Radiation scatters somewhat like light
Some will go around a corner
The rest continues in a straight line
Therefore sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter
Ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance
A blower may be installed to increase comfort
A blower is essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters
It should provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person
Vent pipes also are necessary as shown in figs 9 10 and 11 but filters are not
Radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation
As soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made
It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts
Lighting is an important consideration
Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb
Tests have shown that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days
With a spare battery a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured
A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed
There should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas
Other considerations
-- If there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix page 29
Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens
Basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix page 29
In these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide
Bunks or materials to build them may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed
The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection
Living in a shelter
The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first
Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion
But the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous
Therefore civil defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed
A battery-powered radio is essential
Radiation instruments suitable for home use are available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation
There is a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available
One instrument thus would serve both purposes
Your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources
It will tell you as soon as possible
How long to stay in your shelter
How soon you may go outdoors
How long you may stay outside
You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer
A checklist in the Appendix page 30 tells what is needed
Families with children will have particular problems
They should provide for simple recreation
There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated
Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake
To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy
Records such as diaries can be kept
The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio
A record should be kept of the information and instructions including the time and date of broadcast
Family rationing probably will be necessary
Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule
There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement
However as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum
The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied
Food medical supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it
After the family has settled in the shelter the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge
Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning
Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem
A covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet
A 10-gallon garbage can with a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter
Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully
A portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates
It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning
Even if the electric power fails after an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable
Body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature
Warm clothing and bedding of course are essential
Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided
A flame would use up air
Some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need
If an attack finds you without a prepared shelter
Few areas if any are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about
A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation
On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside
The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house
A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level
The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground
If there is time after the warning the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material
Shelter in apartment buildings
Large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings
In general such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space
The central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling
The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling
The Federal Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide and for how many people
The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space
Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management
A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont 's share of the General Motors market
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted
Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors eight operating divisions
The Fisher Body division long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock followed an independent course for many years but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed `` and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably `` with purchases by other General Motors divisions
Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years but it is `` likely `` that this trend stemmed `` at least in part `` from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont 's capacity
The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest
The inference is overwhelming that Du Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit ``
353 U. S. at 605
This Court agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price quality and service were not overlooked by either Du Pont or General Motors ``
353 U. S. at 606
However it determined that neither this factor nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone including Du Pont 's competitors `` outweighed the Government 's claim for relief
This claim as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it 126 F.Supp.235 alleged violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act
The latter provisions proscribe any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize such trade
However this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations
It rested its decision solely on 7 which reads in pertinent part ``
No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce
This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about the substantial lessening of competition
The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion ``
Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation
The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial lessening of competition have occurred or are intended
'' 353 U. S. at 589
Thus a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision
Indeed as already noted the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly `` and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies
This however did not bar finding that Du Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General Motors
that these products constituted a `` line of commerce `` within the meaning of the Clayton Act
that General Motors share of the market for these products was substantial
and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns ``
The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute
We repeat that the test of a violation of 7 is whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints
The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition
'' 353 U. S. at 607
On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief
The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this ``
The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute
The District Courts in the framing of equitable decrees are clothed with large discretion to model their judgements to fit the exigencies of the particular case
International Salt Co. v. United States 332 U. S. 392 400-401 ``
353 U. S. at 607-608
This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court
This Court 's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 1957
The first pretrial conference -- held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings -- took place on September 25 1957
At the outset the Government 's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court
Du Pont he said had proposed disenfranchisement of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the Du Pont General Motors relationship
The Government deeming these suggestions inadequate had urged that any judgment include divestiture of Du Pont 's shares of General Motors
Counsel for the Government invited Du Pont 's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days
Counsel for Du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date
No previous antitrust case he said had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief
The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract
The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out
The Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25 1957
The plan called for divestiture by Du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders as a dividend over a period of ten years
Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty Investment Company major stockholders in Du Pont and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee again over a ten-year period of Du Pont 's General Motors stock allocable to them as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright
If in the trustee 's judgment `` reasonable market conditions `` did not prevail during any given year he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten-year period
In addition the right to vote the General Motors stock held by Du Pont was to be vested in Du Pont 's stockholders other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware
Du Pont Christiana and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General Motors
Du Pont Christiana and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with General Motors and vice versa
and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont manufactured product or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies
On motion of the Amici Curiae the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government 's plan
On May 9 1958 the Commissioner announced his rulings
The annual dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont 's earnings and profits
The measure for federal income tax purposes of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution
In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or Du Pont 's tax basis for them which is approximately 2.09 per share
The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate
Du Pont 's counterproposal was filed on May 14 1958
Under its plan Du Pont would retain its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares
Christiana and Delaware would in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders
Du Pont would be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors and no director officer or employee of Du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval
Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General Motors distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders
On June 6 1958 General Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal
It argued inter alia that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions
that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies
that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital
and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity
General Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest `` as required by the mandate of this Court
The decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in August of 1958
These plans like Du Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont 's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont Christiana and Delaware except that officers and directors of the three companies their spouses and other people living in their households as well as other specified persons were to be totally disenfranchised
Both plans also prohibited common directors officers or employees between Du Pont Christiana and Delaware on the one hand and General Motors on the other
It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense `` to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship
While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the `` oneness `` of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage
By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States 362 U.S. 525 where the Court held that under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection
One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself
One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage
The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law ``
I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed
But in any event I submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress not to this Court
I dissent

He claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment because 1 at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board and 2 at the trial he was denied the right to have the hearing officer 's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim
Held On the record in this case the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully complied with
petitioner was not denied due process
and his conviction is sustained
Pp 60-66
A
Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings because the statement in question was in his file to which he had access and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board
Pp 62-63
B
Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer 's notes and report especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice 's recommendation to the appeal board
Pp 63-64
C
Petitioner was not entitled either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation since he was furnished a resume of it did not challenge its accuracy and showed no particular need for the original report

This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services in violation of the provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act 62 Stat 604,622 50 U.S.C App Aj 462 A
Petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector contends that he was denied due process both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at trial
He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board and further that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice hearing officer 's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim -- all in violation of the Fifth Amendment
The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents
Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment
The Court of Appeals affirmed
269 F. 2d 613
We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act
361 U. S. 899
We have concluded that petitioner 's claims are controlled by the rationale of Gonzales v. United States 348 U.S. 407 1955 and United States v. Nugent 346 U.S. 1 1953 and therefore affirm the judgment
Petitioner registered with Local Board No 9 Boulder Colorado on March 17 1952
His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah 's Witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer
He claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching
On November 13 1952 he was classified in Class 1-a
On November 22 1952 he wrote the Board protesting this classification
He again stated that he was `` a regular minister ``
that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly `` in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties and that he opposed war in any form
Thereafter he was classified 1-o
On April 1 1953 after some six months of full-time `` pioneering `` petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching but failed to so notify his local board
In a periodic review the local board on July 30 1953 reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home
Upon administrative approval of the reclassification he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 1956 but failed to do so
He was not prosecuted however and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of Sicurella v. United States 348 U.S. 385 1955
He was again reclassified 1-a by the local board
There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing at which petitioner appeared
In his report to the Attorney General the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service
On March 21 1957 however the Department recommended approval of the 1-a classification
Its ground for this recommendation was that while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 1956 as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching the headquarters of the Jehovah 's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and on the contrary had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions
It reported that he now devoted only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities
His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated `` the Department concluded that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith ``
The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation
In his answer thereto he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering `` was in 1952
The appeal board however unanimously concurred in the Department 's recommendation
Upon return of the file to the local board petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so
Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching
But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file
He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer
This he failed to do asserting that he did not know it to be in his file
Apparently he never took the trouble to find out
Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board
After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial
This he did
We found in Gonzales v. United States supra that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant
We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut the Department 's recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification ``
348 U.S. at 412
We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner 's contention which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it
As was said in Gonzales `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered final in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact
Estep v. United States 327 U.S. 114 ``
348 U. S. at 412-413
But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult
At his trial petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the Department 's hearing officer Evensen as well as his report thereon
Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice
He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld
nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose
Section 6 j of the Act as we have held does require the Department 's recommendation to be placed in a registrant 's file
Gonzales v. United States supra
But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer 's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant
While the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file this requirement was eliminated in 1952
Moreover the hearing officer 's report is but intradepartmental is directed to the Attorney General and of course is not the recommendation of the Department
It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice of which the Attorney General receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection
It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board
It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board
Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board
Petitioner knew that the Department 's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file
Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner can not now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed
It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer 's report and notes at the trial
In addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes
While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing `` and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing `` no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process
Moreover his testimony at trial never developed any such facts
In the light of these circumstances as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department 's recommendation which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officer 's report and notes
Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial
He did receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its inaccuracy
Even now no such claim is asserted
He bases his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume
But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent supra
There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system entitles conscientious objectors to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection ``
346 U.S. at 5-6
Even if we were not bound by Nugent petitioner here would not be entitled to the report
The recommendation of the Department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file not on an FBI report
Foreign policy in its total context
With this enlarged role in mind I should like to make a few suggestions What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world
We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context
We can not regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted
Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad
That means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in terms of the total context of our situation
It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense
It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce
We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs `` to resolve differences between this and other departments
Assistant Secretaries of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies
Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy
I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action
Every policy officer can not help but be a planning officer
Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present
The movement of events is so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present
If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs
Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control
There will of course be times for delay and inaction
What I am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties
I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas -- an affliction of all bureaucracies
We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department
We want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top
I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas
The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function regardless of rank
Further I would hope that we could pay attention to little things
While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort
To cite only a few examples The wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy
the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for
Dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world
Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them
I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them
If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas
This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interested responsible fashion
He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country
He is expected to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can
If any official operation abroad begins to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action
The problems of a policy officer
It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government
I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces
This means practically everybody in this room
Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine
The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli an idea in his own head the suggestions of a colleague a question from the Secretary or the President a proposal by another department a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad the filing of an item for the agenda of the United Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies a news item read at the breakfast table a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference a speech by a Senator or Congressman an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad et cetera ad infinitum
The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility
His first thought is about the question itself Is there a question here for American foreign policy and if so what is it
For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer
Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because if no tolerable answer can be found it may have to be changed into one which can be answered
Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can never be complete and the general background much of which has already been lost to history
He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions
He knows that he must give the expert his place but he knows that he must also keep him in it
He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action including doing nothing
He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog
But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy well-established precedents the commitments of the United States under international charters and treaties basic statutes and well-understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers accumulated in the Department
He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted
He must think about which of these principles must take precedence
He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance
He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem
He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it can not be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to grasp
He must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer
Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government
Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice
Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted
What is the probable attitude of other governments including those less directly involved
How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted
If action is indicated what kind of action is relevant to the problem
The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself
Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money be required
Should the action be unilateral or multilateral
Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body
For if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem
Respect for the opinions of mankind
What type of action can hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad
For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it
He is interested in public opinion for two reasons first because it is important in itself and second because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind
And given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support
May I add a caution on this particular point
We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action
In the first place our business is foreign policy and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem
Mr. Truman emphasized this point by saying `` You fellows in the Department of State do n't know much about domestic politics ``
This is an important consideration
If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership
What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership
We can not test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action
I doubt for example that 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals
The problem in the policy officer 's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors -- political military economic financial legal legislative procedural administrative -- to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which can not be under control
And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels
While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women
The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project
There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service
In most cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment
Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States
Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid
The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services
Rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance
Peace Corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living
They should live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption
Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts
Some special health requirements might have to be met
For example it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers
Perhaps existing Public Health Service State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized
For readjustment to the U.S. volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service based on the length of time served
In what part of the government should the Peace Corps be established
The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people
Support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines
The Peace Corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development
For this the Peace Corps should be administered by a small new alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation
Pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the Peace Corps should be established as an agency in the Department of State
When the aid operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous functional unit
Meanwhile the Peace Corps could be physically located in ICA 's facilities and depend on the State Department and ICA for administrative support and when needed program assistance
In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations
How and when should the Peace Corps be launched
The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear with only preparatory work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action with sufficient funds and made available from existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer
The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this year 's graduating classes will not be lost
Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses
If launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall
Within a year or two several thousand might be in service
It can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated
What would the first projects be
In the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects
The need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest
There would however be a variety of other skills -- medical agricultural engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects
The first year 's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America Africa and Asia
How will the Peace Corps be received abroad
Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country
A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters
Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility
But there are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends
It is important however that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community
In presenting it to other governments and to the United Nations we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee
We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands
In any case our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as technician helpers in development projects of the U.N. and other international agencies
The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership
Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach
The Peace Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower
If presented in this spirit the response and the results will be immeasurably better
How will it be financed
The already appropriated funds within the discretion of the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual Security Act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer 's pilot programs of the Peace Corps
If it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security Act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign to the world
Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year
Specifically Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive contributions from American businesses unions civic organizations and the public at large
For this must be the project of the whole American people
An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding
Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus food under P.L 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel
The extent to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies universities international organizations and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored
Is it worth the cost and the risks
No matter how well conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures
These could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad
But as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the Peace Corps is very great
It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions
It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country
It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world
With thousands of young Americans going to work in developing areas millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before
With colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program and with students looking toward Peace Corps service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness
The letters home the talks later given by returning members of the Peace Corps the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world
And this is meeting the world 's need too since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world
The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to America 's world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting
As you said in your State of the Union message `` The problems are towering and unprecedented -- and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well ``
To the Congress of the United States
I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower
I have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis
The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization
In addition by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall
This temporary Peace Corps is being established under existing authority in the Mutual Security Act and will be located in the Department of State
Its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program
Throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires
Our own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty
One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations
The vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge
To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations
This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work
They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice
There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them
Wildlife habitat resources
In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing
Hunter and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses
This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972
The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment
The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are 1
Revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources
Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs including A big-game gamebird and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands B fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments and C participation in planning inspection and control phases of all habitat improvement land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States other Federal agencies and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values
Improve food and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas
Develop wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres
Improve 7,000 miles of fishing streams and 56,000 acres of lakes by stabilizing banks planting streamside cover and constructing channel improvements
The total adverse impact of disease insects fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized
They kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage values and disrupt uses
The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet
If it were not for the effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952
About 45 percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease 20 percent to insects 17 percent to fire and 18 percent to weather animals and various other causes
These destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows and upon the other renewable forest resources
The long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services
This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations
In addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease
Protection from insects and disease
In the 10-year period it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period
This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection
The work will consist of 1
Intensification of present activities through A quicker more extensive and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks
B more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage
C quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic
The initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated
Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production
The objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed
Initiating a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites
Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses
Protection from fire
It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads
This will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection
An additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation
Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for 1
Expansion modernization and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards
This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort detection skilled fire-fighting crews and equipment use
This will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel
Adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely
Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas
This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration felling snags on 350,000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres and clearing and maintaining 11,000 miles of firebreaks
Protection from other damage
Rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of the most serious infestations of harmful rodents such as porcupines and mice on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands
These areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the National Forests
Approximately 1.8 million acres of rangelands and 9.4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period
Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known
Roads and trails
The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions
This system is divided into a forest highway system administered by the Secretary of Commerce and a forest development road and trail system administered by the Secretary of Agriculture
Both of these systems are essential for the production development and use of the National Forests
In the forest highway system there are now 24,400 miles of public roads
These are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another
Because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed
It is estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests
In the forest development road and trail system there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails
These roads are largely of less than highway standards and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests
Construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture
It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development roads and 80,000 miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis
The ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection
It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds
The presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as A
the protection of forage timber and wildlife resources from fire insects and disease
B
the balanced use of recreation hunting and fishing areas
C
the volume of timber that can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises
D
the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects and disease
E
the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals
The existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible
Furthermore roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years
Use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve
The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services
For the year 2000 this means servicing A the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year B recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors C a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet and D 60 million acres of rangelands
Service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails
About 26,500 miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads
About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year 2000
Program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows 1
Complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails
This constitutes about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities
Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices
Provide maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period
Land adjustment land purchase land use
Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular
In some units National Forest ownership is well blocked together
In many others the previous patenting of land under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership
Within exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership
One consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land
Some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands
And some which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and are contributing nothing to the economy
there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed
Lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern States
The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands
Strategy and tactics of the U.S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history
The change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care mindful that the one type of warfare can not be safely neglected in favor of the other
Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war
Forces and military personnel strength
-- This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and women in the active forces
The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870,000 men
a Navy of 817 active ships and 619,000 men
a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000 men
and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000 men
If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces
Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers
Under modern conditions this is especially true of the ready reserve
I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare
Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve
Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped
I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity
I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000 respectively to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961
These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives
Military personnel costs
-- About 30 of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel
These expenditures are estimated to be 12.1 billion an increase of 187 million over 1960 reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay and social security tax increases effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960
Retired pay costs are increased by 94 million in 1961 over 1960 partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel
These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961
Traditionally rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel
The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6 increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 1958
I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates
Operation and maintenance
-- Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be 10.3 billion in 1961 which is 184 million more than in 1960
The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment
A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential
Also the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures
Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year
Other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up 11 in two years and of each steaming hour up 15
In total these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces
In the budget message for 1959 and again for 1960 I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 1951 65 Stat 365
This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
As I have stated previously the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles
Accordingly if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise
Basic long-line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army Air Force and Federal Aviation Agency
The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met as they have in other States through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise
Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government-owned systems in Alaska and its early enactment is desirable
Procurement research and construction
-- Approximately 45 of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement research development and construction programs
In 1961 these expenditures are estimated at 18.9 billion compared to 19.3 billion in 1960
The decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles guns and electronic devices
Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960
New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement excluding amounts for related research and construction totals 4,753 million which is 1,390 million below that enacted for 1960
On the other hand the new authority of 3,825 million proposed for missile procurement excluding research and construction in 1961 is 581 million higher than for 1960
These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead
The Department of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items
As I have repeatedly stated this provision is much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the Buy American Act
I urge once again that the Congress not reenact this rider
The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress
The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history
Some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under development
Furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system in itself often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems
This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events
Thus in the last few years a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated
For example the importance of the Regulus 2 a very promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines
Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid-1960 's
The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles
Considering the high cost of the F-108 system -- over 4 billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to stop further work on the project
Meanwhile other air defense forces are being made effective as described later in this message
The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans
Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed produced and deployed but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile
The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program
This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft particularly our heavy bombers
Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program
As a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed
These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology
The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it
Strategic forces
-- The deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war
The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers carrier-based aircraft and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles
The second capability is represented by our deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement
The Strategic Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability
One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 a long-range supersonic bomber
This aircraft which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier
The first Atlas ICBM 's are now operational the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year and the first Titan ICBM 's next year
The Minuteman solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963
By 1965 several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established
Thus the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful
However I am recommending that development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines be continued
It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing
By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system
I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 the B-52H with the new turbofan engine and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case
These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers
one B-52 can do the work of several B-47 's which it will replace
Funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile
In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas Titan and Polaris missiles also will be procured
Purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities including the classes types and/or varieties of food grain the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees accruing from such sale and other relevant matters
The United States recognizes the desire of India to accumulate as quickly as possible a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal markets for this commodity in India
Under this Agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960
At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 disposal India 's production consumption and stocks of food grains other imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United States India 's storage capacity and other related factors any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed which is currently planned for procurement during the first year
The two Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30 1961 shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 of the Act at that time
The United States Government shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales under this Agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time after June 30 1961 that such action is necessitated by the existence of an international emergency
Article 2 uses of rupees
The two Governments agree that the rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement will be used by the Government of the United States of America in such manner and order of priority as the Government of the United States of America shall determine for the following purposes in the amounts shown A
For United States expenditures under subsections A B D E F H through R of Section 104 of the Act or under any of such subsections the rupee equivalent of 200 million
B
For grant to the Government of India under subsection E of Section 104 of the Act the rupee equivalent of not more than 538 million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may from time to time be mutually agreed
C
For loan to the Government of India under subsection G of Section 104 of the Act the rupee equivalent of not more than 538 million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may be mutually agreed
The terms and conditions of the loan and other provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two Governments
In the event that agreement is not reached on the use of the rupees for grant or loan purposes within six years from the date of this Agreement the Government of the United States of America may use the local currency for any purposes authorized by Section 104 of the Act
In the event the total of rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement is different from the rupee equivalent of 1,276 million the amounts available for the purposes specified in paragraph 1 Article 2 will be adjusted proportionately
Article 3 deposit of rupees
The deposit of rupees to the account of the Government of the United States of America in payment for the commodities and for ocean transportation costs financed by the Government of the United States of America except excess costs resulting from the requirement that United States flag vessels be used shall be made at the rate of exchange for United States dollars generally applicable to import transactions excluding imports granted a preferential rate in effect on the dates of dollar disbursement by United States banks or by the Government of the United States of America as provided in the purchase authorizations
Article 4 general undertakings
The Government of India agrees that it will take all possible measures to prevent the resale or transshipment to other countries or the use for other than domestic purposes except where such resale transshipment or use is specifically approved by the Government of the United States of America of the surplus agricultural commodities purchased pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and to assure that the purchase of such commodities does not result in increased availability of these or like commodities for export from India
The two Governments agree that they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases of surplus agricultural commodities pursuant to the Agreement will not displace usual marketings of the United States of America in these commodities or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries
In carrying out this Agreement the two Governments will seek to assure to the extent practicable conditions of commerce permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural commodities
The Government of India agrees to furnish upon request of the United States of America information on the progress of the program particularly with respect to the arrival and condition of commodities and the provisions for the maintenance of usual marketings and information relating to exports of the same or like commodities
Article 5 consultation
The two Governments will upon the request of either of them consult regarding any matter relating to the application of this Agreement or to the operation of arrangements carried out pursuant to this Agreement
Article 6 entry into force
The agreement shall enter into force upon signature

S. K. Patil Excellency
I have the honor to refer to the Agricultural Commodities Agreement signed today between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of India hereinafter referred to as the Agreement and with regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 of the Agreement to state that the understanding of the Government of the United States of America is as follows 1
With respect to Article 2 Paragraph 1 A of the Agreement 1
The Government of India will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent of 4 million up to a maximum of 1 million per year accruing under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes into currencies other than United States dollars on request of the Government of the United States of America
This facility is needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market development activities of the Government of the United States in other countries
The Government of the United States of America may utilize rupees in India to pay for goods and services including international transportation needed in connection with market development and other agricultural projects and activities in India and other countries
2
The rupee equivalent of 63.8 million but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the Agreement will be used for loans to be made by the Export-Import Bank of Washington under Section 104 E of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act as amended hereinafter referred to as the Act and for administrative expenses of the Export-Import Bank of Washington in India incident thereto
It is understood that A
Such loans under Section 104 E of the Act will be made to United States business firms and branches subsidiaries or affiliates of such firms in India for business development and trade expansion in India and to United States firms and to Indian firms for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization distribution or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets for United States agricultural products
In the event the rupees set aside for loans under Section 104 E of the Act are not advanced within six years from the date of this Agreement because the Export-Import Bank of Washington has not approved loans or because proposed loans have not been mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government of India the Government of the United States of America may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by Section 104 of the Act
B
Loans will be mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Government of India acting through the Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance
The Secretary Department of Economic Affairs or his designate will act for the Government of India and the President of the Export-Import Bank of Washington or his designate will act for the Export-Import Bank of Washington
C
Upon receipt of an application which the Export-Import Bank is prepared to consider the Export-Import Bank will inform the Department of Economic Affairs of the identity of the applicant the nature of the proposed business the amount of the proposed loan and the general purposes for which the loan proceeds would be expended
D
When the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application it will so notify the Department of Economic Affairs and will indicate the interest rate and the repayment period which would be used under the proposed loan
The interest rate will be similar to those prevailing in India on comparable loans and the maturities will be consistent with the purposes of the financing
E
Within sixty days after the receipt of notice that the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application the Department of Economic Affairs will indicate to the Export-Import Bank whether or not the Department of Economic Affairs has any objection to the proposed loan
Unless within the sixty-day period the Export-Import Bank has received such a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs it shall be understood that the Department of Economic Affairs has no objection to the proposed loan
When the Export-Import Bank approves or declines the proposed loan it will notify the Department of Economic Affairs
With respect to Article 2 paragraphs 1 B and 1 C Uses of Section 104 E and Section 104 G rupees The Government of India will use the amount of rupees granted or loaned to it by the United States pursuant to paragraphs 1 B and 1 C for projects to promote economic development with emphasis upon the agricultural sector including food reserve storage structures and facilities as may from time to time be agreed upon by the authorized representatives of the United States and the authorized representatives of the Government of India in the following sectors A
Agriculture
Industry including the production of fertilizer irrigation and power transport and communications and credit institutions
Public health education and rehabilitation
Other economic development projects consistent with the purposes of Sections 104 E and 104 G of the Act
The Government of India further agrees in cooperation with the Government of the United States to coordinate the use of grant and loan funds provided for in paragraphs 1 B and 1 C of Article 2 with such direct dollar assistance as may be made available by the Government of the United States of America so that both sources of financing may be channeled to specific and clearly identifiable economic development programs and projects
It is agreed that any goods delivered or services rendered after the date of this agreement for projects within categories A B and C under paragraph 2 above which may later be approved by the United States will be eligible for financing from currency granted or loaned to the Government of India
With regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 of the Agreement the understanding of the Government of the United States of America with respect to both paragraphs 1 B and 1 C of Article 2 is as follows 1
Local currency will be advanced or reimbursed to the Government of India for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1 B and 1 C of Article 2 of the Agreement upon the presentation of such documentation as the United States may specify
2
The Government of India shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 B and 1 C of Article 2 of the Agreement to disclose the use thereof in the projects and to record the progress of the projects including the cost thereof
The books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained for the duration of the project or until the expiration of three years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the United States whichever is later
The two Governments shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and all other documents correspondence memoranda and other records involving transactions relating to agreed projects
The Government of India shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and services financed under the projects and shall furnish to the United States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto
This broad delegation leaves within our discretion subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided
The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast AM band from 540 kc to 1600 kc
Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of the other
The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors among the principal ones being the distance between the stations their respective radiated power and of particular significance here the time of day
Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others
With the existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances
Rather such assignments are made as they must be on the basis of certain overall rules and standards representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem taking into account for each situation some of the variables e.g power and station separations and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation
An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable
By this standard it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A 's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B 's signal at that point
The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service
A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies
This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere
All AM stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals at all hours
but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are in general negligible
But during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility of one station 's rendering service via skywave at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies
Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band with many more stations operating during the day than at night
It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous process but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise
During the period of about 4 hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail
during the same period around sunrise skywave transmission is declining until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance
However in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions
It was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose
Accordingly the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations
Class 2 stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset for daytime class 2 stations or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 station where located west of the class 2 station for limited-time class 2 stations
The same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 stations operating on regional channels which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other
With respect to nighttime assignments the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves figs 1 and 2 of sec 3.190 of the rules giving average skywave values
These curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data
It was recognized that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength
For this reason the more uncertain skywave service was denominated `` secondary `` in our rules as compared to the steadier more reliable groundwave `` primary service `` and for both skywave service and skywave interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service 10 percent of the time for skywave interference
As mentioned the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations
The rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation
Our objectives as we have stated many times are -- 1
To provide some service to all listeners
2
To provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible

To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible
Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others
Accordingly the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations
Some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 -- A or Class 1 -- B clear-channel stations designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and at night skywave -- over large areas and at great distances being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective
In dealing with these frequencies the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was predominant
the other objectives were subordinated to it
The class 1 stations on these clear channels are protected to their 0.1-mv./m groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference
With respect to skywave service rendered at night class 1 -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 -- A operation and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received
class 1 -- B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv./m 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference
Since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference only class 1 stations are capable of rendering skywave service
But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it
With respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local and assigned for use by class 3 and class 4 stations respectively stations operating generally with lower power
In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible
As mentioned the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference
During nighttime hours because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it
Therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of these channels no station other than the dominant class 1 -- A station is permitted to operate at night so that the 1 -- A station can render service interference free wherever it can be received
On the remainder of the clear channels the dominant class 1 -- B stations are protected as described above and the relatively small number of secondary class 2 stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate directionally and/or with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 stations
In the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels
Additional class 2 assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 stations or to each other and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities
Such additional daytime class 2 assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them
Similarly on the regional channels many class 3 stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power
Essentially the question presented for decision in the present Daytime Skywave proceeding is whether our decision in 1938-1939 to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset is sound as a basis for AM allocations or whether in the light of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours
The history of the proceeding
The decision reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof
Since then there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena
In 1947 affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours from class 2 stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference
If you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax Table and later find you should have itemized your deductions you may do so by filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund
See You May Claim A Refund Page 135
The same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table
The words amended return should be plainly written across the top of such return
When and where to file
April 15 is usually the final date for filing income tax returns for most people because they use the calendar year ending on December 31
If you use a fiscal year a year ending on the last day of any month other than December your return is due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of your tax year
Saturday Sunday or holiday
If the last day due date for performing any act for tax purposes such as filing a return or making a tax payment etc falls on Saturday Sunday or a legal holiday you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday
Since April 15 1962 is on Sunday your return for the calendar year 1961 will be timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday April 16 1962
If you mail A return or tax payment you must place it in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before the due date
Declaration of estimated tax
If you were required to file a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year 1961 it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 15 1962 if you file your income tax return Form 1040 and pay your tax in full for the calendar year 1961 by January 31 1962
The filing of an original or amended declaration otherwise due on January 15 1962 is also waived if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and pay the full tax by January 31 1962
Farmers for these purposes have until February 15 1962 to file Form 1040 and pay the tax in full for the calendar year 1961
Fiscal year taxpayers have until the last day of the first month following the close of the fiscal year farmers until the 15th day of the 2d month
See Chapter 38
Nonresident aliens living in Canada or Mexico who earn wages in the United States may be subject to withholding of tax on their wages the same as if they were citizens of the United States
Their United States tax returns are due April 16 1962
However if their United States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages their returns are due June 15 1962 if they use a calendar year or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of their fiscal year
Nonresident aliens in Puerto Rico
If you are a nonresident alien and a resident of Puerto Rico your return is also due June 15 1962 or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of your fiscal year
If A taxpayer dies the executor administrator or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the deceased taxpayer 's normal tax year
Suppose John Jones who for 1960 filed on the basis of a calendar year died June 20 1961
His return for the period January 1 to June 20 1961 is due April 16 1962
The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax
In such a case Form 1310 should be completed and attached to the return
This form may be obtained from the local office of your district director
Returns of estates or trusts are due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the tax year
Extensions of time for filing
Under unusual circumstances a resident individual may be granted an extension of time to file a return
You may apply for such an extension by filing Form 2688 Application For Extension Of Time To File with the District Director of Internal Revenue for your district or you may make your application in a letter
Your application must include the following information 1 your reasons for requesting an extension 2 whether you filed timely income tax returns for the 3 preceding years and 3 whether you were required to file an estimated return for the year and if so whether you did file and have paid the estimated tax payments on or before the due dates
Any failure to file timely returns or make estimated tax payments when due must be fully explained
Extensions are not granted as a matter of course and the reasons for your request must be substantial
If you are unable to sign the request because of illness or other good cause another person who stands in close personal or business relationship to you may sign the request on your behalf stating the reason why you are unable to sign
You should make any request for an extension early so that if it is refused your return may still be on time
See also Interest On Unpaid Taxes below
Extensions while abroad
Citizens of the United States who on April 15 are not in the United States or Puerto Rico are allowed an extension of time until June 15 for filing the return for the preceding calendar year
An extension of 2 months beyond the regular due date for filing is also available to taxpayers making returns for a fiscal year
Alaska and Hawaii
Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also allowed this extension of time for filing but those residing or traveling in Hawaii are not allowed this automatic extension
Military or Naval Personnel on duty in Alaska or outside the United States and Puerto Rico are also allowed this automatic extension of time for filing their returns
You must attach a statement to your return if you take advantage of this automatic extension showing that you were in Alaska or were outside the United States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date
Interest on unpaid taxes
Interest at the rate of 6 a year must be paid on taxes that are not paid on or before their due date
Such interest must be paid even though an extension of time for filing is granted
When payment is due
If your computation on Form 1040 or Form 1040A shows you owe additional tax it should be remitted with your return unless you owe less than 1 in which case it is forgiven
If payment is by cash you should ask for a receipt
If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax you will be sent a bill if additional tax is due
This bill should be paid within 30 days
Payment by check or money order
Whether the check is certified or uncertified the tax is not paid until the check is paid
If the check is not good and the April 15 or other due date deadline elapses additions to the tax may be incurred
Furthermore a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalties
All checks and money orders should be made payable to Internal Revenue Service
An overpayment of income and social security taxes entitles you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the overpayment should be applied to your succeeding year 's estimated tax
If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax any refund to which you are entitled will be mailed to you
If you file a Form 1040 you should indicate in the place provided that there is an overpayment of tax and the amount you want refunded and the amount you want credited against your estimated tax
Refunds of less than 1 will not be made unless you attach a separate application to your return requesting such a refund
Where to file
Send your return to the Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which you have your legal residence or principal place of business
If you have neither a legal residence nor a principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district your return should be filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue Baltimore 2 Md
If your principal place of abode for the tax year is outside the United States including Alaska and Hawaii Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands and you have no legal residence or principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district in the United States you should file your return with the Office of International Operations Internal Revenue Service Washington 25 D.C.
Adjusted gross income
The deductions allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on a comparable basis
It is the amount you enter on line 9 page 1 of Form 1040
Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to determine Adjusted Gross Income
Other deductions are subtracted only from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving at Taxable Income
To compute your adjusted gross income you total all items of income
See Chapter 6
From this amount deduct the items indicated below
Businessmen deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses attributable to a trade or business
Rents or royalties
If you hold property for the production of rents or royalties you subtract in computing Adjusted Gross Income ordinary and necessary expenses and certain other deductions attributable to the property
See Chapter 15
Outside salesmen deduct all expenses attributable to earning a salary commission or other compensation
See Chapter 10
Employees deduct expenses of travel meals and lodging while away from home in connection with the performance of their services as employees
They also deduct transportation expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services as employees even though they are not away from home
See Chapter 12
If your employer reimburses you for expenses incurred you deduct such expenses if they otherwise qualify
See Chapter 10
Sick pay if included in your Gross Income is deducted in arriving at Adjusted Gross Income
If your sick pay is not included in your Gross Income you may not deduct it
See Chapter 9
income from estates and trusts
If you are a life tenant you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion
If you are an income beneficiary of property held in trust or an heir legatee or devisee you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion if not deductible by the estate or trust
Deductible losses on sales or exchanges of property are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income
See Chapter 20
50 of capital gains
You also deduct 50 of the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses in determining Adjusted Gross Income
See Chapter 24
other deductions
Certain other deductions are not allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income
They may be claimed only by itemizing them on page 2 of Form 1040
These deductions may not be claimed if you elect to use the Standard Deduction or Tax Table
See Chapters 30 through 37
Minors minors must also file returns if they earn 600 or more during the year
A minor is subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may under local law have the right to them and might actually have received the money
His income is not required to be included in the return of his parent
A minor child is allowed A personal exemption of 600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn
Exemption also allowed parent
If your child is under 19 or is a student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualifies as your dependent even though he earns 600 or more
See Chapter 5
Your 16 year old son earned 720 in 1961
You spent 800 for his support
Since he had gross income of 600 or more he must file a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of 600
Since you contributed more than half of his support you may also claim an exemption for him on your return
He may get a tax refund
A minor who has gross income of less than 600 is entitled to a refund if income tax was withheld from his wages
Generally the refund may be obtained by filing Form 1040A accompanied by the withholding statement Form W-2
If he had income other than wages subject to withholding he may be required to file Form 1040
See Chapter 1
If your child works for you you may deduct reasonable wages you paid to him for services he rendered in your business
You may deduct these payments even though your child uses the money to purchase his own clothing or other necessities which you are normally obligated to furnish him and even though you may be entitled to his services
The one- or two-season hunt of which there have been too many recently may do more harm than good
for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued
and they are dashed no less by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit
For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time
The central group of the Foundation 's advisors are at any one period of time the members of our Advisory Board consisting now of thirty-six men and women
They are chosen by the Foundation 's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts
Their locations in all parts of the United States and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees minds
For this concept of an Advisory Board ancillary to the Board of Trustees we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University A. Lawrence Lowell a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration
That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr. Lowell 's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been it may be said truly pretty uniformly good
For in accordance with Mr. Lowell 's concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices
And lest we should become too consistent in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts the Foundation 's Board of Trustees maintains a trickle -- not a flow
-- of new members through the Advisory Board
Two committees of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection -- one for the selection of Fellows from Canada the United States and the English-speaking Caribbean area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American republics and the Republic of the Philippines
To the members of our Advisory Board and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection the Foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of Fellows
We are as we know utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get
and quality of advice added to devotion to the Foundation 's purposes and ideals we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day
But the facts about our Advisory Board and its members duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative on which to base our selections of Fellows
For example the interest of past members of the Foundation 's Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were formally members of that Board
And besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers of music novelists poets essayists choreographers lawyers servants of government and men of affairs -- hundreds indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience
To all the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are
It is a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management
The same is true of every foundation
During the biennium reviewed in this Report our Board of Trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class administration of the Foundation 's affairs
Dr. James Brown Fisk physicist President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories was elected to the Board of Trustees
He is a member both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society
and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions
Dr. Gordon N. Ray Provost Vice-President and Professor of English in the University of Illinois was appointed Associate Secretary General
The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the latter 's eventual retirement
Dr. Ray is a Fellow of the Foundation -- appointed thrice to assist his studies of William Makepeace Thackeray and of H. G. Wells -- and before his appointment to the Foundation 's executive staff had been given our highest scholarly accolade appointment to the Advisory Board
Referring further to the Foundation 's officers Dr. James F. Mathias for eleven years our discerning colleague as Associate Secretary was promoted to be Secretary
He is a historian with the great merit of a historian 's long view
Also appointed to the Foundation 's staff as Assistant Secretary is Mr. J. Kellum Smith Jr.
Mr. Smith like the present Secretary General is a lawyer
and lawyers -- with the great virtues that they are trained to read `` the fine print `` carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are indispensable even in a foundation office
The present Secretary General has been the Foundation 's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation 's establishment thirty-five years ago
But even he will not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are quite simply made to assure qualitative continuity in the Foundation 's policies and practices
The effective recognition of excellence and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day nor even in a year
We are not given to lamentations neither personally nor in these Reports
On the contrary if this be an apocalyptic era as is commonly said we see it as an era of opportunity
For granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved these problems make great demands
and by their demanding tend to create resources of men 's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth
Of this examples are legion Pericles speaking his funeral oration in Ancient Greece 's extremity after Thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom
Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution
Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount close to his ultimate sacrifice
Shakespeare speaking with `` the indescribable gusto of the Elizabethan voice `` --
Keats 's words -- in the days of the Spanish Armada 's threats
Isaac Newton at the age of twenty-three industriously calculating logarithms `` to two and fifty places `` during the great plague year in England 1665
Winston Churchill 's Olympian optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago
the present-day explorations of outer space answering age-old questions of science and philosophy in the face of possible wars of extinction
Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit as the Roman poet Virgil declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today
It gives indeed cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced
and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind
For example out of the social evils of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens
and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men -- until today -- in the industrialized West these social evils substantially do not exist
The solutions were not arrived at by any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government -- lawyers most of them -- and men of business
These were educated men who as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility
That is to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit or they had to get the votes to get elected
Nevertheless they made naught of Marx 's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers `` -- to use Marx 's word -- more than a subsistence wage with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists pockets with the result in turn that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase
But as all understand who have eyes to see nothing of the kind has happened
indeed the contrary has happened
The gulf between the `` rich `` and the `` poor `` has narrowed in the industrialized Western world to the point that the word `` poor `` is hardly applicable
And the reason this could happen is clear men of government business men lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity
Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit
and even putting it that way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong
Sir Henry Sumner Maine a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with wrote his brilliant legal generalization that `` the progress of society is from status to contract ``
The essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do
Hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice
The greater the range of freedom for individual men the greater the range of choice
the greater the range of choice the greater the rate of change
For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future
But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not can not progress
The eternal truth is that progress -- due as it always is to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart
And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten them with the truths that under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative efforts for the good of mankind
During the year 1959 we granted 354 Fellowships
in 1960 we granted 334
As heretofore our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts
We do not favor one field over another we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic creation is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life as all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation does
Indeed if pressed we would say what the late Robert Henri American painter said to a pupil `` Anything will do for a subject it 's what you do with it that counts ``
Thus we have no part and want none in current discussions of the relative importance of science the social studies the humanities the creative arts
We want no part in such discussions because we think them largely futile
and we think them largely futile because for true excellence of accomplishment every scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view
When the Brown Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world
With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution Brown Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder Joseph R. Brown and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology
Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830
He was early exposed to the mechanical world and in his youth often helped his father David Brown master clock and watchmaker as he plied his trade
At the age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott Harris in Valley Falls Rhode Island and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation he went into business for himself in 1831 making lathes and small tools
This enterprise led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 under the name D. Brown Son a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown Sharpe
The years of Joseph 's partnership with his father were numbered
In 1838 a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois settling on a land grant in his declining years
Joseph Brown continued in business by himself quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world
Much of his genius of course sprang from his familiarity with clock movements
During these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young man 's occupation
He became particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840 's and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period
But his business also grew and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire
It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 1848 Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically cryptic style `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice ``
The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm
the company became `` J. R. Brown Sharpe `` and entered into a new and important period of its development
Mr. Sharpe 's arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering `` and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time
By 1853 the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts
The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine
That development in turn formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting in circular graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement
Throughout their careers both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades
Several efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive to this day the Brown Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today
As one development followed another the company 's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture
In 1858 the partnership began manufacturing the Willcox Gibbs sewing machine
As the story goes Mr. Gibbs who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine
Curious as to what made it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling the crude machine to take stitches
When he showed this model as his `` solution `` as to how the Howe sewing machine operated he was told he was `` wrong `` and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine which was unknown to him in detail used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one
Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture
The new work was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment
The turret screw machine now known as the Brown Sharpe hand screw machine takes its ancestry directly from Mr. Brown 's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine
Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible tap and die holders
In 1861 Mr. Brown 's attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist drills
At that time during the Civil War Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files
This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown 's imagination of the possibilities in the situation
The child of this problem was Mr. Brown 's famous Serial No 1 Universal Milling Machine the archtype from which is descended today 's universal knee-type milling machine used throughout the world
The original machine bearing its famous serial number is still on exhibition at the Brown Sharpe Precision Center in Providence
During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world 's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics
Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth but they were good for only one sharpening
As soon as the time came for re-sharpening the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made
This process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form
Mr. Brown 's invention achieved this and as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of Brown Sharpe 's position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the 1920 's when superceded by other methods
The micrometer caliper as a common workshop tool also owes much to J. R. Brown
Although Mr. Brown was not himself its inventor it was a French idea it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use
So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day
The final achievement of Mr. Brown 's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine
That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition
This machine like its milling counterpart was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world
Along with J. R. Brown 's other major developments the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown Sharpe for many years to come
Following Mr. Brown 's death there came forward in the Brown Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company
One such man was Samuel Darling
As head of the firm Darling Swartz Mr Darling began by challenging Brown Sharpe to its keenest competition during the 1850 's and early 60 's
In 1868 however a truce was called between the companies and the partnership of Darling Brown Sharpe was formed
Between that year and the buying out of Mr Darling 's interest in 1892 a large portion of the company 's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling Brown Sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark
Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown 's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown Sharpe to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world
Also important on the Brown Sharpe scene at the turn of the century was Mr. Richmond Viall Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910
Mr. Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men
He was an ardent champion of the Brown Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company
In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad
Commencing with the death of Lucian Sharpe in 1899 the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company
During his presidency the company 's physical plant was enormously expanded and the length and breadth of the Brown Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world
During the early part of this century the Brown Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world
During these years the company 's product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown
It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines
In the grinding machine field expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders surface grinders and a wide variety of special and semi-special models
In 1951 Henry D. Sharpe Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company 's development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business
The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts
The Machine Tool Division is currently producing Brown Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines grinding machines of many types and knee and bed-type milling machines
Recently added is the Brown Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development
In the Industrial Products Division the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment machinists tools -- including micrometers Vernier calipers and accessories
In the Cutting Tool Division the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters end mills and saws
Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 1960 showed an improvement over 1959
Net income was 2,557,111 or 3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding as compared to 2,323,867 or 2.82 per share in 1959 adjusted to the same number of shares
Sales and other operating income increased 25.1 from 24,926,615 in 1959 to 31,179,816 in 1960
This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development
In spite of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959
Outlook for current year
Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960
However the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961
Need for sound tax policy
In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis could if adopted have favorable effects on Leesona 's business in the next few years
Such a depreciation policy would also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange
Research and development
Our research and development program serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona
This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money
Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment in terms of efficiency and versatility
But more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine
On this basis our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona 's future growth in sales and earnings
Much of this necessary increase in research and development though properly chargeable to current expenses is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity usually over a period of several years
Stretch yarn machines
In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines
These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics
During the past year great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics
Fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved `` wash and wear `` dresses and blouses made from these fabrics
This machine operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today
It transfers yarn directly from the producers largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics
Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers mills
Later in the year additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns
These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds larger yarn packages and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn
This we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment
Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine
This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year
This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry
The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder
The Uniconer has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment
it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted
Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production at the same time upgrading quality
Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine
New Unifil application
A new application for the Unifil loom winder running single filling for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment
A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns
It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed
This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute
It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time
Our take-up machines and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high polymer yarns in several fiber producing plants
We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field
We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction
Patterson Moos research
Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells
The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee Pratt Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation has been important in this work
In addition to its major effort on fuel cells Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields both under contract for the Defense Department other government agencies and for our own account
PMR is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs
We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil CSF of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials
The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States
Initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country
There is a rapidly growing demand for this material primarily from the military
Further research we believe will develop important commercial applications
A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases
We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity
The rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation
Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities
New plant facilities
Early in August we broke ground for a new 3,500,000 plant in Warwick Rhode Island which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations
Construction is well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year
All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick
Operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962
An architect 's sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover
The building will contain 430,000 square feet approximately the same as our present plant
However its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs
A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site four miles from Cranston was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force
We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant
During the year our British subsidiary Leesona-Holt Limited expanded its plant in Darwen England and added machine tool capacity
The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona 's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood
Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis
The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations
In addition land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future
The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction
It will be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island a non-profit organization which will reimburse us for the cost of construction
We will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase
These arrangements are in our opinion very favorable to Leesona
Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank
In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant we have invested approximately 1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt Limited
We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment
Long term loans have been reduced by 395,000 to 2,461,000
Inventories increased 625,561 to 8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months
Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position
In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May 1959 with the International Association of Machinists AFL-CIO wages of hourly employees were increased by 4 in May 1960 and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately
In addition Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations
In addition to direct salaries and wages the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees
During the pension year ended December 31 1960 23 employees retired making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company 's pension plan
At December 13 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan totaled 2,412,616
The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago
Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living
As in many other industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years
In textiles as elsewhere a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity
As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility
Problems of shifting styles
The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration
Production must be adjusted accordingly at minimum cost and quickly
In addition production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics as well as blends
Following the term of service in Japan each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community

In recent months much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future
And yet despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade 1960 has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole
The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle
This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level
In the electronics industry this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets
Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below 1959
The total value of our industry 's shipments at factory prices increased from 9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately 10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment military industrial and replacement
I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961
Home entertainment sales up
Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about 1.9 billion compared to 1.7 billion in 1959
Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July
set production excluding those destined for the export market also ran ahead in the early months but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic
For the year as a whole retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959
however production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million
In contrast to the lower turnout of TV total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million excluding export
Both home and auto radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven
sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units
Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959
Separate phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market
The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods
I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 15 but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will
I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 15.5 million sets
I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about 1.8 million slightly below 1960 but above 1959
Military electronics to grow
1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry 's shipments of military electronics which totalled about 5.4 billion compared to 4.9 billion in 1959
It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry 's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance
It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15 or better that characterized the decade of the 1950 's and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability
While this may well be true in general I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions
Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command and improved battlefield surveillance systems
Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially
Research development test and evaluation funds devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963
Still later the realm of space technology will show substantial gains
it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than 500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than 2 billion by 1967 and that the electronic industry 's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50 than the current 20
The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional 2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962
Although the impact of these increases on our industry 's shipments will be gradual on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year to at least 6 billion
Industrial electronic equipment
Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled 1.8 billion compared to 1.6 billion in 1959
The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30 annually reaching some 450 million in 1960
Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960 's under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information storage and retrieval
In the industrial field prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright
For the near term however it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years
sales should slightly exceed 1960 however and reach 1.9 billion
In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year
This is now a 1.0 billion business up from 0.9 billion in 1959 and should reach 1.1 billion in 1961
The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry
Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates
In the military field incoming orders turned down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components
Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded 300 million compared to 222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types
Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately 380 million in 1961
Sales of passive components such as capacitors and resistors although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 1959 this year and should increase again in 1961
In sum I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 with total sales increasing about 7 to 10.8 billion despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally
As I have indicated above I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960
on prospects for continued increases in defense spending
and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960 's
The appointment of Gilbert B. Devey as General Manager of VecTrol Engineering Inc. of Stamford Connecticut a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls has been announced by David B. Peck Vice President Special Products
Mr. Devey will be responsible for the commercial expansion of VecTrol 's line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers working closely with Walter J Brown President and Director of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary
Mr. Brown will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol 's custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff
Mr. Devey 's new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of Sprague 's Special Products Group which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components packaged component assemblies and high temperature magnet wires
Mr. Devey first came to Sprague in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington D. C. where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies
During World War 2 he was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy
Mr. Devey is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and attended the United States Naval Academy Post-Graduate School specializing in electronic engineering
He was named Product Manager of the Special Products Division of Sprague when it was founded in 1958 and was later promoted to his present post
Mr. Devey is a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers and is chairman of the Electronic Industries Association Committee on Printed and Modular Components
Mr. Brown well-known English-born inventor prior to founding VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co. Ltd.
chief engineer of the radio set division of Electric and Musical Industries Ltd. the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain
director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain Ltd. and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at The Brush Development Co. Cleveland Ohio
He has a Bachelor of Science from the University of Manchester England
Mr. Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers
He is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers London a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio and a chartered electrical engineer in Great Britain
The promotion of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough Manager of Interference Control Field Service
The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems
Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters
Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both jobs
Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course
The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship
The president expects faculty members to remember in exercising their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility for the university 's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions
He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he has a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the administration
How well do faculty members govern themselves
There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government
They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government
They too need to learn to delegate
Letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention
Although faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government
There are nevertheless several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege
He can for example present significant university-wide issues to the senate
He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty
by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments
by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration
by minimizing the number of committees
Despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack of communication persist
The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose
A busy president conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is
The need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation
To increase faculty influence and decrease tension many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly
The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes but if he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas he can open the way for innovation and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take
Success will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and persistence
The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands
Great professors do not automatically reproduce themselves
Deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty
They serve not only as spokesmen for their areas but they also contribute to top-level decision making
The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance
Faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration
The administration at the same time looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments
One way that this can be done other than by hiring new high-priced professors is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance
The quality of a president 's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty
By supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership
Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to
The academic dean should take a direct long-term interest in faculty development
An alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job and bright prospects elsewhere
For the maintenance of a long-term program the departments and particularly their chairmen are strategic
They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and promotion
To provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly
At some colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates
Some faculty members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat department 's actions or act pro forma
They can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work
At one university the president cites the faculty review committee as `` a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty ``
Before the president recommends a candidate to the trustees the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere
The president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind
No good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria
To avoid passing over quiet unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments
There are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly
He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man 's former achievements
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different
In particular the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale
On those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action
A true university like most successful marriages is a unity of diversities Without forcing all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level which a university -- in contrast to a multiversity -- should stand for
Recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals
Each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as Shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates
Or shall we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subjects
In the first instance adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned
In the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required
For the president a master plan looking ahead five years the maximum reach for sound forecasting offers several practical advantages
Trustees faculty and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards
Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed
Proposed new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present and future financial fitness
More than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts
It inspires confidence in his institution 's determination to establish goals and to achieve them
Before deciding where it is going however a college or university must know where it is
The first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination of the two
It should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in stature and size
Implementation of the master plan will inevitably be uneven
Some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically
others may drag their feet
Funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others
A plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer
To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research
Some offices have very broad responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a university 's instructional program
Their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations
More often these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data
The president 's opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts
No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents
When the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president 's budget to which his faith and credit are committed
its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment
He can not of course examine each proposal from scratch
He reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution
Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship
Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money an institution should choose its fields of prominence
Otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning
In the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses in all branches
Supporting activities -- business management public relations fund-raising -- offer presidents one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education
Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role
In the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention
The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them
Higher education can not compete with the salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income
Just as the entire faculty should know the president 's educational philosophy and objectives so should non-academic officers
They will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals
A president is frequently besieged to serve in non-academic civic and governmental capacities to make speeches to lay groups and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus
Since he can neither accept nor reject them all he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations
Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance
By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution something more than the lengthened shadow of one man
Assembly session brought much good
The General Assembly which adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened
It was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education
There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers
The final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need
Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government
This session for instance may have insured a financial crisis two years from now
In all the turmoil some good legislation was passed
Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action
Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue
No action has been taken however on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales
Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state
The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions
Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like anything but `` the empire state of the South ``
We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation
In the interim between now and next year we trust the House and Senate will put their minds to studying Georgia 's very real economic fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics
League regularly stands on the side of right
The League of Women Voters 40 now and admitting it proudly is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive
It 's a good use of money
These women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson 's dictum that one must cherish the people 's spirit but `` Keep alive their attention ``
`` If once they become inattentive to the public affairs `` Jefferson said `` you and I and Congress and assemblies judges and governors shall all become wolves ``
Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs
The league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public
The harder the choice the more willing the league is to wade in
And the league takes a stand with great regularity on the side of right
Look to Coosa Valley for industrial progress
Cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that are members of the Coosa Valley Area Planning and Development Commission
Coupling its own budget of 83,750 with a 30,000 state grant authorized by Gov Vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech
Then a full-time planning office will be established in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program
The undertaking has abundant promise
It recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach
Rusk idea strengthens United States defense
The Rusk belief in balanced defense replacing the Dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that has existed
The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs would deter Russia 's use of hers
that theory was and is sound
The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough
By limiting American strength too much to nuclear strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war
This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war
It also weakened our diplomatic stance because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity
This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity
By maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing American military forces to fight conventional wars too Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position
DeKalb budget shows county is on beam
DeKalb 's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance
It includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and road maintenance
That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed and other county officials
Somewhere somebody is bound to love us
G. Mennen Williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly
Touring Africa the new U.S. Assistant Secretary of State observed `` Africa should be for the Africans `` and the British promptly denounced him
Then he arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying signs saying `` American imperialists go home ``
Chin up Soapy
Power company backs confidence with dollars
Confidence in the state 's economic future is reflected in the Georgia Power Company 's record construction budget for this year
The firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning
It is good to know that Georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization
Georgia 's mental health program received a badly needed boost from the General Assembly in the form of a 1,750,000 budget increase for the Milledgeville State Hospital
Actually it amounts to 1,250,000 above what the institution already is receiving considering the additional half-million dollars Gov Vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus
Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is
But exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing
The practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished
The work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced
More attendants nurses and doctors should be hired
Patients deserve more attention than they are getting
Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year Georgia will be spending only around 3.15 per day per patient
The national average is more than 4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low
Kansas regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill spends 9 per day per patient
Georgia has made some reforms true
The intensive treatment program is working well
But in so many other areas we still are dragging
Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted
The boost is helpful but inadequate
The end of Trujillo
Assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive to men of good conscience
Rafael Trujillo the often blood-thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history
But whether the murder of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that can not now be answered
Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination
The responsibility for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez a professor at Columbia University in New York has been laid at his door
He had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela
It was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez has been uncovered and quashed
The recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive
Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably
But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition
El Benefactor 's vanity grew with his personal wealth
The jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure
He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his influence extended even to Congress
Until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article of faith with Trujillo and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character
Tardily the Government here came to understand how this country 's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression
Last year after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean the United States and many other members of the Organization of American States broke diplomatic relations with him
Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines
Trujillo 's dictatorship had been along conservative right-wing lines
But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans
There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba previously a bete noire to Trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces
What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle
The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been suppressed
Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger
The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom
Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear
For that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help
Start on rapid transit
High-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John Glen Echo and Brookmont would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city
In presenting plans for such express buses before the Montgomery County Council the administrator of the NCTA C. Darwin Stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching
Such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the NCTA are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area
Because the buses would not stop on the parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed
The NCTA is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress
Must Berlin remain divided
The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city
So far as the record is concerned the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so
Though Walter Ulbricht by grace of Soviet tanks may be head man in East Germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone
The wartime protocol of September 12 1944 designated a special `` Greater Berlin `` area comprising the entire city to be under joint occupation
It was not a part of any one of the three later four zones for occupation by Soviet American British and French troops respectively
After the Berlin blockade and airlift the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin ``
For some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas
Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany
That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain France and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter 's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin
The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler
The British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities `` to integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of East Germany ``
They insisted on the `` fundamental fact `` that `` the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status ``
This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact
There remains of course the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts
One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist `` vopos `` try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents
Another remained when an American Army car was recovered but with a broken glass
The glass may seem trivial but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed
Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about `` salami `` tactics it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy 's representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed
Prairie National Park
Thousands of buffalo `` bison `` they will never be to the man on the street grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling dusty-green grassland
A horizon even and seamless binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth
That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood
For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill
The National Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County northeast Kansas as a `` Prairie National Park ``
There the buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as moth-eaten zoo specimens
Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved
Grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them
The Park Service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park
American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve
Whisky on the air
A Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on TV and radio
Starting with small stations not members of the National Association of Broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations
Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal Communications Commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power
The National Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials
Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy
Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific prohibition
Why then with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional action
Simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and TV stations that are not members of the NAB tends to spread
Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors
Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which TV soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him into downing bourbon
A law is needed
New York Democrats choice
Registered Democrats in New York City this year have the opportunity to elect their party 's candidates for Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization
In the central contest that for Mayor they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other
Mayor Robert F. Wagner must as his opponents demand assume responsibility for his performance in office
While all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies
The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record
State Controller Arthur Levitt on the other hand can not effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city 's welfare
They too have links with the city 's ills
Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited
Mayor Wagner 's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of Mr. Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post
As Mayor Mr. Levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like
His election on the other hand would unquestionably strengthen the `` regulars ``
Mr. Wagner might or might not be a `` new `` Mayor in this third term now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls `` bosses ``
These are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote
But his reelection would strengthen the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him
If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish it nevertheless must be made
The vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party
Little war big test
Both Mr. K 's have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos
President Kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow
But at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting
And Secretary Rusk en route to Bangkok doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian or Thai SEATO forces
For Mr. Kennedy speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation
The new President is in no position to start out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs
He must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says
In this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr. Khrushchev for the third time
At his press conference Mr. Kennedy said `` All we want in Laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn ``
At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position
Since Laos is of no more purely military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington this approach might be expected to head off Mr. Khrushchev for the moment
But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog Washington in a tactical mess
As wars go Laos is an extremely little one
Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day
The hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters
But for the United States and its SEATO allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded road-shy guerrilla-th'-wisp terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners
But if anything can bring home to Mr. Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indians contest it will probably be the fact that SEATO forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington
Fortunately both the Republicans and America 's chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos aim of the President
Actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table
It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable
The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954 and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma
But since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers
The road to a guaranteed-neutral coup-proof Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation 's terrain
But for the safety of Southeast Asia and for the sake of the Laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made
The world awaits Mr. Khrushchev 's choice of alternatives
A vote for educational TV
The Senate 's overwhelming 64-13 vote to support locally controlled educational TV efforts should be emulated in the lower house
Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing ETV and the House has let them die
But this year prospects may be better
The House communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds
This year 's Senate measure would provide each state and the District of Columbia with 1,000,000 to be used in support of private state or municipal ETV efforts
The funds would be used for equipment not for land buildings or operation
The relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value
But lacking money from commercial sponsors the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service
Other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment
A good man departs
Goodby Mr. Sam
Sam Rayburn was a good man a good American and third a good Democrat
He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure
Mr. Speaker Mr. Sam and Mr. Democrat at one and the same time
The House was his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth Speaker of the House and second most powerful man in Washington
Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label
He was no flaming liberal yet the New Deal the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him
He was not a rear-looking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any
Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word
Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once given was not subject to retraction
It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs
The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical
His leadership was not for audiences
A growl a nod was usually enough
When it was not one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented
He would rise in the well of the House his chin upon his chest his hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence
He spoke briefly sensibly to the point and without oratorical flourishes
He made good plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it
These public efforts were rare because Mr. Rayburn normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor
He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them
With his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political leader
He was of course in the House for a very long time
There are only two men remaining in Congress who with Rayburn voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917
To almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr. Sam coincided with that of the House
And it was the House he loved
To be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition
The Senate to him was not the `` upper body `` and he corrected those who said he served `` under `` the president
He served `` with `` him
Sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death
Woodrow Wilson with whom he began his years in Washington Warren G. Harding Calvin Coolidge FDR with whom he managed a social revolution
And those still with us Herbert C. Hoover Harry S. Truman Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy
He was a fighter for those of his own party
Mr. Truman has only to recall the `` hopeless `` campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there
As it was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration
With Republican presidents he fought fair
He was his own man not an automatic obstructionist
He kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game he was born to play
Under any name -- Mr. Speaker Mr. Democrat Mr. Sam -- he was a good man
un off the Congo track
Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends
In 18 months no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle
Simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river
The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries
In other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga
Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that UN is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it
To the contrary through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence
Mass rapes troop mutinies uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures given no sanction by any political authority have become almost daily occurrences
Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga
It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as UN support gives it
The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms
The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa
Right now they are pushing a resolution which would have UN use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga
That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view
The UN army is too weak too demoralized for the task
Further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned
Last it makes no sense to deliver Katanga the one reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos
The Congo should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence
The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom
It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism
But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach
Otherwise UN will march blindly on to certain defeat
A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information
The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year
Our comment was that this was `` featherbedding `` in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement
The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life
Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need
Also normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic
The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries
The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands
Meditations from a fallout shelter
Time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side
But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar and when the lads met in St. Louis it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and there
It was the brief writers decided `` man 's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world ``
Peace it 's wonderful and `` world law `` it 's wonderful too and should n't we get an international covenant extending it into space before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon
Meanwhile in Moscow Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of TNT to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who ca n't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism
A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St. Louis to the moon where there would n't even be any beer to drink
While he was at it the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who ca n't appreciate coexistence thru suicide
`` Fools `` he bayed `` what do you think you are doing ``
The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we are n't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort
Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a gun
The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana where for some unknown reason Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock Shadow
The plane was sent back to the United States for a change but Castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution
Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro 's right hand man Che Guevara who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas Venezuela
The contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen who were on hand to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium
Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests these things would not happen
The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April which we trust is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev
Pass the iron rations please and light another candle for it 's getting dark down here and we 're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away
The customer loses again
The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain as they had planned to do this month
The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional smaller car
By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines
The board 's action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws
A shock wave from Africa
Word of Dag Hammarskjold 's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe
As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously
It was on the eve of a momentous U.N. session to come to grips with cold war issues
His firm hand will be desperately missed
Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace
He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe the secessionist president of Congo 's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody
He earnestly urged a cease-fire
The story of the fatal crash is not fully known
The U.N.-chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired
Whether this or overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined
The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations most controversial leader
He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice
He courageously defended the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc
The Congo in whose cause he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs
His policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape
When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr. Hammarskjold despite the danger flew to exert a calming influence
He gave his life for his beliefs
The U.N. session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing
It is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments
If the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice
That is the hope of mankind
Monument to togetherness
reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of Greater Miami 's hardest tasks
Too many have bogged down in bickering
Even when public bodies arrived at a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual
So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity
All nine members of the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody Company 's proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center
The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract
If the indenture is accepted the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue
Then Goodbody will hand over a minimum of 15.5 million for developing the spacious Graves Tract to house the center
The next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port Authority
They allotted 500,000 three years ago to support Interama until its own financing could be arranged
Less than half the sum has been spent since the Interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations
The balance is being budgeted for the coming year
Unanimity on Interama is not surprising
It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed
The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim of 8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project
County officials have cooperated consistently
So have the people 's elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels
Interama as it rises will be a living monument to Greater Miami 's ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises
A short report and a good one
progress or lack of it toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights
Much happened in this field during the past 12 months
Each state advisory committee documented its own activity
Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida 's is the shortest of all requiring only four paragraphs
`` The established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas `` reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South Floridians William D. Singer and John B. Turner of Miami
`` No complaints or charges have been filed during the past year either verbally or written from any individual or group
`` The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights ``
Problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint
The progress reported by the advisory committee is real
While some think we move too fast and others too slowly Florida 's record is a good one and stands out among the 50
West Germany remains Western
West Germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead on Berlin and unification with a coalition government
This is the key fact emerging from Sunday 's national election
Chancellor Adenauer 's Christian Democratic Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957
In order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength
Inevitably this means some compromise
The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired
Both Willy Brandt 's Social Democrats who gained 22 seats in the new parliament and the Free Democrats who picked up 23 will insist on that before they enter the government
Moon-faced Ludwig Erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him
If he becomes chancellor Dr. Erhart would make few changes
The wizard who fashioned West Germany 's astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise
He is dedicated to building the nation 's strength and as are all West Germans to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany
What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart with 45 per cent of the vote approaches the party of Willy Brandt which won 36 per cent the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve
West Berlin 's Mayor Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it
The Free Democrats 12 per cent of the vote believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the Soviet Union and more dealings with the Communist bloc
The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility
It could go either way since the gains for both points of view were about the same
Regardless of the decision two facts are clear
West Germany with its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations
And the career of Konrad Adenauer who upheld Germany 's tradition of rock-like leaders which Bismarck began draws near the end
Better ask before joining
Americans are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing
But it can be dangerous if the joiner does n't want to make a spectacle of himself
For instance so-called `` conservative `` organizations some of them secret are sprouting in the garden of joining where `` liberal `` organizations once took root
One specific example is a secret `` fraternity `` which will `` coordinate anti-Communist efforts ``
The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled
According to The Chicago Tribune News Service State Atty Gen. Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1
Does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations
Does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges
Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically
Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars Communism depression and other troubles of the world
Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns
Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate
In some instances a seventh question can be added 7
Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition or preference to the American system
If the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time
Falling somewhere in a category between Einstein 's theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there nevertheless -- is the tropical green `` city `` of Islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents limited access and an unlimited future
The latter is what concerns us all
Whatever land you can see here from the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land
And what you ca n't see the land underneath the water belongs to someone too
The public
The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment
In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours
In this instance happily insistence is being made that our share is protected
And until this protection is at least as concrete as say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach those who represent us all should agree to nothing
Closed doors in city hall
The reaction of certain City Council members to California 's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing
We had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public
In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes collectively known as the Brown Act the Legislature declares that `` the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people 's business
It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly
`` The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them
The people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know
The full implementation of these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature
Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act
Despite the lip service paid by local governments the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations
When all else fails it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations
We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims
Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily
But the citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious
Help when needed
If the Dominican Republic achieves free democratic government it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship
Outwardly Ciudad Trujillo is calm
None of the Trujillo family remains
Mr. Balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring
Had U.S. warships not appeared off the Dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war
Ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba
Within the Organization of American States there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously
But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo 's waterfront shouting `` Vive Yankees ``
More the U.S. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader Dr. Juan Bosch as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future ``
Mr. Balaguer 's troubles are by no means over
He will need the help of all OAS members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike
In cooperating toward that objective OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States
Matter of survival
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935
Now as then it is a matter of jobs
Craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance
The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members
That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations
Or that 's what it looked like at the time
But automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs
Walter Reuther leader of the industrial union faction of the AFL-CIO says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor
Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as say Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters is a matter of conjecture
But the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor
Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival this country can have little patience with labor 's family feuds
The concept of labor as a special class is outmoded and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive
the Army Navy and Air Force among others may question Secretary Freeman 's claim that the high estate of United States agriculture is the `` strongest deterrent `` to the spread of communism
But the secretary insists that the success of the American farmer is the `` greatest single source of strength `` in the struggle to insure freedom around the world
Mr. Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America 's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the Soviet 's successes in space
This should n't surprise the secretary
American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long long time
In fact over the years the American farmer 's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar
And thus far Mr. Freeman has offered very little relief
The 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored has been declared a billion dollar fiasco
In exchange for higher price supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage
But the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer
The result 1.1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget
Perhaps as Mr. Freeman says American agriculture may stop the Communists but it is also swindling the American taxpayer
What 's wrong at state
A senate subcommittee headed by Sen. Jackson of Washington has been going over the State Department and has reached some predictable conclusions
The department needs a clearer `` sense of direction `` at the top and it needs fewer but better people Sen. Jackson says
The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department
President Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance
But those who would revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes
Nor does Sen. Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy
This tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates
But competent observers believe he is making progress particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them ``
The Jackson report will provide some of the political support Mr. Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged as Sen. Jackson puts it `` in work that does not really need doing ``
Mr. Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen. Jackson 's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved
Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist
But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends
James P. Mitchell when he was the head of the department promised to eat his hat if unemployment did n't drop below three million a couple of years ago
He lost but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora
His successor Secretary Goldberg also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months
No betting man Mr. Goldberg says he 's merely `` putting my neck out again `` by predicting the rate will go down this month
He is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income an increase in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods
Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated
Mr. Goldberg has less reason for missing
The economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they ca n't be blamed in November
The odds thus appear favorable that the secretary 's neck may be spared
Cambodia 's chief of state who has been accused of harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia
But so convinced of communism 's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel
`` I have to see the facts `` is the way the prince puts it
And from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western posture
Prince Sihanouk 's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions
Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington 's economic forecasters
Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement
Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr. Hodges appraisal though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White House
And now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point
He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump
The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales
February 's volume was 1 per cent above January 's for the first pickup since last October although it 's still 1.5 per cent off from February 1960
Corroborating Mr. Hodges figures was the Federal Reserve Board 's report of the large sales increase in the nation 's department stores for the week ending March 4
In Newark for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level
Of course some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960
Another optimistic sign this one from the Labor Department was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments `` was interrupted for the first time in the week ending Feb. 25 ``
Initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week ending March 4
Mr. Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he does n't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes
Well we ca n't have everything
Prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut
In New Jersey too
New Jersey folk need not be told of the builder 's march to the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain
Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends far beyond our state
Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline the tiny tract at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant
But Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves
The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod from Provincetown to Chatham is strengthened by President Kennedy 's interest in that area
But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country
By comparison Stone Harbor bird sanctuary 's allies seem less formidable for aside from the Audubon Society they are mostly the snowy common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana green little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there
But there is hope for Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space
The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year
Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing
But that heritage is shrinking even faster
much of the glamor President Kennedy 's Peace Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent Shriver the head corpsman
Anybody who is expecting a joyride should according to Mr. Shriver get off the train right now
First of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling
It will be a 16-hour training day
Then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living conditions will be different
And the pay of course will be nil
Despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else
The study of the St. Louis area 's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois countryside
St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region
Slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region 's relative lack of purchasing power
Not all St. Louis industries of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood
But for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core
The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois
Gov Dalton 's New Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry
That is one approach
Another would be to take the advice of Dr. Elmer Ellis president of the University of Missouri and provide for an impartial professional analysis of Missouri 's economy
He says the state in order to proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy
The research center of the University 's School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake the analysis Dr. Ellis has been talking about
He and Dean John W. Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at a recent conference
The University can make a valuable contribution to the state 's economic development through such a study
In Southern Illinois the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth
The Carbondale Industrial Development Corp. has obtained a 500,000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs
Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West Frankfort labor market where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average
The Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri 's depressed areas and in the long run that will benefit St. Louis as well
Politics-ridden St. Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development
More industrial acreage lies vacant in St. Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St. Louis area
The unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side
And then there is St. Louis county where the Democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth
St. Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests
Some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St. Louis county does n't want industry and so they avoid the area and more jobs are lost
Metropolitan St. Louis 's relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi
Without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area 's economy there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and St. Louis will slip into second-class status
An excess of zeal
Many of our very best friends are reformers
Still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far
Take for example the reformers among New York City 's Democrats
Having whipped Mr. De Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall they have changed the name to Chatham Hall
Even though headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham building do they believe that they can make the new name stick
Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their credit
But it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name
After all it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-American the days in which the Sons of St. Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the British government that is
Further do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo
They will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant
Instead of attempting the impossible why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger 's stripes are not black
That might go over
The Faget case
The White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official Col. Mariano Faget from his preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service
The Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds
The Kennedy Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista
Using a Batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro
Moreover Col. Faget 's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in `` screening `` Castro agents
the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power
And while he had headed Batista 's anti-Communist section the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists
Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen. J. M. Swing an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service
Gen Swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office
His official term expired last summer
Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it could get
Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters but he has announced plans to retire in 1962
At that point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen Swing
The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat
Mr. Eisenhower politician
As President Dwight D. Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics
As a former President however Mr. Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New York Republican rally and generally missed his target
Mr. Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a `` juvenile experiment `` and to suggest sending a Corps member to the moon
This was juvenile ridicule
Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad
His words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding
The former President blithely ignored recent history in speaking of `` dollarette `` dollars under Kennedy Administration fiscal policies
It was the Eisenhower Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit
Finally Mr. Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington
This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis when President Eisenhower first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too
The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded
Ex-Presidents relieved of accountability for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words
Some of former President Truman 's off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein
Nobody can deny the right of former Chief Executives to take part in politics but the American people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility
This is a matter of respect for the Presidency
Mr. Eisenhower 's New York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship
Queen of the seas
The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed luxury and impeccable British service on the high seas
Reports that the venerable liner which has been in service since 1936 was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us
But the Cunard line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least
A new queen with the prosaic title of Q3 had been planned for several years to replace the Queen Mary
The British government concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling 50,400,000 toward the 84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger liner
Since 1957 more and more trans-Atlantic passengers have been crossing by air
Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines
Competition from other steamship lines has cut Cunard 's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run
The Cunard line has under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75,000 tons
This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months
Also under consideration is an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York
The decline of the Cunard line from its position of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation
Mission to Viet Nam
Gen. Maxwell Taylor 's statement in Saigon that he is `` very much encouraged `` about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster the Vietnamese Army
Gen. Taylor will report to President Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet Nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military economic political and other resources
There was good reason for Gen. Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time
Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a new crisis
South Viet Nam 's rice surplus for next year -- more than 300,000 tons -- may have been destroyed
The Viet Cong the Communist rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories
The rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November
Nothing that is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of United States soldiers for other than instructional missions
The Indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 when Gen. Ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the French were losing
It is a war to stay out of today especially in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently does not want United States troops
He may want additional technical help and this should be forthcoming
South Viet Nam has received 1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson 's visit last May
Gen. Taylor the President 's special military adviser is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure
It is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable and that they will not lead to involving the United States in an Asian morass
Gov John M. Dalton himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General Assembly or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained not because of their legal talents but because of their government influence
The U.N. 's gravest crisis
Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.N. 's problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced ``
Of course it is
If the decision goes wrong it may be -- as Mr. Stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill `` to a U.N. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning
The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be as the Charter puts it `` the chief administrative officer of the Organization `` but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the Organization ``
In other words the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one
He should be as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the world
The Charter does stipulate that `` due regard `` shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible ``
The United States and its allies have had no objection to this
What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold 's death to turn the entire U.N. staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come
The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and more particularly around the nature of his relationship with them
Although the United States and the U.S.S.R. have been arguing whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work
If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary General 's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed
If they give him advice when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction the nature of the U. N. will not of necessity change
The Secretary General must have subject to the constitutional direction of the Security Council and the General Assembly the power to act to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else 's instructions
This is the root issue for which the United States should stand
We should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography
What we must have if the United Nations is to survive is as nonpolitical nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject to no single nation 's direction and subservient to no single nation 's ambition
What the new charter does
The new City Charter which should get a Yes vote as Question No 1 on Nov. 7 would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one
There is no such magic in man-made laws
But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor 's executive powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy
Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor
Thus there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative
The board is diminished in both respects while it retains control over zoning franchises pier leases sale leasing and assignment of property and other trusteeship functions
The board will be able to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the Mayor 's veto
but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering power
Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council and a two-thirds vote
The Controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog `` functions
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed
He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties which go to the Finance Department
On net balance in spite of Controller Gerosa 's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now
Borough Presidents while retaining membership in the Board of Estimate lose their housekeeping functions
Highways go to a new Department of Highways sewers to the Department of Public Works such street cleaning as Borough Presidents now do in Queens and Richmond to the Sanitation Department
Some fiscal changes are important
The expense operating budget is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy with the Mayor approving in fund transfers within a department
The capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises
but as a second-look safeguard each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds
A road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected
This will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business
it will also correct some injustices
Enlargement of the City Council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow
The Inter-american Press Association which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape Horn is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in eleven years
The I A. P. A. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere
and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution
As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime more and more Cuban publishers editors and correspondents were forced into exile
The I A. P. A. found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista 's dictatorship began in 1952
Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances
In such conditions all freedoms are lost
This in more diplomatic language is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States Government
He felt able to end on a note of hope
He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms
No group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American Press Association
Meeting in Moscow
The Twenty-second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced
According to the original program Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the `` bold program for building communism in our time `` which the Congress will adopt
But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have achieved Utopia by 1980 the world is watching Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future
The evident contradiction between the rosy picture of Russia 's progress painted by the Communist party 's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier Khrushchev 's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered
Whether it is or not the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated
And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive
This Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years
The widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress and the Central Committee it will elect will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job
Dr. Conant 's call to action
Dr. James B. Conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer
His earlier reports considered the American public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change
Now a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including New York has shattered this optimism
Dr. Conant has come away shocked and angry
His new book entitled `` Slums And Suburbs `` calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster
There is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr. Conant 's specific views
His strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open or permissive enrollment
Dr. Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality
His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend
But these are side issues to a powerful central theme
That theme cuts through hypocrisies complacency and double-talk
It labels the slums especially the Negro slums as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters
The villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters and Dr. Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike
The facts he adds are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of the color of their students
A call for action `` before it is too late `` has alarming implications when it comes from a man who in his previous reports on the schools cautioned so strongly against extreme measures
These warnings must not be treated lightly
Dr. Conant 's conscientious selfless efforts deserve the nation 's gratitude
He has served in positions of greater glamour both at home and abroad
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools
And now -- more junk mail
A fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail
He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps names addresses or even zone numbers
In accordance with legislation passed at the last session of Congress each Representative is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district
This means an added burden to innumerable postmen who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay and it presumably means an increased postal deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis
Our creditors do not forget us
Letter writing is a dying art
Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly typewritten
Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter
Old tired trembling the woman came to the cannery
She had she said heard that the plant was closing
It could n't close she said
She had raised a calf grown it beef-fat
She had with her own work-weary hands put seeds in the ground watched them sprout bud blossom and get ready to bear
She was ready to kill the beef dress it out and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup broth hash and stew against the winter
She had done it last year and the year before and the year before that and she and her people were dependent upon these cans for food
This did not happen in counties of North Georgia where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land
Nor in South Georgia where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields
This happened in Decatur DeKalb County not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta
And now the woman tired and trembling came here to the DeKalb County cannery
`` Is it so the cannery is going to close ``
O. N. Moss 61 tall grey as a possum canning plant chief since 1946 did n't know what to say
He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer
He did say he was out of cans the No 3 's but `` I requisitioned 22,000 ``
He said he had No 2 's enough to last two weeks more
Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one
A three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O. Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed
Reason the cannery loses 3,000 yearly
But DeKalb citizens those who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed to make any money
`` The cannery `` said Mrs. Lewellyn Lundeen an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 to handle the `` victory garden `` produce `` is a service to the taxpayer
And one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant grow vegetables and put them up
It helps those people who help themselves
`` The county though seems more interested in those people who do n't even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food ``
A driver of a dairy truck who begins work at 1 a.m. finishes before breakfast then goes out and grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five asked `` What in the world will we do ``
`` What in the world `` echoed others those come with the beans potatoes the tomatoes `` will any of us do ``
Moss a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county does n't believe it will close
But he is in the middle an employe of DeKalb but on the side of the people
The young married people
the old couples
The dairy truck driver
the old woman with the stew
`` Do n't ask me if I think the cannery helps `` he said
`` Sir I know the cannery helps ``
Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard
When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say `` Just forget it ``
There is one thing I know
a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge
I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades
Several years ago I was his pastor
One night at the close of the evening service he came forward left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to God
After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land
`` We tried to settle this dispute `` he said `` but could never come to an agreement
I settled it tonight `` he continued
`` I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor ``
Forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God
You can not wear the banner of God and at the same time harbor envy jealousy and grudges in your heart
Henry Van Dyke said `` Forgive and forget if you can
but forgive anyway ``
Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness
We must first of all be willing to forgive others before we can secure God 's forgiveness
`` For if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive -- your trespasses ``
Matthew 6 14-15
It will do no good to seek God 's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong
Then Jesus indicated that God 's forgiveness is unlimited
In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words `` Forgive us our debts ``
When a person meets God 's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven
God 's mercy and patience will last forever
Forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by God 's love
It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past
We want the past forgiven but at the same time we must be willing for God to direct the future
Finally we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us
Once Peter asked `` How oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him
Till seven times
Jesus saith unto him until seventy times seven ``
Matthew 18 21-22
Jesus not only taught forgiveness He gave us an example of it on the cross
With all the energy of his broken body he prayed `` Father forgive them for they know not what they do ``
Luke 23:34
She 's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although she 's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby she is getting married
Her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish said
For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I could n't have made myself heard if I 'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia
But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed drinking Cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute
`` How do you know you love somebody enough to get married ``
She asked
It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked How can you be sure
`` Are n't you sure ``
I asked looking at her searchingly
I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important
But if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage
Besides in all honesty I do n't know how you can be sure
I do n't know any secret recipe for certainty
In the fevered intoxicating breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured
I knew of but one test and I threw it out to her for what it was worth
`` Does he ever bore you ``
I asked
`` Bore me ``
She was shocked
Oh no-o
Why he 's so darling and ``
`` I mean `` I went on ruthlessly `` when he 's not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love is he interesting
Does he care about things that matter to you
Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating
Because honey I thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you 're hopelessly stranded together
And if you bore each other then heaven help you
She came back the other day to reassure me
She has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting
She asked if I had other advice and heady with success I rushed it in I hope not too late
Be friends with your mother-in-law
Jokes cartoons and cynics to the contrary mothers-in-law make good friends
I do not know Dr. Wilson Sneed well
But I was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St. Luke 's Church in Atlanta
It was the cry of not just one heart
it spoke for many in the clergy I suspect
The pulpit is a lonely place
Who stops to think of that
Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church
`` Such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments `` he told his members
A minister should not stay `` beyond the time that his leadership should benefit `` his church he wrote `` for he becomes ordinary
And so the young minister resigned to go and study and pray having never passed a day he told his parishioners when `` I did not gain from you far more than I ever gave to you ``
His very honest act called up the recent talk I had with another minister a modest Methodist who said `` I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love and comfort to other men and I would have it no other way and it is unworthy to think of self
But oh how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest and peace in myself ``
A man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving
He does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach
The good ones are not motivated to seek vainly nor are they disposed to covet comfort or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity
Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards
Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul
We press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word and God 's
We do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week American cash
If we break the minister to our bit we are buying back our own sins
If he wo n't break we add to the stress he bears
And a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to
We expect him to be noble and to make us so -- yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be
We expect bestowal of God 's love through him
But how little love we give him
The church truly is not a rest home for saints but a hospital for sinners
Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers too
Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake
The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure
The evening was not always spent in the same way
This year on a night cool with the front of September moving in but with plenty of summer still about the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod
The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages
In the midst of it all Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch alone
He had that day attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize
The prize was an old-fashioned woven cloth hammock complete with cross-top pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging
Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it and there it was slung in a vine-shaded corner the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement
Mr. Podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it
He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him
Suddenly one young voice rose above the others
`` But `` it said `` do you always know when you 're happy ``
The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound but the question stayed in Mr. Podger 's mind
Here in the cool autumn-touched evening Mr. Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace
It had begun with the blue jay feather
Walking along the lake before breakfast Mr. Podger had seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight
The winging spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood
The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet
All day long Mr. Podger who was a straw-hat man in the summer had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield
Would a blue feather in a man 's hat make him happy all day
But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake
Then since the auction was being held nearby he had walked to it
And there on the way had been the box turtle that slow self-contained world-ignoring relic of pre-history bent for reasons best known to itself on crossing the road
It was doing very well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car
Would the driver see the turtle
Would he take pains to avoid it
Mr. Podger took no chances
Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it Mr. Podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness
The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon
But Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other
Here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the friendly grin on the young sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight
Where was the driver now
What was he doing
And the turtle
Mr. Podger smiled
For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama
The three would never meet again but for some reason or other Mr. Podger was sure he would always remember the incident
Then there had been the auction itself
Mr. Podger heard again
at will the voice of the auctioneer the voices of the bidders and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr. Podger 's hammock purchase
`` I like them things too `` he had said
`` We got one at home
You know what
If you 're lyin out in the hammock at night and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap 'em right over you
I do it lots o times -- I like to lie in a hammock at night by myself when it 's all quiet
The wind moves it a little bit -- you know
Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely and now he made use of the advice
As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon Mr. Podger saw that thin attractive freckled little face again and hoped that the boy too was lying in a cool fringed-wrapped quiet
Alacrity the Podger cat came by the hammock rubbed her back briefly against it and then sure of a welcome hopped up
She remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly and Mr. Podger took her inside the fringe
Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod
Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out
`` Dad ``
She said
`` It 's getting so chilly we 've lighted a fire and we 're going to tell a round robin story -- a nice scary one
We need you to start it
Why are you out here all by yourself
Are n't you happy ``
Mr. Podger opened his cocoon and emerged tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire
`` Of course I am `` he said
`` Never happier in my life
I just came out here to know it ``
As the South begins another school year national and even world attention is directed at the region 's slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools
Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities -- Dallas and Atlanta
In each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment
These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully
The programs do not take sides on the issue itself
They point out simply that `` it is the law of the land ``
The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation
Even better they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs
In each case there was an initial act of violence
In Nashville a school was dynamited
In Houston there were a few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes none of which were serious
In each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents
The Nashville plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South
It is a `` stair-step `` plan in which desegregation begins in the first grade
Each year another grade is added to the process until finally all 12 grades are integrated
The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done `` so why not now ``
The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston
It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents
Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program
Generally throughout the South there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met
Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas
During the summer Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments
It was part of a citywide move toward full integration
So successful has been this program worked out by white and Negro civic leaders that further extensions are expected in the next few months
Hotels for example are ready to let down the bars
Already at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis
Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis
This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas
It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South
Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights
They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots
All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it
There are many causes for this change
One of the most important is economic
Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence
They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order
In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way
And as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of co-operation has sprung up
This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation
They realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise
Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago I 've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship
Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles it goes like this
A driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h in Lane A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead
Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane B which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m.p.h
The adjacent driver in Lane B has three choices open to him
He can 1 point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane A
2 slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes
or 3 alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair
The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access
Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation I do n't know
But it is done consistently and I 'm both surprised and impressed
This could never happen in my native Chicago
There such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood
In Chicago the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back
Failing this he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly
This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways however does an injustice to Southern California drivers
At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype
After three months of research I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I 've ever encountered
During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street
Miami Fla. March 17
An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year
Now Richards of course is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go
He can often make the complex ridiculously simple and vice versa
This happened to be vice versa but even so the answer was a masterpiece
`` It 's a whole lot easier `` he said `` to increase the population of Nevada than it is to increase the population of New York city ``
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher
`` That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote `` said the writer scratching his head
`` Now if I can just figure out what he 's talking about I 'll use it ``
Two spots open
This was just Richard 's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open
Some brilliant rookies nailed them down so that this spring just two spots left and right field are really up for grabs
It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year but so far it has n't worked that way
This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one
You 'd never guess it from the way they 've played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961
Obviously if this club is going to move from second to first in the American League it will have to show improvement someplace
Where can that improvement possibly come from
You certainly ca n't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year
Robby could be better
Brooks Robinson is great and it is conceivable that he 'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960
You ca n't expect it though
Robby 's performance last year was tremendous
It 's the same with Ron Hansen and Jim Gentile
If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint
They should n't be asked to carry any more of the burden
Hansen will be getting a late spring training start which might very well set him back
He got off to an exceptional start last season and under the circumstances probably wo n't duplicate it
There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year
They do n't expect to stop him just slow him down some with the bat
He 'll still be a top player they concede because he 's got a great glove and the long ball going for him
But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production
Breeding might move up
Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs
Do n't ask him more
I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch
But even so he had a good year in 1960 and wo n't do too much better
So all in all the infield ca n't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first
And the pitching will also have trouble doing better
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season
Where then can we look for improvement
`` From Triandos Brandt and Walker `` answers Richards
`` They 're the ones we can expect to do better ``
The man is right and at this time indications are that these three are ready for better seasons
Triandos has n't proved it yet but he says he 's convinced his thumb is all right
He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury has n't bothered him
If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years the club will have to be better off offensively
I 'm still not convinced though I 'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him
Hank Foiles backed up by Frank House who will be within calling distance in the minors make up better second line catching than the Birds had all last year but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant
To me Brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year
He has n't played too much because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice
He 's hitting the ball hard in the batting cage and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year
When he came to Baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National League pennant and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American League club
He was down hard to talk to and far too nonchalant on the field
As of now that all seems behind him
He 's been entirely different all spring
And Walker looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year
Let him bounce back and he could really set up the staff
So if the Orioles are to improve Brandt Triandos and Walker will have to do it
So far the platoons on left and right fielders do n't seem capable of carrying the load
Of course this is n't taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York city but it 's the way things look from here at this point
Is the mother of an `` autistic `` child at fault
The `` autistic `` child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self
He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people
Did his mother make him this way
Some people believe she did
We think differently
We believe that autism like so many other conditions of defect and deviation is to a large extent inborn
A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties
Sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them
But we do n't think she creates them
We do n't think she can make her child defective emotionally disturbed or autistic
The mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem
Since little is known about autism and almost nothing has been written for the layman we 'd like to share one experienced mother 's comments
She wrote
As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything I have to manipulate my son 's fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy
He wants me to do everything for him
`` You do n't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them
But I do and my psychiatrist does too
I know that my son wants control and direction but being autistic myself I can not give full control or direction
`` One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned
This is that autistic people do n't enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance my children and I
When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board
He pushes and straightens himself as if he ca n't stand the feeling of being held
Physical contact is uncomfortable for him ``
This mother is quite correct
As a rule the autistic child does n't enjoy physical contact with others
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him
For the young child this may be no more than providing food light or movement
As he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object his `` magic `` thing
Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick
The answer is different for each autistic child but for most there is an answer
Only ingenuity will uncover it
What future holds
`` Dear Doctors We learned this year that our older son Daniel is autistic
We did not accept the diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to
Fortunately there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group of normal children
`` I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal though of course I realize he is far from that at present
What I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible
I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible
`` What is your experience with autistic children
How do they turn out later ``
Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives
Certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people but many adjust to school even college to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood
-- A first grader colors pictures one solid color everything -- sky grass boy wagon etc
When different colors are used she is just as likely to color trees purple hair green etc
The other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color
Should I show my daughter how things should be colored
She is an aggressive nervous child
Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits
-- Her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects
This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade
No coloring is n't exactly something you teach a child
You sometimes give them a little demonstration a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines
But most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration
Seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art embroidery
Possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed
Just as a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme so may some of the newest versions of embroidery
One such in fact is a rug
Though not actually crewel embroidery it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue pink bronze and gold and a sauterne background
The twirled stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in England
Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country
The work is executed in England by hand and can be worked in any desired design and color
Among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color
For a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this revered Eighteenth Century period
Since the work is done by hand the only limitation it is said `` is that of human conception ``
Modern embroidered panels framed and meant to be hung on the wall are another aspect of this trend
These have never gone out of style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts
An amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings and by picking up her living room color scheme add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room
California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters party clubrooms and workers backyards
They seem darned proud of it
And they 're confident that the GOP currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine
Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate
But it will include 200-odd officeholders organization leaders and `` interested party people ``
Out of this session may come 1
-- Plans for a dramatic broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer Democrats from all over the country
-- Blueprints for doubling the CDC 's present 55,000 enrollment
-- Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in Fresno next Jan. 26-28
-- And proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state 's 38 new Congressional districts
At the head of the CDC is an unorthodox 39-year-old amateur politico Thomas B. Carvey Jr. whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft 's moon missiles
He 's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion
Viewed from afar the CDC looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so
Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer `` Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the Aj
Moreover the entire state Democratic hierarchy from Gov Brown on down to the county chairmen also participates in this huge operation
Contrarily Republican `` volunteers `` go their separate ways and thus far have given no indication that they 'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate except in the most loose-knit fashion
Carvey believes that reapportionment which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries actually will increase CDC membership
Where only one club existed before he says two will flourish henceforth
Biggest organizational problem he adds is setting up CDC units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory
Paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party 's favor strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly even basis
Like most Democratic spokesmen Carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously `` partisan year ``
Hence the attention they 're lavishing on the Aj
In all probability the council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites
This bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who do n't see eye-to-eye with the Aj
Naturally the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council
Shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John F. Kennedy last year who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential campaign the CDC plainly intends to provide the party 's campaign muscle in 1962
There is evidence that it will be happily received by Gov Brown and the other constitutional incumbents
Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown 's most formidable foe with ex-Gov Knight a close second
But the rest of the GOP gubernatorial aspirants do n't worry him very much
In his CDC work Carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of California 's shrewdest political strategists former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty Gen. Stanley Mosk
Significantly bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren are still audible in party circles
note We 've just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention Wednesday night in South Pasadena 's War Memorial Bldg which graphically illustrates the CDC 's broad appeal
State Sen. Dick Richards will keynote
state and county committeemen CDC directors and representatives members of 16 area clubs and `` all residents `` have been invited

It is a short course in Communese
It works with English Russian German Hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue
Once you learn how to translate Communese much of each day 's deluge of news will become clearer
At least I have found it so
For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated Dr. Freud Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves
They accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty
President Kennedy 's latest warning to the Communist world that the United States will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain
Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency
Now listen closely
Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England
`` President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism
Evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the West have been planned long in advance
The West Berlin crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the United States to justify its arms drive ``
The Soviet news agency TASS datelined from New York in English to Europe
`` President Kennedy 's enlargement of the American military program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American munitions industry
When the stock exchange opened this morning many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas Lockheed and United Aircraft and prices rose substantially
Over 4 million shares were sold the highest figures since early June
Quotations follow ``
TASS datelined Los Angeles in English to Europe
`` Former Vice President Nixon came out in support of President Kennedy 's program for stepping up the arms race
He also demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension specifically to crush the Cuban revolution resume nuclear testing resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful seat in the United Nations and postpone non-military programs at home ``
TASS from Moscow in English to Europe
`` The American press clamored for many days promising President Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the United States
In fact the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current President
If there were no West Berlin problem imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the United States and its NATO partners
Washington apparently decided to use an old formula by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U.S. economy after a prolonged slump ``
And now for Communist listeners and readers
Moscow Radio in Russian to the USSR
`` The U.S. President has shown once again that the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis to justify the armaments race
As was to be expected Kennedy 's latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn where officials of the West German government praised it ``
Moscow Novosti article in Russian datelined London
`` U.S. pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status of West Berlin has reached its apogee
British common sense is proverbial
The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to pull somebody else 's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures ``
East Berlin Communist radio in German to Germany
`` A better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech
Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West Berlin neither conventional nor nuclear and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty
Whenever some Washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn
In Kennedy 's speech are cross currents sensible ones and senseless ones reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President 's advisers and the political and economic forces behind them
Well dear listeners despite all the shouting there will be no war over West Berlin ``
Moscow TASS in Russian datelined Sochi
`` Chairman Khrushchev received the U.S. President 's disarmament adviser John McCloy
Their conversation and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere ``
Now to translate from the Communese this means
The `` West Berlin `` crisis is really an East Berlin crisis
The crisis was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin Wall Street and the Red Army Pentagon egged on by the West Germans East Germans
The reason was to speed up domestic production in the USSR which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power and try to end the permanent recession in Russian living standards
Chairman Khrushchev Kennedy rattles his rockets sabre in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position
His advisers in the Politburo White House are engaged in a great struggle of opinions so he is not always consistent
The Soviet Union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies
The West has no intention of attacking Russia
Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy had a terrible row at Sochi
See Communese is easy -- once you get onto it
Aug. 4 1821 nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded the Pennsylvania Gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening Post
The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C. Atkinson and Charles Alexander who had just taken over Franklin 's old paper desired a more distinctive name
When founded by Franklin the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction poetry and literary essays
In the middle of the century with a circulation of 90,000 the Post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country
But during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus H. K. Curtis purchased it -- `` paper type and all `` -- for 1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany and with only some 2,000 subscribers
Little more than a fine old name valuable principally because of the Franklin tradition the Saturday Evening Post was slow to revive
But Curtis poured over 1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country

Among the many stories about the late Speaker Rayburn is one from Rep. Dwyer R-6th Dist
Mrs. Dwyer 's husband M. Joseph Dwyer was taking a 10-year-old boy from Union County on the tour of the Capitol during the final weeks of the last session
They ran across Mr. Rayburn and the youngster expressed a desire to get the Speaker 's autograph

The 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament the first part of the New English Bible undertaken as a new translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English
Since it was issued in the spring of 1611 the King James Version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the Bible
However Biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced
This resulted in revisions of the King James Bible in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in 1901 as the American Standard Version
Then in 1937 America 's International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages
Undertaken by 32 American scholars under the chairmanship of Rev Dr. Luther A. Weigle former dean of Yale University Divinity School their studies resulted in the publishing of the Revised Standard Version 1946-52
The New English Bible the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a future date has not been planned to rival or replace the King James Version but as its cover states it is offered `` simply as the Bible to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship ``
Time of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose
Bible reading even more so than good classical music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition
If this new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years it will not survive the ages as has the King James Version
However an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars
One is impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary English and there is no doubt that the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the King James
For example in the third chapter of Matthew verses 13-16 describing the baptism of Jesus the 1611 version reads
`` Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him
`` But John forbad him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me
`` And Jesus answering said unto him Suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
Then he suffered him
`` And Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him ``
Certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with Biblical teachings in the New English Bible which reads `` Then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee and he came to John to be baptized by him
John tried to dissuade him
Do you come to me
He said
I need rather to be baptized by you
Jesus replied let it be so for the present
we do well to conform this way with all that God requires
John then allowed him to come
After baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once and at that moment heaven opened
he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him ``
the paragraphing spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version
Among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons other than scholars really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount
To illustrate the first blessing in the King James Bible reads `` Blessed are the poor in spirit
for their 's is the kingdom of heaven ``
The new version states `` How blest are those who know that they are poor
the kingdom of Heaven is theirs ``
Some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone with a fair knowledge of the English language can understand the meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar
To a novice that is significant
In the second and third chapters of Revelation the new version retains however the old phrase `` angel of the church `` which Biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop
This is not contemporary English
For the most part however the new version is contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of Christ
Originally recorded by hand these words have been copied and recopied translated and retranslated through the ages
Discoveries recently made of old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a restudy of the Bible
To have the results recorded in everyday usable English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth
There is one danger however
With contemporary English changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic
The only answer will be continuous study

Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet
That is why it is important to invest in comfortable airy types of shoes
There are many soft and light shoe leathers available
Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers
Softness is found in crushed textures
Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape
Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette
Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights
Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes
Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps
While white is the coolest summer shade there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color
In the tintable group are high and little heels squared and oval throats and shantung-like textures
Do n't overlook the straws this year
They come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural white black and a whole range of colors
In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles
For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning
The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot
Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac
In a brighter nautical vein is Ille De France blue
Contrast trim provides other touches of color
Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black navy and taffy tan
Designed for ease
Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated

An electric toothbrush Broxodent may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the American bathroom
The brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface including the back of the teeth
In addition the motor has the seal of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories which means it is safe
The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in
The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor
The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own
Most of us brush our teeth by hand
The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men
The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction the way dentists recommend
In addition it is small enough to get into crevices jacket and crown margins malposed anteriors and the back teeth
The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel
It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly
Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device
The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly
The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly bedfast with a chronic disease or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy
But for many of us it will prove an enjoyable luxury
It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles
Since the apparatus is new it requires experimentation and changes in technique
writes Does numbness in the left hand at night which awakens the person indicate brain tumor
This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand
The pressure may come from muscles tendons or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand
writes Do steam baths have any health value
No other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder
An ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same
Sewing brings numbness
writes What makes my hands numb when sewing
There are many possibilities including poor circulation a variety of neurological conditions and functional disorders
This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer 's cramp
Brace for sciatica
writes Does a brace help in sciatica
A back brace might help depending upon the cause of sciatica
Cholesterol and thyroid
writes Does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed
It usually goes up
The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body
It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish
The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed
The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue
There 's more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison 's first experiment in recorded sound
Edison could hardly have guessed however that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo
If the record buyer 's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric he will find them satisfied on educational records
And he will avoid eye-strain in the process
Everything from poetry to phonetics history to histrionics philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable
For sheer ambition take the Decca series titled modestly `` Wisdom ``
Volumes One and Two selected from the sound tracks of a television series contain `` conversations with the elder wise men of our day ``
These sages include poet Carl Sandburg statesman Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz in Volume One and playwright Sean O'Casey David Ben-Gurion philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank Lloyd Wright in the second set
Hugh Downs is heard interviewing Wright for an added prestige fillip
There 's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications
Dover `` publishes `` what the company calls `` Listen And Learn `` Productions designed to teach foreign languages
Previous presentations have been on French Spanish Russian Italian German and Japanese

In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future Herbert A. Leggett banker-editor of the Phoenix `` Arizona Progress `` reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties
One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows which gave him inferiority complexes
Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent well-informed American
But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a 2,000,000 profit on the stock market
Every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb
Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough
People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements
The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it
His answer was simple but honest
He just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye
One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication
The child understands no
He senses his mother 's disapproval
But explanations leave him confused and unmoved
If his mother loves him he clings to that love as a ballast
It motivates his behavior
He wants Mommy to think him a good boy
He does n't want her to look frowningly at him or speak to him angrily
This breaks his heart
He wants to be called sweet good considerate and mother 's little helper
But even mother 's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior
His desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother 's love for him and what she expects of him in order to overcome them
His own inner voice which should tell him what not to do has not developed
It wo n't develop until he has words with which to clothe it
The conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old
What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior
She can decrease the number of temptations
She can remove all knick-knacks within reach
The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be
She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child
If he ca n't play with Mommy 's magazines he should have some old numbers of his own
If Daddy 's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not
Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove
During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child 's conscience
She tells him of the consequences of his behavior
If he bites a playmate she says `` Danny wo n't like you ``
If he snatches a toy she says `` Caroline wants her own truck just as you do ``
There is no use trying to `` Explain `` to a 2-year-old
Actions speak louder
Remove temptations
Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior
Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act
He wo n't submit to his natural desires all the time and it 's Mother 's love that is responsible for his good behavior
This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` Homecoming Day ``
They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes
The football opponent on homecoming is of course selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian when thrown to one of the emperor 's lions
It is true of course the uncertainties of life being what they are that as now and then the Christian killed the lion homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team
Even with all possible precaution homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them
More often than not as the Old Grad wanders along the old paths his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain
He can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall
It is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates faces alight holding hands and talking happily as they come along oblivious of him or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances such as they would give a tethered goat
Usually they titter loudly after they have passed by
His dream goes
He feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him
His bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous
His bifocals blur
His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary as if he had walked for miles instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths
Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth
It is not much better if he meets with old classmates
Too often unless he hails them they pass him by
He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said on returning from a homecoming reunion that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they did n't even recognize him
If they do meet and recognize one another slap backs and embrace the moment soon is done
After all when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie when one has inquired who it was Sue Brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it
By then one begins to notice the middle-age spread
the gray hairs the eyeglasses bodies that are too thin or too heavy
the fading signs of old beauty
the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then it is time to break it up and move on
It is if anything worse on the old player
He sits in the stands and he does n't like that
Enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd
He always feels lonely
A team feels something
On a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him
In the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about him
He sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped
the churning of straining feet the rasp of the canvas pants
the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeves across his face
He remembers the desperate panting breath
the long runs on the kick-offs
the hard jolting tackles
the breakthrough
the desperate agony of goal-line stands
And so he squirms with each play remembering his youth
But it is no use
It is gone
No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength they can never be recaptured again
Since the obvious is not always true the Republican National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred as suspected in the larger cities
Of 40 cities with populations of 300,000 and more Mr. Kennedy carried 26 and Mr. Nixon 14
There are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election
These are New York Pennsylvania Michigan Maryland Missouri New Jersey Illinois and Minnesota
In 1952 Mr. Eisenhower won all but Missouri
Yet in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr. Kennedy
Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia
Mr. Nixon despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed to do so
His visit to Warsaw Poland after the Russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which in several cities is substantial
Yet the GOP breakdown discovered that in Philadelphia Mr. Nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` Polish `` vote
30 per cent of the `` Irish `` vote and 18 per cent of the `` Negro `` vote
task force
A GOP `` task force committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities
The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders
These gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of Mr. Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment
This error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one `` and not a reality
The almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical
They did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor Goldberg as politics which the GOP declared it to be
The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery
Senator Mundt 's gross distortion of President Eisenhower 's conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy as too left wing a statement Mr. Eisenhower declared to be entirely false is another case in point
If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the Social Security program they will thereby erect still another barrier to GOP hopes in the cities
The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt Goldwater Bridges Dirksen et al is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s
In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr. Hoover and the party 's failure to anticipate or cope with the depression caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash
The Republican party was not lacking in humanity but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble
Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` Hoover carts ``
Smokers reduced to `` the makings `` spoke of the sack tobacco as `` Hoover dust ``
One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership has n't meant to repeat this error
But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John F. Kennedy
That this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new President is conducting the nation 's business
The most articulate Republicans are those who in their desire to get back at Mr. Kennedy already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care
If they also defeat the school bill the GOP task force wo n't have much research to do
It will early know why the party wo n't win back city votes
The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider
The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner
After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative Forum this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature in history
Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances not his convictions
Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever
And just how far can the Legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor 's race ``
How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt. Gov Garland Byrd 's Senate Committee on Government Operations
The situation already was bad because the Legislature moved the governor 's race forward a few months causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual
But when former Gov Marvin Griffin and Lt. Gov Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November the situation was aggravated
Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation
To have refused would have been political suicide
And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity when the bravado comments are cast aside
The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates
It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the `` serious candidates ``
But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said no and he did n't mince any words
`` They are just asking too much `` he said
We ca n't think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates either
There are other dangers
Politics is an accelerating game
`` If an opponent accuses you of lying do n't deny it
Say he is a horse thief `` runs an old adage
These men are spenders
If either one ever started making promises there is no telling where the promises would end
Griffin 's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd 's 60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper 's oaths
The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one
Why not have them travel the state in November debating
It would present a forum for them in almost every community
But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor 's race being run in the next Legislature the spectre of big spending programs the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin
There is a way out of this
The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum
It has arranged a campaign for governor
If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates it can provide a service to the state
But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race
Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was not a `` great soldier ``
Ike 's somewhat like George Washington
Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from British strategy
Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire President Kennedy so much they 're even willing to heed his call to sacrifice -- and give up his program
Slogan of the John Birch Society `` Paddle your own canoe

A Republican survey says Kennedy won the '60 election on the religious issue
Too many people were afraid if the GOP won they 'd have to spend all their time praying
The Providence Journal editorial Jan. 25 entitled `` East Greenwich Faces A Housing Development Problem `` points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours
Your suggested solution it seems to me is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound planning
First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested
This land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town
The demand for these lots can be met for some time to come
This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither `` to halt an influx of migrants `` nor are we `` setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites ``
What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development
It is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs
Bostitch Inc. is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax
The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory
The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars
With our current 3 per hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant `` as the best way to meet these problems
In order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure
As this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow
Mr. Richard Preston executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8 1960 warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said `` If this is the fundamental reason for a community 's interest or if this is the basic approach success if any will be difficult to obtain ``
He went on to say `` In the first place industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities
It is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be ``
While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth
We in East Greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year
It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich School Committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase
If they are to be commended for foresight in their planning what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage
Where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials
I submit that it can not be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life
The `` fruitful course `` of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of East Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called
For example 1
The East Greenwich Police Department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police Department thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East Greenwich-Potowomut area of the two communities
The East Greenwich Fire District services parts of Warwick as well as East Greenwich
The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums of money as do other Kent County communities for the support of the Kent County Memorial Hospital a regional facility
The East Greenwich Free Library receives financial support from the town of East Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment
Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East Greenwich
East Greenwich was one of the first Rhode Island towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode Island Development Council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves
The education program for retarded children conducted by the East Greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community
I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as East Greenwich
I believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts
and yet they can not ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised
These programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what manner the community shall grow
We have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions
Until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts I hope we in East Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny
I would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the Gabrielle Fund
It is indeed true as stated in the famous novel of our day `` For Whom The Bell Tolls `` that `` no man is an island entirely of itself
every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main ``
Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Irving J. Fain president of the Temple Beth El
Rev DeWitt Clemens pastor of the Mathewson Street Methodist Church
Mr. Felix Miranda of the Imperial Knife Co.
and to Mrs. Rozella Switzer regional director of The National Conference of Christians and Jews who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund
It is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful and good
Bless you my friends for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality
I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School
My future plans are to become a language teacher
Of course having this desire I am very interested in education
A few weeks ago I read in the Bulletin that there were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston
The article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes
The following week I read in the Sunday paper that the students of Russia begin European and Asian languages in the seventh grade
I wish you could see the situation as I see it
If Russian pupils have to take these languages how come American students have a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many exceptions
I do not think that America is like Russia not in the least
I am proud of my country the small city I live in my wonderful parents my friends and my school
but I am also a young able and willing girl who wants to study the Chinese language but is not old enough
Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced than American students
Well there lies your answer
At the height of the first snowstorm we had it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency
However the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation
Words can not tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me
The concern they felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for which I will always be grateful
The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather
Had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did perhaps I would not be here to commend them at this time
Many thanks for a job well done
The Providence Sunday Journal article Jan. 29 asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though The Providence Journal is desperate for news
Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page
On the question of admission to Veterans Administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service
It can manifest itself before discharge from service or it can come out years later
There is one other point we should never lose sight of Many veterans who enter VA hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected
No psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years
The arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public
I believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to VA hospitals
But I do n't believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients
This matter is of great importance and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries for many veterans
Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long
There 's a reason for this length of stay
First of all the admitting physician in the VA hospital gets the patient as a new patient
He has no experience with this veteran 's previous medical record
If the doctor is conscientious he wants to study the patient
As a result it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient
Secondly the VA physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient
So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery
The American public must be presented with the facts concerning VA hospitalization
The public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a VA hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other
The responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a VA hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital
An adequate system of VA hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals
It seems that open season upon veterans hospitalization is once more upon us
The American Medical Association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the Veterans Administration medical program to the American taxpayer
Do they the A.M.A offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world
We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at VA hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness
Nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the A.M.A on the health problem confronting the aged
They opposed the Forand bill which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction
yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars matched incidentally by a federal grant to initiate
`` A lousy job ``
Chicago Aug. 9
-- No doubt there have been moments during every Presidency when the man in the White House has had feelings of frustration exasperation exhaustion and even panic
This we can sympathetically understand
But no President ever before referred to his as a `` lousy job `` as Walter Trohan recently quoted President Kennedy as doing in conversation with Sen. Barry Goldwater
During his aggressive campaign to win his present position Mr. Kennedy was vitriolic about this country 's `` prestige `` abroad
What does he think a remark like this `` lousy `` one does to our prestige and morale
If the President of the United States really feels he won himself a `` lousy job `` then heaven help us all
Evansville Ind Aug. 5
-- Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara has asked Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars
Why should Congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection
Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time
The scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter
This sum spent for foreign economic aid the peace corps food for peace or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace increased world trade and prosperity for every country on the globe
Let us prepare for peace instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization
Short shorts on the campus
Chicago Aug. 4
-- It seems college is n't what it should be
I refer to the attire worn by the students
Upon a visit to a local junior college last week I was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing Bermuda shorts
Is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years
Education should be uppermost in their minds but with this attire how can anyone think it is so
It looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves
High school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students
Many high school students go past my house every day and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen
No matter how hot the day they are dressed properly and not in shorts
Chicago Aug. 9
-- The granting of the Jan Masaryk award August 13 to Senator Paul Douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities
Douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed Masaryk and against principles Masaryk died to uphold
Douglas has voted for aid to Communists and for the destruction of individual freedom public housing foreign aid etc
Subsidies from CTA
Oak Park Aug. 8
-- In Today 's `` Voice `` the CTA is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens
Rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly and I would be the last to say they should not receive consideration
But why is it the special responsibility of the CTA to help these people
Why should CTA regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should
The welfare of citizens old and young is the responsibility of the community not only of that part of it that rides the Aj
CTA regulars already subsidize transportation for school children policemen and firemen
Chicago Aug. 9
-- In reply to a letter in Today 's `` Voice `` urging the sale of meat after 6 p.m. I wish to state the other side of the story
I am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market
My husband 's hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. the early part of the week and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends
Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings -- and Sundays too for this is coming
There is a trend to packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying stores where meat cutters will not be required
If a customer wishes a special cut it will not be available
We are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not
Most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week on week-ends when prices are lower
Also many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them
Independent market owners work six days a week
and my husband has n't had a vacation in 14 years
No we are not greedy
But if we closed the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block
The meat cutters union which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets
What it is trying to do is to protect the little man too as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores with choice of cut being made by the consumer not the store
The Legion Convention and Sidney Holzman
Chicago Aug. 9
-- I too congratulate the American Legion of which I am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years on the recent state convention
I regret that Bertha Madeira Today 's `` Voice `` obtained incorrect information
Had I been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege the matter she raised would have been clarified
The resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the American flag
Judges under the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this
The resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag
It was my desire to advise the membership of the Legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and without an amendment to the law we could not enforce this
My discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises and not by innuendo criticize them
At no time did I attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the Chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties
Teaching the handicapped
Chicago Aug. 7
-- The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the Catholic charities of the archdiocese of Chicago and DePaul University of the establishment of the Institute for Special Education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children
In these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field
The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children of studying the needs of handicapped children in Illinois and of promoting more adequate services for them indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of Illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children

-- I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed your June 25 article on Liberace and to thank you for it
Please do put more pictures and articles in about Liberace as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person
More school less pay
Chicago Aug. 7
-- Is this perhaps one of the things that is wrong with our country
Engineering graduates of Illinois Institute of Technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the school 's history -- 550 a month
My son who has completed two years in engineering school has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer
At a rate of 3.22 an hour he is now earning approximately 580 a month
Ironic is it not that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer
The Dupont case
Editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page
Washington Aug. 4
-- Your July 26 editorial regarding the position of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on prospective tax relief for DuPont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact
As a result your criticism of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Department of Justice was inaccurate unwarranted and unfair
The editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on DuPont stockholders in connection with the United States Supreme Court ruling that DuPont must divest itself of its extensive General Motors stock holdings
These proposals would reduce the amount of tax that DuPont stockholders might have to pay -- from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars
Congressman Wilbur D. Mills chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee asked the Department of Justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law enforcement
The Attorney General responded by letter dated July 19
Copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public
In this letter Mr. Kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments
There are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the Congress not the Department of Justice to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation
Yet your editorial said `` Now the Attorney General writes that no considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ``
What Mr. Kennedy in fact wrote was `` It is the Department 's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ``
The editorial by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement totally distorted Mr. Kennedy 's views
The headline is offensive particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial
Wilmette Aug. 7
-- I concur most heartily with today 's letter on the futility of writing to Sen. Dirksen and Sen. Douglas
But when you write to Congresswoman Church bless her heart your letter is answered fully and completely
Should she disagree she explains why in detail
When she agrees you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged
I think we have the hardest working best representative in Congress
Downers Grove Aug. 8
-- A recent news story reported that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin delayed 103 airplane passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks
They do our country great harm by such actions
Those in the public eye should be good examples of American citizens while abroad
The plane should have started at the scheduled time and left Sinatra and Martin to guzzle
Providence Aug. 5
-- Overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation 's main industries
In covert socialism -- toward which America is moving -- private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them
In order to attract new industries 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise
This is a step toward overt socialism
Issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions
`` Workers of the party ``
to the editor
Sir -- We are writing in reference to a recent `` suggestion `` made to the staff of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences
The day before Election Day to which we are entitled as a legal holiday we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party ``
Being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being we felt this was n't a function of our position
Such tactics reek of totalitarianism
As we understand this directive was given to all city and county employes
To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation
We therefore considered the `` suggestion `` an insult to our intelligence ethics Bill of Rights etc
Our only obligation for this day is to vote free of persuasion for the person we feel is capable in directing the public
This is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the United States
`` Plus-one `` shelters
to the editor
Sir -- I read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters
Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves but ready to demand that `` the community `` help and protect them
Community shelters are of course necessary for those having no space for shelter
If in a town of 2,000 private homes half of them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent
In designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home 's occupants `` plus-one `` -- so he will be able to take in a stranger
I hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of our `` plus-one `` shelter club
to the editor
Sir -- People continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space
It 's simple enough from my point of view
I am for it
It is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman 's world
to the editor
Sir -- When the colonies decided upon freedom from England we insisted through the Declaration of Independence that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity
It is high time the United States began to realize that the God-given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to Katanga
In the United Nations Charter the right of self-determination is also an essential principle
This again applies to Katanga
The people of Katanga had fought for and obtained their freedom from the Communist yoke of Antoine Gizenga and his cohorts
By political economic geographic and natural standards they were justified in doing so
The United States and the U.N. denounce their own principles when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the Katangans
County college costs
to the editor
Sir -- Permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to
The bill which passed the Assembly last May and is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny
The procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers
Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed
none will be elected
The trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate
This board will consist of two of the trustees of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders
It will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders which `` shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes ``
The approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college
Since two of these could be trustees of the college actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue
This is taxation without representation
to the editor
Sir -- Your editorial `` Housing Speedup `` is certainly not the answer to our slum problems
The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions
Change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties
Then see what a boom in all trades as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers will happen
Our entire economy will have a terrific uplift
`` Natural causes ``
to the editor
Sir -- An old man is kicked to death by muggers
The medical examiner states that death was due to `` natural causes ``
I once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in New York it is listed as `` death due to natural causes ``
to the editor
Sir -- Every resident of this city should visit the Newark Museum and see the exhibit `` Our Changing Skyline in Newark ``
It will be at the museum until March 30
It is a revelation of what has been done what is being done and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects plans models and pictures
It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and certainly make every Newarker proud of this city
It should also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious life of the community so that that phase of Newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit
to the editor
Sir -- I hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the Garden State Parkway
Recently I traveled the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and I found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere
One even gave my little dog a biscuit
It was very refreshing
`` Deep Peep Show ``
The viewers of the `` Deep Peep Show `` at 15th and M Streets NW have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp
Twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black coal-like deposit has been encountered
This is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing
The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay
Some of the stumps are as much as three feet long but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments
Although the wood has been changed to coal much of it still retains its original cell structure
In the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time
These microfossils indicate the swamp was `` formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing
The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported in The Washington Post August 2 1955 which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger
Working for peace
Recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air
While I respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points that I would like to question
He said `` Let 's work for peace instead of protection from aggression ``
I would ask `` Why not do both ``
Military power does not cause war
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people
Are we not late especially those of us who call ourselves Friends in doing enough about this lack of understanding
As to protection the speaker disapproved of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone
Is this a reason for saving no one
Would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone
The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face
If the world comes to this would n't it be the very time when courage and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild
Many of our young people think it would
Lastly the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it `` Civilian Defense ``
In 1950 Public Law 920 created Civil Defense different from Civilian-groups of World War 2 a responsibility of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster natural or manmade
Far from creating fear as the speaker suggests preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence
Civil Defense has far to go and many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm flood accident or even war
Pets in apartments
It seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs
I feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone 's apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide
In addition would not the young female public of Washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash
I grant that the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog
I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments
Use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe
Could Senator Humphrey be serious in his proposal
Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists comfort
Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended
The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak
Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat
Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season
As an added suggestion to balance the budget the Government could sell advertising space on the Washington Monument
It is visible throughout the city and men from Madison Ave. would jump at the chance
Sen. Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart
He like most of us wants to be able to sit to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors
Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens
Let us like the French have outdoor cafes where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd
Dissenting views of senators
Two strong dissents from the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee May 2 by Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy of the Thirties did not work
For a neutral Germany
Soviets said to fear resurgence of German militarism
to the editor of the New York Times
For the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity
The United States and Soviet Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations
Recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations
President Kennedy was right when he said `` We shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate ``
I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far East
It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war
The fact is that the Italians French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs
We have no right to criticize them as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war
We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin
It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us
But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting de facto recognition to East Germany
Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation
In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated
The truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism
Berlin is merely being used by Moscow as a stalking horse
Actually the Communists out of fear of a united and armed Germany would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the U.N.
If the Communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed Germany it might well be advantageous for the German people in this nuclear age
It could provide security without cost of armaments and increase German prosperity and lessen taxation
France and other Western European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany
If the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria
President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` Operation Survival `` which has many facets
Why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States
A united Germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world
Meeting U.N. obligations
to the editor of the New York Times
In your editorial of Sept. 30 `` The Smoldering Congo `` you make the following comment `` Far too many states are following the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments
It is up to the Assembly to take action against them
They are violating their Charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion ``
I would like to quote from the Charter of the United Nations
`` Article 17 Section 1
The General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the Organization
`` Section 2
The expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly
`` Article 19
A Member of the United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years ``
The U.S.S.R. and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget
But they refuse as do the Arab states to support the United Nations expenses of maintaining the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer between Egypt and Israel and the U.N. troops in the Congo which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations but by a special budget
According to the official interpretation of the Charter a member can not be penalized by not having the right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the `` special `` United Nations budgets and of course can not be expelled from the Organization which you suggested in your editorial due to the fact that there is no provision in the Charter for expulsion
To aid international law
Connally amendment 's repeal held step toward world order
to the editor of the New York Times
In your Sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress you referred to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril ``
Yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country 's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its Adherence to the Statute of the International Court of Justice
The Connally amendment says that the United States rather than the court shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States in a case before the World Court to which the United States is a party
If the case is thus determined by us to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction
Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United States it also prevents us from using the court effectively
Yet although the Kennedy Administration and the Eisenhower Administration before it have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment as contrary to our best interests no action has yet been taken
Our `` destiny `` in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace with justice under law
To achieve this destiny acts as well as words are needed -- not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect
What better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the Connally amendment -- an act which could expose the United States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court enable us to utilize it and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order
We believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the Eighty-seventh Congress should have included repeal by the Senate of the Connally amendment
For better subway services
to the editor of the New York Times
Many home-bound subway riders utilizing the Flushing-Main Street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their express comes to a stop leaving them stranded and strained
To the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy-fourth Street and change for the IND this takes a daily toll of time and temper
The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation `` hold `` lights at BMT Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth Street stations in Brooklyn
This `` holds `` the local until the express passengers change trains
Without question this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the Woodside station
Phone service criticized
to the editor of the New York Times
As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly from three to four hours a day
In the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service
It has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing
However there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators
I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls special long-distance calls etc
Either it is lack of training lack of proper screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company which does have a Government-blessed monopoly
to the editor
I disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled
The funeral for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price far less than I had expected to pay
But the hospitals and doctors should be
Helping retarded children
to the editor
Recently I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School for retarded children
Hazel Park donates its recreation center five days a week to the school
There is no charge and no state aid
Kiwanis American Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support
There are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school
Reading writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass
They make beautiful objects
Enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon
Southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat
The school is located at 9-1/2 Mile Road Woodward Heights
Visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do
Jobs for Cavanagh
to the editor
I was surprised at Mayor Miriani 's defeat but perhaps Mayor-elect Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago
Maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare DPW and sanitation
Negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great
He should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night
There should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling
Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case
Drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out
Educate the city employes to give real service to the public
After all they are paid by the public they should be examples
Church finds news features are helpful
to the editor
At a recent meeting of the Women 's Association of the Trumbull Ave. United Presbyterian Church considerable use was made of material from The Detroit News on the King James version of the New Testament versus the New English Bible
Some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration the Daily Prayer and Three Minutes A Day as being very helpful
We feel that The Detroit News is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines
to the editor
Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence
How old do you have to be to remember when Americans especially children were encouraged to be polite
Why has this form of gentility gone out of American life
How can we old-fashioned parents who still feel that adults are due some respect from children battle the new type of advertising that appears on TV without denying the children the use of television entirely
Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern `` parents they have observed
From necessity they are also inspired by the `` hard-sell `` attitude of the sponsor so finally it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising
Dunes park advocate
to the editor
I commend Senator Hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area
Ghost town
To the editor of the Inquirer
I just wish to congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles
We have now a quiet city fewer automobiles less congestion and fewer retail customers shopping in center city
Good for Mr Trimmer
Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost `` town
Defends big trucks
to the editor of the Inquirer
I worked on the Schuylkill Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there would n't be an Expressway
Without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future
Mr. George Hough Oct. 30 sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop
The trucks today help pay for this highway
They try to keep within the speed limits
Although today 's trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road
Out of school at 14
to the editor of the Inquirer
The letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter `` simpleton `` instead of `` simplicitude ``
Such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden
There are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for the dropouts
What we need is more vocational training in high schools not more dropouts
to the editor of the Inquirer
I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly can not see how two wrongs can make a right
I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is
Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children
If an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it
As I see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary
Why do we need bigger and better bombs
I repeat two wrongs do not make a right
we tremble not
to the editor of the Inquirer
Everyone should take time to read Martin Luther 's Hymn `` A Mighty Fortress Is Our God ``
Especially the first half of the third verse
out of the race
to the editor of the Inquirer
To our everlasting shame we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Having led the world in this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race
Are we to be the master of the atom or will the atom be our master -- and destroy us
Why trust Jagan
To the editor of the Inquirer
Just because Cheddi Jagan new boss of British Guiana was educated in the United States is no reason to think he is n't a Red
We have quite a few home-grown specimens of our own
If we go all gooey over this newest Castro until he proves he is n't we 've got rocks in our heads
How many times must we get burned before we learn
Russia and U.N
to the editor of the Inquirer
Just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start one
The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides
Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan London or Pearl Harbor
That is why the United Nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war
Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world
Why are n't the Soviets expelled from the U.N.
to the editor of the Inquirer
While `` better late than never `` may have certain merits the posthumous award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation
Had it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the United Nations was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and in many ways thankless task
According to one report however Mr. Hammarskjold was considered `` too controversial `` a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring
Actually of course that label `` controversial `` applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the Soviet Union
At Khrushchev 's door therefore can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated
It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed
As has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy
people to people
to the editor of the Inquirer
Just a brief note of appreciation to Vice President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver Bashir Ahmad for providing a first-class example of `` people to people `` good will
If only this could be done more often -- with such heartening results -- many of the earth 's `` big problems `` would shrink to the insignificances they really are
Thanks for your good coverage of Ahmad 's visit too
Expressway answer East River Drive
to the editor of the Inquirer
Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway are valuable
however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition
One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea
We shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice
They start on the East side of the Schuylkill have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over again to the East at their destination
Bridges tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings
Each one of these is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion
We should avoid these congestion points or putting it another way keep cars starting and ending on the East side of the river -- on the East side
This can be accomplished by several logical steps 1
Widen the East River Drive at least one lane
2
So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems
3
Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges
One additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent
4
This could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the East River Drive
Shadow over Washington Square
to the editor of the Inquirer
I wish to advocate two drastic changes in Washington Square 1
Take away George Washington 's statue
Replace it with the statue of one or another of the world 's famous dictators
There 's no sense in being reminded of times that were
Washington Square seems not part of a free land
It may remind one of Russia China or East Berlin
but it ca n't remind one of the freedom that Washington and the Continental soldiers fought for
The Fairmount Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square
The matter may seem a small thing to some people I know but it 's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism The Commission has posted signs in Washington Square saying
The Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in This square
Fairmount Park Commission
Does each tentacle of the octopus of City Government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance
If birds do n't belong in a Square or Park what does
They are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature
The trees are their homes
but the Commission does not share such sentiments
The whole official City apparently has an intense hatred toward birds
Starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon from City Hall
Just a preliminary measure
If any are left presently we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too
The City Government is not united in an all-out to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs delinquents thugs murderers rapists subversives
Indeed no
Let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive
Of course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we 're afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say `` How come
What 's your motive
Who wants this deed done ``
-- in this small way do the leaders of a city or of a nation inure the masses to watching or even inflicting torture and death upon even their fellow men
One means to help the birds occurs to me Let the chimes that ring over Washington Square twice daily discontinue any piece of music but one
Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began the hymn `` Abide With Me ``
We will know and He will know to whom it is rendered what the birds would ask
not push-ups but stand-ups
to the editor of the Inquirer
There is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans are too `` soft ``
Unfortunately those who would remedy our `` softness `` seek to do so with calisthenics
They are working on the wrong part of our anatomy
It is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft
Ashamed of our wealth and power afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies
When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation when we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war and when we realize that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom then and only then will we no longer be `` soft ``
America does n't need to `` push-up `` she needs to stand up
Disputes Stans column business scandal views
to the editor
The new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit
However he states unequivocally `` the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor ``
I must in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals
The area most prominently commented on during the McClellan hearings had to do with `` sweetheart contracts ``
These arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes
A sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute
Anyone familiar with the details of the McClellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders
Further it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum-Griffin Act
Escalation unto death
The nuclear war is already being fought except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet
It is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories
They predicted escalation and escalation is what we are getting
The biggest nuclear device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons although our B-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece
Some time ago however Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made the Soviet Union would make them
He seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand since we can not assume that he has exploded his entire stock
And now of course the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side
Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb
So be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety and neutron bombs which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing
So escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds
What is needed Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell Daily Sun October 26 is a discontinuity
The escalation must end sometime and probably quite soon
`` Only a discontinuity can end it `` Professor Morrison writes
`` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction or that of diplomatic policy ``
Morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- Europe of course must be written off out of hand
He feels therefore that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take
His proposal is opposed to that of Richard Nixon Governor Rockefeller past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr. Edward Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war
These gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale all in the name of national security
Escalation is their first love and their last
they will be faithful unto death
Capable as their minds may be in some directions these guardians of the nation 's security are incapable of learning or even of observing
If this capacity had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation
He has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges
But if his purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously
Not terror but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere
Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps
When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another it is only natural
Thus when the Russians sent up their first sputnik American chagrin was human enough and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable
But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly
The tide turns
When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists
They are less vocal now when it is the West Berliners who are migrating
The flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic
West Berlin morale is low and in age distribution the situation is unfavorable
Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin 's 2,200,000 residents are sixty-five or older only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen
R. H. S. Crossman M.P writing in The Manchester Guardian states that departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 but of 1,700 a week and applications to leave have risen to 1,900 a week
The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people
Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead
The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany but the hard truth says Crossman is that `` The closing off of East Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East German as distinct from Russian troops was a major Communist victory which dealt West Berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow
The gallant half-city is dying on its feet ``
Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in The Observer London
Mark Arnold-Foster writes `` People are leaving West Berlin because they think it is dying
They are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months front-line work in factories in West Berlin
Berlin 's resilience is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed ``
The handwriting is on the wall
The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city
State Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks into East Berlin under military escort will not avail
Tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful
The materials for compromise are at hand The Nation Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators see Alan Clark on p. 367 have spelled them out again and again
A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph but it will save Berlin
Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence if that is what the West wants
The removal of Stalin 's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history
It is in fact a relatively mild chastisement of the dead
A British writer Richard Haestier in a book Dead Men Tell Tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding the French Revolution the body of Henry 4 who had died nearly 180 years earlier was torn to pieces by a mob
And in England after the Restoration the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn
The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows
Contemplating these posthumous punishments Stalin should not lose all hope
In 1899 Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster facing Whitehall and there presumably he still stands
Nikita Khrushchev however has created yet another problem for himself
The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy Moscow is a crowded city and the creed of Communism deplores waste
Who will take Stalin 's place beside Lenin
There is Karl Marx of course buried in London
The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable
Who then is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin
Who but Nikita himself
Since he has just shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people
Besides he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which what with exhumations and rehabilitations seems to match that of life
Suppose he did lie beside Lenin would it be permanent
If some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession
When a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put
If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand
U Thant of Burma
The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N. 's Acting Secretary General -- at this writing the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends
Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running but France did n't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter
With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto
What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy
In all the bitter in-fighting the squabbles over election procedures the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries theme the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat
He has moreover another qualification which augurs well for the future
He is a Buddhist which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung
U Thant of course will hold office until the spring of 1963 when Mr. Hammarskjold 's term would have come to an end
Whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen
Mr. Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant not dead
the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents
In a sense the showdown promised by Mr. Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided
no precedents have been set as yet
structurally the U.N. is still fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it
But at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong
To the hills girls
No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade
These are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it as Messrs. Salsich and Engh report on page 372
Even in areas where political connotations are deliberately
left vague the spirit of vigilantism is spreading
Friends a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley Alabama
`` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast `` the account reads `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls
Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving Civil Defense outfit 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute 's notice ``
According to Friends the unit was organized by John Snook a former World War 2 commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company
The girls very fetching in their uniforms are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck
they are also trained with carbines automatic weapons pistols rifles and other such ladies accessories
This may be opera bouffe now but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy
The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means
The doctrine has never worked
it is not working now
The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms
it can not bring them into actual play
A more dangerous formula for national frustration can not be imagined
As the civic temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real
Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst
All false gods resemble Moloch at least in the early phases of their careers so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice
But there is reason in all things and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands
The annual butchery of 40,000 American men women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive
a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient
No other popular idol is accorded even that much grace
If the railroads for example regularly slaughtered 25,000 passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States
But by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily
Yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic without being fanatical
Here then is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning
From next New Year 's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways publicizing it on all media of communication
To avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse
but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners
Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on July 4 1963
The scene of course should be nine miles northwest of Centralia Illinois the geographical center of population according to the census
A special grandstand protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of Illinois should be erected for occupancy by honored guests who should include the ambassadors of all those new African nations as yet not quite convinced that the United States is thoroughly civilized
The band should play the Rogues March as a processional switching to `` Hail Columbia Happy Land ``
As the trap is sprung
Independence Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes subversive of that end it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it
The highway system is an agency of government and when it grinds up 40,000 Americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do
Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for the better
Moreover the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social
It would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis or as it is generally termed staying put
True the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor even a miniscule sect and their credo `` Home-keeping hearts are happiest `` is as disreputable as Socinianism
Nonetheless although few in number they are a stubborn crew as tenacious of life as the Hardshell Baptists which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith
Perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia Robert Ruark 's grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is `` all this gallivantin ``
In any event the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith
Somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason
Since appeals to morality to humanity and to sanity have had such small effect perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example
If we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive say beyond 25,000 per annum then somebody is going to hang it follows that the more eminent the victim the more impressive the lesson
To hang 50 Governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways
so all things considered the highway commissioners would seem to be elected
As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race
But the guilt is shared by the United States Britain and France the other members of the atomic club
Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1 the US and UK had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the Russians and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down
As it descends the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body
for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies
The effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations
So while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr. Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat
Shock dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions
a holier-than-thou sermon was not
On October 19 after the Soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices Ambassador Stevenson warned the UN General Assembly that this country in `` self protection `` might have to resume above-ground tests
More recently the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg `` admitted `` to a news conference in Las Vegas Nevada that the US might fall behind Russia he apparently meant in weapons development if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain
The trial balloons are afloat
All of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood
But for the average citizen unfortunately this is one of science 's worst-marked channels full of tricky currents and unknown depths
The scientists in and out of government do not agree on some of the most vital points at least publicly
On the one hand the Public Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern `` or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the Aj
But the PHS conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United States ``
Then it added `` It is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected ``
Having hedged its bets in this way PHS apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all `` At present radiation levels and even at somewhat higher levels the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected ``
Then to conclude on an indeterminate note `` Nevertheless if fallout increased substantially or remained high for a long time it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world ``
Dr. Linus Pauling a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry has been less ambiguous whether you choose to agree with him or not
After declaring in an article last month in Frontier Magazine that the Russian testing `` carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world `` he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons
The damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects
Long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia
Most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere where the fallout is concentrating
Pauling 's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be too high but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility
The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn
But more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem
Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing
An illustration of this attitude is found in John A. McCone 's letter to Dr. Thomas Lauritsen reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of The New Republic
To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout
A recent study on radiation exposure by the AEC 's division of biology and medicine stated `` The question of the biological effect of radiation doses is not considered `` herein
Of course the AEC is in a bind now
If it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests
So the Commission 's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences with the fission yield usually left vague
Now of course that the Russians are the nuclear villains radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid when the US was testing in the atmosphere
The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout if not exactly good for you might not be much worse than a bad cold
After a nuclear blast one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof
Things are n't that simple anymore
Yet if Washington gets too indignant about Soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count
How much fallout will we get
As of October 25 the AEC had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series 12 of them in a megaton range including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of TNT
and President Kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported
Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons
Some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons and that the full 50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated
If the new Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian tests the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far
To this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in November 1958
Resuming atmospheric tests
One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself
That dilemma is as much with us as ever
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50 's -- the United States appeared to have three choices
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination
Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security
This third choice was in fact made
With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks however the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken
Once again the United States must choose
And once again the choices are much the same
Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder
The first choice abandoning tests entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely be exploited by the Russians
The second choice full testing has become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere
The third choice negotiation presupposes as Russian behavior demonstrates a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable
We take the position however that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us
It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable
Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice
one which should it fail will not have contaminated the conscience
That is the contamination we most fear
Leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice
For that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans are now proposing
In particular Governor Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests
Speaking recently in Miami Governor Rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests ``
Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion he argued that the responsibility of the United States is `` to do confidently and firmly not what is popular but what is right ``
What was missing in the Governor 's argument as in so many similar arguments was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right
The possibility as he asserted that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless of course we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand
Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor 's case one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary
Recent statements by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have to the contrary assured us that our lead is very great
Unless the Administration and the Defense Department have been deceiving us the facts do not support the assertion that we are `` compelled `` to resume atmospheric testing
It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may at some point in the future be necessary and even justifiable
But a resumption does not seem justifiable now
What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations
We now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake
This is an ethical demand which can not be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of Communism
Too often in the past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part
There ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what Russia does
The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start
when his Holiness Pope John 23 first called for an Ecumenical Council and at the same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate
With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom
But as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides
The Council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the Church
As it has turned out however the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses
Two things have happened in recent months to bring the Council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy
First of all it is now known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity
Far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light
Equally significant Pope John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity
A major aim of the Council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity
Secondly a whole series of addresses and actions by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the Church
The establishment by the Holy Father of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern
The designation of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches assembly in New Delhi as `` official `` observers reverses the Church 's earlier stand
The public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Cicognani for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion was still another remarkable act
Nor can one forget Pope John 's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury
Augustin Cardinal Bea the director of the Secretariate for Christian Unity has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the Church 's stance toward the Protestant and Orthodox Churches
Noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone
For discouragement or the temptation to abandon our efforts `` would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of God the irresistible efficacy of prayer the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit ``
Can any Christian fail to respond to these words
The budget deficit
the administration 's official budget review which estimates a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year is n't making anyone happy
Certainly it is n't making the President happy and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year
We sympathize with Mr. Kennedy but we feel bound to say that his budget review does n't please us either although for very different reasons
Furthermore we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring
In the first place a large part of the discrepancy between President Eisenhower 's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President 's farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor
The Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received
The rest of the deficit is also easily understood
Four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the Eisenhhower Administration quite apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere
Four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a responsibility similarly neglected by Mr. Eisenhower
The farm program will cost an additional 1.5 billion because of unusual weather factors the Food for Peace program and other new measures
Anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar deficit
Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures
And yet Mr. Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up `` and `` economizing ``
We wish the President would remember that `` fiscal responsibility `` was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election
The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier
Ethics and peace
introduction of the `` dialogue `` principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington the last weekend in October
Two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent Protestants and when the speaker was a Catholic one `` discussant `` on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion
Several effects were immediately evident
Sessions devoted to `` Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends `` `` Moral Principle and Political Judgment `` `` Christian Ethics in the Cold War `` and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves
Usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker or discussion leader
In the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law which Dr. William V. O'Brien of Georgetown University advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy
That Aristotelean-Thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants but in the end the concept came to reassert itself
Speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it if perhaps by some other name
A Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and application in the Islamic tradition as the `` divine law `` while a C.A.I.P member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new U.N. nations told of its widespread recognition on the African continent
The impression was unmistakable that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence
Another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself
The stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable
It was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other 's positions and better comprehension of one 's own
But a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues
One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical `` atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend Berlin for example
the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account
it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative
Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question
I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or even of hypocrisy
I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke though granted they were almost all members of the official family who presumably harbor official thoughts
But I questioned also professional soldiers who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian 's dreamy irredentism
Their answer was it can be done and we will do it
And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek `` In America `` I said `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland
What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that and that it can be done ``
He smiled
He always smiles -- at least at visitors I gather
He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me who asked the most asinine questions
I recalled sympathetically the Duke 's complaint in Browning 's `` My Last Duchess ``
He smiled and said a word or two to the interpreter who turned to me `` The President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei ``
That I smarted is a royal rebuff if ever there was one
I answered the routine question about my itinerary rather coolly
Chiang spoke again this time at greater length
`` The President says `` the translator came in `` that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia and that everywhere you went you would seek the answer to your question
He says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound determination to go to the Mainland and his faith that that return is feasible he would merely sound redundant
So you yourself must seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions
Any information we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal ``
Fair enough
What are the relevant data
For every person on Taiwan there are sixty in Mainland China
If the raw population figures are crucially relevant then it is idle to think of liberation as idle as to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia
Relative military manpower
Less than 60-1 but at least 6-1
The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese army
Say four million
The armed forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450,000 though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated
Skill
Training
Morale
It is generally conceded that the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia and the army the best trained
The morale is very high
Even so it adds up to impossible odds except that the question arises On whose side would the Mainland Chinese army fight
The miserable people of China the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play can not themselves resist overtly
They think perforce of physical survival everything else is secondary
But the army which Mao continues to feed well where are its sympathies
The psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivated in China over thousands of years
It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization
Every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives who are close to starvation
The soldiers themselves can not stage a successful rebellion it is assumed but will their discontent spread to the officer class
The immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed a despot does not economize on his generals
But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews
Their privations are almost beyond endurance
In behalf of what
Leninism-Marxism as understood by Exegete Mao
To whom will the generals stay loyal
There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out on the farm
It is another question whether `` they `` -- or a single general off in a corner of China secure for a few galvanizing
days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the Party
But the disposition to rebel is most definitely there
But there must be a catalytic pressure
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal
The first was the commune program which will ensure agricultural poverty for years
The family is largely broken up
and where it is not it is left with no residue and the social meaning of this is enormous
For it is the family that in China has always provided social security for the indigent the sick the down-and-out members of the clan
Now the government must do that
but the government is left with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it has ordained
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security
The second mistake is Tibet
Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state
A friendly state sometimes only semi-independent but never hostile
China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people 's religion and institutions
Red China is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed
Tibet is too vast the terrain is too difficult
Tibet may bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France
These continuing pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep China in a heightening state of tension
The imposition of yet another pressure a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap
The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men
They know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control
First and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime
On these they feel they can rely
Secondly they depend on America 's `` moral cooperation `` when the crucial moment arrives
They hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest we will receive the opportunity gladly
I remarked jocularly to the President that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd day
He affected most properly not to understand my point
But he -- and all of China -- wears the scars of American indecisiveness and he knows what an uncertain ally we are
We have been grand to Formosa itself -- lots of aid and most of the time a policy of support for the offshore islands
But our outlook has been and continues to be defensive
A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy 's views on the world struggle
The Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux and are poised to strike
There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation
The moment of truth is the moment of crisis
During the slow buildup the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details fine words strutting gestures
The crisis burns these suddenly away
There the truth is open to eyes that are willing to look
The moment passes
New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones
A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for a couple of days this month to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies
Before memory too clouds over let us make a note or two of what could be seen
The measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of public men at many levels
One knows better now who has bone and who has jelly in his spine
But I am here concerned more with policy than with men
Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain
Now everyone knows -- or knew in the week of December 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy
The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in Africa moreover where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved
Of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations
But in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U.S. was in reality the principal
The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our NATO allies to the entire Western community
By our policy the West was -- is -- split
But the key revelation is not new
The controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November 1956
It reappears in whole or part whenever a new crisis exposes the reality in Cuba last spring with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired
at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles
in relation to Laos Algeria South Africa
right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana
What the moments reveal
This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows Under prevailing policy the U.S. can take the initiative against the Right but can not take the initiative against the Left
It makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form of regime what particular issue
The U.S. can not take the initiative against the Left
There is even some question whether the U.S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left
We can attack Tshombe but not Gigenza
No matter that Gizenga is Moscow 's man in the Congo
No matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men
No matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western interests in Africa
Even granted that the Congo should be unified you do n't protect Western security by first removing the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium
We can force Britain and France out of the Suez but we can not so much as try to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest
We can mass our fleet against the Trujillos but not against the Castros
We can vote in the UN against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule in Angola but we can not even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall -- much less give the simple order to push the Wall down
We officially receive the anti-French Moscow-allied Algerian FLN but we denounce the pro-Europe anti-Communist OAS as criminal
In the very week of our war against Katanga we make a 133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah who has just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship
As our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-Western Katangans we stand supinely bleating while Nehru 's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our NATO ally Portugal
What explains this uni-directional paralysis
It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy
The Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration but only made more consistent and more active
Key to the puzzles
Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa Katanga and Ghana as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia Africa and Latin America
From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted `` `` neutralist `` `` contested `` nations especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- Nehru Tito Nkrumah Sukarno Betancourt etc
Our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes
If we grasp this orientation as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible
And it becomes clear why in general we can not take the initiative against the Left
To write a play the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it
Nowadays more and more all he needs is someone else 's book
To get started he does not scan the world about him
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists
So far this season Broadway 's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays
Best from abroad
Of straight dramas there are All The Way Home which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel A Death In The Family
The Wall awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel
Advise And Consent lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller
Face Of A Hero closed based on a Pierre Boulle novel
The only original works attempting to reach any stature Tennessee Williams disappointing domestic comedy Period Of Adjustment and Arthur Laurents clever but empty Invitation To A March
Clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- A Taste Of Honey by Britain 's young 19 when she wrote it Shelagh Delaney
Becket by France 's Jean Anouilh
The Hostage closed by Ireland 's Brendan Behan
Among the musicals Camelot came from T. H. White 's The Once And Future King and novels were the sources of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi
Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals but pretty bad leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce
The only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- Send Me No Flowers closed Under The Yum-Yum Tree Critic 's Choice
In the forthcoming The Conquering Hero and Carnival Broadway is not even adapting books but reconverting old movies Hail The Conquering Hero and Lili
Dry of life
Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad
Some memorable plays have been drawn from books notably Life With Father and Diary Of Anne Frank
And particularly in the musical field adaptations have long been the rule from Die Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma and My Fair Lady
As Critic Walter Kerr points out `` Adaptations so long as they are good still qualify as creative ``
And other defenders invariably argue that after all Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too
The difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world
most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book squeeze it dry of life and add only one contribution of their own stage technique
The most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers can not afford to take chances
But that explanation is only partly true
Off-Broadway where production is still comparatively cheap is proving itself only slightly more original
Laudably enough it is offering classics and off-beat imports but last week only one U.S. original was on the boards Robert D. Hock 's stunning Civil War work Borak
The real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U.S. playwrights
the Cooch Terpers
He `` Come with me to the Casbah ``
She `` By subway or cab ``
That exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan as more and more New Yorkers were discovering 29th Street and Eighth Avenue where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian Nights Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American inpost of belly dancing
Several more will open soon
Their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis
The belly boites with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted Ionic columns heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families
Customers often bring their children
between performances enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces
Except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor the people watch in calm absorption
Small shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time using guitars violins and more alien instruments with names that would open Sesame the oud grandfather of the lute
the darbuka a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass
the def a low-pitched tambourine
The girls sit quietly with the musicians wearing prim dresses or plain secretarial shifts until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem
Continuum of mankind
If a dancer is good she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny -- the continuum of mankind
But a great many of what Variety calls the `` Cooch Terpers `` are considerably less cosmic than that
Each dancer follows the ancient Oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates and through breathing and muscle control she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room
This is done at varying speeds ranging from the slow and fast Shifte Telli a musical term meaning double strings to the fastest ecstatic Karshilama meaning greetings or welcome
The New York dancers are highly eclectic varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations back bends or floor crawls
But they do not strip
The striptease is crass
the belly dance leaves more to the imagination
When a dancer does well she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers costumes
With tips the girls average between 150 and 200 a week depending on basic salary
Although they are forbidden to sit with the customers the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy
The melting pot
All over the country belly clubs have never been bigger especially in Detroit Boston and Chicago and even in small towns
one of the best dancers a Turkish girl named Semra works at a roadhouse outside Bristol Conn.
The girls are kept booked and moving by several agents notably voluble black-bearded Murat Somay a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the central abdomen
He can offer nine Turkish girls plans to import at least 15 more
But a great many of the dancers are more or less native
Sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis conducted by Lebanese and Syrians in the U.S. where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs
As the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly
Some Manhattan examples
Jemela surname Gerby 23 seems Hong Kong Oriental but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother was born in America and educated at Holy Cross Academy and Textile High School says she learned belly dancing at family picnics
Serene Mrs. Wilson 23 was born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan
Daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the New York Casbah with dark eyes and dark waist-length hair the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe glimmering body
Many belly dancers are married but Serene is one of the few who will admit it
Marlene surname Adamo 25 a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris now lives on Manhattan 's West Side is about the best belly dancer working the Casbah loves it so much that she dances on her day off
She has the small highly developed body of a prime athlete and holds in contempt the `` girls who just move sex ``
Leila Malia Phillips 25 is a Greenwich Village painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles
A graduate of Hollywood High School she likes to imagine herself as she takes the floor `` a village girl coming in to a festival ``
Gloria surname Ziraldo circa 30 who was born in Italy and once did `` chorus work `` in Toronto has been around longer than most of the others wistfully remembers the old days when `` we used to get the seamen from the ships you know with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all
But the ships are very slow now and we do n't get so many sailors any more ``
The uptown crowd has moved in and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar
A short tormented span
Of the handful of painters that Austria has produced in the 20th century only one Oskar Kokoschka is widely known in the U.S.
This state of unawareness may not last much longer
For ten years a small group of European and U.S. critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele who died 42 years ago at the age of 28
The critics campaign finally inspired the first major U.S. exhibit of Schiele 's works
The show has been to Boston and Manhattan will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis
Last week it opened at the J B Speed Museum in Louisville at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix Landau gallery in Los Angeles
Schiele 's paintings are anything but pleasant
His people see color are angular and knobby-knuckled sometimes painfully stretched sometimes grotesquely foreshortened
His colors are dark and murky and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom
But he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time and even after nearly half a century the tense tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination
The devil himself
The son of a railway stationmaster Schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of Tulln 14 miles northwest of Vienna
He was an emotional lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork
When he was 15 his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna
Even there he did not last for long
Cried one professor after a few months of Student Schiele 's tantrums and rebellion `` The devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ``
For a while his work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists and by the patterned mosaic-like paintings of Gustav Klimt then the dean of Austrian art
Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter
His pictures were roundly denounced as `` the most disgusting things one has ever seen in Vienna ``
He himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle
For years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna 's gutters
Drafted into the Austrian army he rebelliously rejected discipline wangled a Vienna billet went on painting
It was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show
Melancholy obsession
The unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy and it was too much even for morbid-minded Vienna
He was obsessed by disease and poverty by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust
The children he painted were almost always in rags his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy contorted and strangely pathetic
The subject he liked most was the female body which he painted in every state -- naked half-dressed muffled to the ears sitting primly in a chair lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace
The most surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much in its own way as the Twentieth Congress of 1956 which ended with that famous `` secret `` report on Stalin
The publication last July of the party 's Draft Program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism `` -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime a solemn consecration of ideas which had in fact been current over the last three or four years i.e since the defeat of the `` anti-party group `` in all theoretical party journals
These never ceased to suggest that if in the eyes of Marx and Lenin `` full communism `` was still a very distant ideal the establishment of a Communist society had now under Khrushchev become an `` immediate and tangible reality ``
It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was in fact very largely a rehash of that interminable document
He and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` All People 's State `` and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization `` of the whole hierarchy of Soviets starting with the Supreme Soviet itself
Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy `` and would enable `` the people `` to take a more direct and active part in running the country
Also elections would be more democratic
there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from
No doubt there was still a lot in the Draft Program -- and in Khrushchev 's speech -- which left many points obscure
Was it the party 's intention for example to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes i.e state farms which were moreover to be progressively `` urbanized ``
As we know the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot
and it is still very far from certain how valid the party 's claim is that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes `` the peasants are finding it more profitable to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm
If one follows the reports of the Congress one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter
The Draft Program was interesting in other respects too
It contained for example a number of curious admissions about the peasants who enjoy no sickness benefits no old-age pensions no paid holidays
they still benefit far less than the `` other `` 50 per cent of the nation from that `` welfare state `` which the Soviet Union so greatly prides itself on being
Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly
and though he repeated over and over again the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 the `` ordinary `` people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how `` communism `` is really going to work in practice especially in respect of food
Would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry
This was something on which K. himself seemed to have some doubts
for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears `` of those responsible for agricultural production
And as we know the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped
One can not but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev 's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group `` -- Molotov Malenkov Kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov
Molotov in particular is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services to increase rents and fares
in fact with having been against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev `` welfare state ``
The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story what in the secret councils of the Kremlin Molotov had really proposed we just do n't know and he has had no chance to reply
But one can not escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party `` group would be totally unnecessary if there were not inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism `` and last but not least on foreign policy
The whole problem of `` peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition `` with the capitalist world is in the very center of this Congress
Mikoyan declared
`` Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather the absence of war at a given moment and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war
His views in fact coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence who look upon it merely as a variant of the `` cold war `` or of an `` armed peace ``
One can not help wondering whether Molotov and the rest of the `` anti-party group `` are not being used as China 's whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers
For something clearly has gone very very seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese relations which were never easy and have now deteriorated
The effect of Chou En-lai 's clash with Khrushchev together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov Co. has shifted the whole attention of the world including that of the Soviet people from the `` epoch-making `` twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict
Not only as we know did Chou En-lai publicly treat Khrushchev 's attack on Albania as `` something that we can not consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach `` to the problem i.e as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic `` but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev calling him a liar a bully and so on
It is extremely doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends
The big question is whether in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet solidarity the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev -- or get rid of Enver Hoxa
These seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident `` can now be closed
But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between China and Russia
There are other symptoms
Khrushchev for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence `` and would like above all the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully
he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the Russo-American `` honeymoon `` of 1959
But it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from China but perhaps also from that `` China Lobby `` which I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago exists on the quiet inside the party
To these people solidarity and unity with China should be the real basis of Russia 's future policy
And the Chinese as the Albanian incident shows have strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure a `` shameful `` peace with the West
The fact that China which is obsessed by Formosa -- to Khrushchev a very small matter should be supported by North Korea and North Vietnam is highly indicative
And one can not but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky who was blowing hot and cold exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the West was n't trying to keep the Chinese quiet
And this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb
Was not this dropped primarily in order to `` appease `` the Chinese -- especially after `` Khrushchev 's `` humiliating `` surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31
What does it all add up to
Indications are that Khrushchev and with him the bulk of the Soviet people favor peaceful coexistence and with the exception of Berlin the maintenance of the status quo in the world
The Chinese North Vietnamese and North Koreans on the other hand feel that militarily Russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation `` they would like to embark on before long with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries
Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 when the `` anti-party group `` nearly liquidated him
He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition
but if he is up against China 's crusading spirit in world affairs he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life
He may support China but he wo n't
he may break with China which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous or he may succeed by all kinds of dangerous concessions in persuading China to be patient
The next days may show where things stand
On a misty Sunday morning last month a small band of militant anti-Communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here
Eleven men a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold damp fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare
To the average American this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday night TV movie
But to the Minutemen this is a serious business
They feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy
They feel that World War 3 has already begun and they are setting themselves up as a `` last line of defense `` against the Communist advance
Their national leader Robert Bolivar DePugh of Norborne Mo says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught
In their maneuvers last month they wore World War 2 camouflage garb and helmets and carried unloaded M-1 rifles
The maneuvers were held `` in secret `` after a regional seminar for the Minutemen held in nearby Shiloh Ill. had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs who had arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of Collinsville Ill. and seized four operative weapons including a Browning machine gun two Browning automatic rifles and an M-4 rifle
Undismayed by this contretemps a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli 's home at 6:30 A.M. the next day put on their uniforms and headed for a farm several miles away
A 60 mm mortar and a 57 mm recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along
The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated
After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War 2 army jeep down soggy trails the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long low ridge and a creek-filled gully
Here the two leaders DePugh and Lauchli hastened to put the group through its paces
The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment
They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge
They practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades
and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment
Eleven dummy rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting
Mrs. DePugh the mother of five children and an active member of her husband 's organization participated in all the exercises
There were no `` casualties `` but the `` guerrillas `` admitted to being `` a little tired `` when the leaders called a halt at 9 A.M. to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane
Tenure as criterion
I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk Dec. 16
It has to do with teachers salaries and tenure
Next September after receiving a degree from Yale 's Master of Arts in Teaching Program I will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers
I will also be underpaid
The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers
Teaching is at present a sellers market
as a result buyers the public must be satisfied with second-rate teachers
But this is not the real problem
the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality
Hence all teachers good and bad who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary
I am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country the profession is grossly overpaid
It follows that teachers as a group can not expect any marked salary increases
there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance
The only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them
The only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure
Here as in all sectors of the economy quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses
Loss of initiative
On the eve of the `` great debate `` on the proposal to give the President broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the Atlantic Community we should face the alternatives on this proposition
What we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate
Without this power we lay open any American industry which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others
It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs
A brief for the negative
I disagree with Mr. Burnham 's position on the Common Market Nov. 18 as a desirable organization for us to join
For him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult to understand
The pressure for our entry to the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare `` or garden path with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background
The appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal as well as economic self-rule
In entering this union we will be surrendering most if not all of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the Atlantic Institute recently set up or the O.E.C.D I.M.F and others
To think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking
If it is not enough that all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join this market I refer you to an article in the New York Times magazine section Nov. 12 1961 by Mr. Eric Johnston entitled `` We Must Join The Common Market ``
He says `` It has swept aside petty nationalisms age-old rivalries and worn-out customs ``
Referring to Britain he says `` We see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy placing this authority in Continental hands ``
Since the goal of our international planners is a World Government this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in that direction for once American economic autonomy is absorbed a larger grouping is a question of time
Frankly it is being very cleverly done for in a sense they have us over a barrel
Listen to what Mr. Johnston has to say `` Consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict
We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need
We would be crippled by reduced output industrial decline widespread unemployment ``
But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community or `` economic empire `` but merely what libertarians like Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises have been arguing for years an end to government regulations an end to government competition in industry and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry
Create a free market here give us a sound debt-free money system and we 'll compete with anyone Europe and Asia combined
In short get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we wo n't have to worry about European competition or Communism either
If we want to preserve our sovereignty this is the way to do it
not acquiesce to an international planning board
If we go into this Common Market we might just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees Connally Amendments or for that matter conservatism in general
We welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the Atlantic Common Market which JNR will be continuing in our pages

In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two years honorably on Active Duty I was not required to participate in any further Army Reserve activities
Now more than five years later I can not in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier
But in spite of this I at present a man 31 years of age and a College Professor have been recalled `` by direction of the President `` to report on November 25th to Fort Devens Massachusetts for another twelve months of Active Duty as an Sp 4 the equivalent of a PFC
Today seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee I am Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science at St. Michael 's College
For after leaving the Army in 1956 I spent five years in Graduate School first at Boston College and then at the University of Toronto
This time added to that which I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 makes a total of twenty-two 22 years of education
The possibility of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys
With this no loyal citizen can quarrel
However it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes ``
In my own case I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking
Taken back into the Army now as an Sp 4 I am leaving 110 college students whose teacher I am
A wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes
At this late date it is impossible for St. Michael 's College to find a suitable replacement for me
Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- I can not help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone mad
Mercenary term of honor
In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to as mercenaries
This confuses me no end
If the Hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government to fight for England in the 1770 's were mercenaries what shall we call the UN troops sent to the Congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the United Nations
If the UN troops are not mercenaries then the Hessians were not mercenaries either
And if the foreigners fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries then Lafayette and Von Steuben were mercenaries too as were also the members of the Lafayette Escadrille in the early part of World War 1 and of Chennault 's Flying Tigers in the early days of World War 2
Modern postal slogan
It does n't take a Gore Vidal to tell you what 's wrong with Cherokee Textile 's slogan Pitney-Bowes Objects `` July 1
It 's an eighteenth-century negative man
Suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment By moving the term `` Republic `` to lower case substituting the modern phrase `` move ahead `` for the stodgy `` keep `` and by using the Postmaster 's name on every envelope in caps of course with the `` in spite `` as faded as possible the slogan can not fail
The impending death of Pope
In the issue of March 5 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said
`` On trial in Jakarta for having flown for the Indonesian anti-Communist insurgents U.S. pilot Alan Lawrence Pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of Indonesia
Facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty he said I have participated in the war against Communism in Korea and at Dienbienphu and I have helped in the evacuation of North Vietnamese to the free world
I have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by Communist domination
At least in Indonesia Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with Communism ``
Since then nothing has happened to save the life of Pope
I found recently a very small article in the New York Times
`` U.S. Flier Loses Plea
Indonesia Court Upholds Pope 's Death Sentence
-- Indonesia Military Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan Lawrence Pope an American pilot
Pope was convicted last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying bombing missions
He has been in prison since May 1958 when his aircraft was shot down over Moluccas
He may appeal to President Sukarno for clemency ``
As we see Pope may appeal to President Sukarno Khrushchev 's friend for clemency
This possibility is anything but reassuring
The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters
But who will act now and immediately to save the life of Alan Pope
Are tractors available for him
Does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-Communist American pilot
A few days before I saw your mention of what Texas Liberals were doing to promote `` Louis Capet `` The Week `` June 3 another analogy had occurred to me
Consider this table 1
Louis 14 -- Aj
`` With no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will he was the government ``
Regency -- Truman
`` A dust-settling period of decadence and decline ``
Louis 15 -- Eisenhower
`` He opened his mouth said little and thought not at all ``
Louis 16 -- Kennedy
`` Not completely virtuous but completely incompetent ``
And Marie Antoinette -- Jacqueline Bouvier
`` The beautiful and light-hearted ``
French Revolution -- Conservative Revolution
Truly that Liberals should choose Louis 14 as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic considering the Louis 14 character of their Grand Monarque FDR not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification le roi gouverne par lui meme but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies
In defeating `` Louis Capet `` John Tower 's victory in Texas signals once again the end of the divine right of Liberalism
It seems to me that N.C. in his editorial `` Confrontation `` SR Mar 25 has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer
This affects us all intimately and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress
I know of no other solution than the one N.C. proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place
Never have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically
Thank you for the illustrated editorial `` Confrontation ``
It is both great writing and profound religion
N.C. has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece
I feel that N.C. hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` Confrontation ``
Personally it meant a great deal
my only hope is that it will be shared by many many others
`` Confrontation `` should fortify us all whether in Southeast Asia or the U.S.
Congratulations to N.C. for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the Peace Corps
I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands
It would be heartbreaking to see idealism and hence effective leadership thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run into
The editorial `` Confrontation `` was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in America
I personally gained strength from it
Thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world
N.C. 's editorial `` Confrontation `` is a stunning piece of writing
I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone entering the Peace Corps to read it
The important people to humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros but the Schweitzers and the Dooleys and the others like them whose names we will never know
Editor 's note Reprints of `` Confrontation `` will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the Peace Corps
A Peace Corps official described the editorial as `` precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be Peace Corps volunteers ``
Improper Bostonian
F. L. Lucas 's article in SR 's April 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the New English Bible
I certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers rather than the comment by Cleveland Amory in his first of the month column
It is blind fundamentalist dogmatism to say `` Messing around with the King James version seems to us a perilous sport at best ``
Facts in focus
Lester Markel is on the right track in his article `` Interpretation Of Interpretation `` SR Mar 11
The current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago
We do n't need this type of protection any more
The public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media
Besides there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about
The accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities
First it does not communicate
A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute
Second it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous
The charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation
Yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns
Despite several years of front-page stories the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating
The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions
It seems to me the time has come for the American press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends
The objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors
Southern California blackout
I would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy 's activities so far as Southern California is concerned
You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions
To begin with the all-powerful Los Angeles Times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences
I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President
Next because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day
Up until now the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 P.M. or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P.M.
Even then a few of the `` less interesting `` questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator
However last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on TV were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs
This is no criticism of them as they obviously can not get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary
The radio stations did run `` transcripts `` I thought during the evening hours
However by comparing the TV snatches two different radio station re-runs and the censored Los Angeles Times version I found that the radio stations had edited out questions ABC removed the one regarding Laos or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President 's answer
I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the `` abuse `` he is being subjected to
We out here do n't see enough of the conference to know he is being abused
I do n't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country
apparently it is not
It also happened with the Inauguration which was not re-run at all during the evening hours and I wrote to the TV editor of the Times
He did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations not doing this -- but nothing happened
Can you bring the networks attention to this
For a college of propaganda
I was interested in James Webb Young 's Madison Avenue column in which he raised the question `` Do We Need a College of Propaganda ``
SR Feb. 11
In my estimation we definitely do
and the sad part of it is that we had one which was rounding into excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die
During the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the various shades of grey in between
We had a couple of schools in this country the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out in Lloyd 's Neck
There were also a couple in Canada and several in England
The English schools preceded ours and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching
Four of us here in the United States attended first as students then as instructors almost every one of these schools in England Canada and the United States
We set up the Lloyd 's Neck school worked out its curriculum and taught there
Toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it
When the end did come and the schools were disbanded and abandoned we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust
We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so
Alas no such thing happened
There apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare
A study at the Pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there
And not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way
Congratulations on the article `` Do We Need A College Of Propaganda ``
This is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years and I certainly hope it sparks some action
Let the media clean house too
many of us in public relations were flattered that Richard L. Tobin chose to devote his editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger of the Public Relations Society of America and the American Public Relations Association
I was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published
Whether in his forthcoming book C. P. Snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important
One should be able to get hold of the book at once
But the attack was made from an advance copy
If this practice should take root and spread the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality
Editor 's note Sir Robert Watson-Watt wrote on page 50 of SR Research for 4 March 1961
`` I have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled Science And Government
Until the work actually appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail
But I have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin lectures at Harvard from which the book was derived and I can with confidence challenge the gist of C. P. Snow 's incautious tale ``
Watson-Watt 's remarks in SR did not then constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures
Representatives of Harvard University Press which is publishing the book this month of April recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book 's publication date
The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt
Sir Robert Watson-Watt 's `` rebuttal `` of Sir Charles Snow 's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself from Sir Charles supposed falsehoods while stating those `` falsehoods `` in an unclear incoherent argument
The article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning
It calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike `` a `` perverted conclusion
Nonsense ``
It submits an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than Sir Charles account
We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns
The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party
But we are to believe that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the Tizard Committee and dissembling discounted it inside
If so I would lean to Sir Charles conception of the man
I think it was a grave error to print the article at this time
To the unfortunate people unable to attend the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it
It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin
Certainly not in Orchestra Hall where he has played countless recitals and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high pale pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music or forever finds it closed
There was about that song something incandescent for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat
Not the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious or even the most eloquent
Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself
This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood
But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point
That is when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing glittering and sometimes spitting Mr. Hendl could go along
But Mr. Hendl does not go straight to any point
He flounders and lets music sprawl
There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra and music to ultimate fusion
So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein but not great Brahms
The concert opened with another big romantic score Schumann 's Overture to `` Manfred `` which suffered fate this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat
Hindemith 's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune for it demands transluscent textures buoyant rhythms and astringent wit
It got the kind of scrambled coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style
Bayreuth next summer
The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser `` staged by Wieland Wagner who is doing all the operas this time and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch
Sawalisch also conducts `` The Flying Dutch `` opening July 24
`` Parsifal `` follows July 25 with Hans Knappertsbusch conducting and he also conducts `` Die Meistersinger `` to be presented Aug. 8 and 12
The `` Ring `` cycles are July 26 27 28 and 30 and Aug. 21 22 23 and 25
Rudolf Kempe conducts
No casts are listed but Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro soprano Grace Bumbry will sing Venus in `` Tannhaeuser ``
Remember how by a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet
Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet
Well now we have two big theaters
But barring a miracle and do n't hold your breath for it Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov Ballet which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world
Before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming not once but several times indeed we did
The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in McCormick Place which Sol Hurok ballet booker extraordinary considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he does n't weep at the capacity either
It was all set
Allied Arts Corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec. 4 thru 10
Later the Hurok office made it Dec. 8 thru 17 a nice long booking for the full repertory
But if you keep a calendar of events as we do you noticed a conflict
Allied Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place Dec. 8 and 9
Something had to give
Not La Dietrich
Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking fly here to open Nov. 28 and close Dec. 2
Shorter booking but still a booking
We printed it
A couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake ``
So I started making some calls of my own
These are the results
The Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium Los Angeles Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4
Not a chance of opening here Nov. 28 -- barring that miracle
Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us
Well Dietrich wo n't budge from McCormick Place
Then how about the Civic Opera House
Well Allied Arts has booked Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4
Queried about the impasse Allied Arts said `` Better cancel the Kirov for the time being
It 's all up in the air again ``
So the Kirov will fly back to Russia minus a Chicago engagement a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country
Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium
Paintings and drawings by Marie Moore of St. Thomas Virgin Islands are shown thru Nov. 5 at the Meadows Gallery 3211 Ellis Av week days 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. Sundays 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. closed Mondays
An exhibition of Evelyn Cibula 's paintings will open with a reception Nov. 5 at the Evanston Community center 828 Davis St.
It will continue all month
Abstractions and semi-abstractions by Everett McNear are being exhibited by the University Gallery of Notre Dame until Nov. 5
In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget the Dallas Civic Opera will use San Francisco 's new Leni Bauer-Ecsy production of `` Lucia Di Lammermoor `` this season returning the favor next season when San Francisco uses the Dallas `` Don Giovanni `` designed by Franco Zeffirelli
H E. Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark Hark The Lark ``
It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season
If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans it is hard to find
Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics
Anyway a number of them meet here in devastating collisions
One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm
Another is a wily countryman called Larkin whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled I believe in earlier volumes of Mr. Bates comedie humaine
What 's up now
Well Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities
They want to own a junior-grade castle or a manor house or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers
They are willing to settle however in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at
And of course Larkin has just the thing they want
Splendor by sorcery
It 's a horror
The name of it is Gore Court and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T. S. Eliot
That 's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it though
He conjures herds of deer and wild birds crowding the air
He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor
The stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform
The vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch
Larkin has an answer to all that
The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids
Also perhaps table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented
It 's a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse
He does n't really need the immense sum of money probably converted from American gold on the London Exchange he makes them pay
For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot
He has a glorious wife and many children
When he needs money to buy something like say the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies
One of those capital-gains ventures in fact has saddled him with Gore Court
He is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands
And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it
They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox 's life on earth
First one then the other
If in Larkin 's eyes they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living
Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc
Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war
First the Larkins are ahead then the Jerebohms
After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers
One of the local callers a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling 's tales of India does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds
He does n't think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting
But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish
It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes `` Don Quixote `` is the brilliant Russian spectacle done in wide screen and color which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses
More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire Sancho Panza in seventeenth-century Spain this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character
Nikolai Cherkasov the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible performs the lanky Don Quixote and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man
His addle-brained knight-errant self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke is as Cervantes no doubt intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues
Cherkasov does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do
He treats this deep-eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect
Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world
The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue
The voices of all the characters including that of Cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform with the personalities
And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed
Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish there is no violation of artistry or logic here
Splendid too is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev one of Russia 's leading comedians as Sancho Panza the fat grotesque `` squire ``
Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too
It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons
The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island `` is one of the best in the film
True the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half before Don Quixote goes to the duke 's court
But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy
There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange
Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called `` Sunday In Greenwich Village `` a tour of the haunts and joints
Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family
There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time for example could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary
At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago And All That Jazz `` presented on NBC-TV Nov. 26
The program came out of the NBC Special Projects department and was slotted in the Du Pont Show Of The Week series
Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines
If so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents
As a matter of fact this latter approach has already been tried and with pleasing results
A few years ago a `` Timex All-Star Jazz Show `` offered a broad range of styles ranging from Lionel Hampton 's big band to the free-wheeling Dukes Of Dixieland
An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live `` character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance
About that same time John Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do
In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods
The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music
Cameras stared at soloists faces in extreme closeups then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work
`` Chicago And All That Jazz `` could not be faulted on the choice of artists
Some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden Gene Krupa Bud Freeman Pee Wee Russell Johnny St. Cyr Joe Sullivan Red Allen Lil Armstrong Blossom Seeley
The jazz buff could hardly ask for more
Furthermore Garry Moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies
He played host at the Timex show already mentioned
One of the script 's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today
NBC had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share
For example there was sheet music with the word `` jazz `` in the title to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold
Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession like telephone poles passing on the highway while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's
However well chosen and cleverly arranged such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business which considering the talent at hand should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style
Another source of NBC pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse
Similarly in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a close perusal
`` Chicago And All That Jazz `` may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer
By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either
Still the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended and future essays happily anticipated
Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia Di Lammermoor `` Sunday night
The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic `` Mad Scene `` created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers
Her entrance in Scene 2 Act 1 brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note
Thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization
As she gained composure during the second act her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia ``
She topped the sextet brilliantly
Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad Scene `` but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment
Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene A much more girlish Lucia a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her role
What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today
This big flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined
Nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly
In the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous scene magnificently
Technically it was fascinating aurally spell-binding and dramatically quite realistic
Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable
Her debut over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine
The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor Silvio Varviso
He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years
He may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them in a singers opera may be quite difficult
Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice
His bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction
The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable
Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959
The first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia
She has since turned to Bellini whose opera `` Beatrice Di Tenda `` in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season
She will sing `` La Sonambula `` with it here next week
Anyone for musical Ping-pong
It 's really quite fun -- as long as you like games
You will need a stereo music system with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and one or more of the new London `` Phase 4 `` records
There are 12 of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the star release Pass In Review SP-44001
This features the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand
Complete with crowd effects interruptions by jet planes and sundry other touches of realism this disc displays London 's new technique to the best effect
All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program
No reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music
Directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time
but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension to the music
You definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back
This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound
London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels
These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record
In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects
Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion `` or `` percussive ``
Drums xylophones castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well
Only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right
They are definitely in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley
The Percussive Twenties SP-44006 stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day and Johnny Keating 's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods SP-44005
Big Band Percussion SP-44002 seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just did n't have so much character as the others
There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies
The penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant but brassy piano sounds in Melody And Percussion For Two Pianos SP-44007
All of the releases however are recorded at a gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise
Pass In Review practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system
Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not realistic
Strange but true -- authenticity and realism often are n't related at all
Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact impeccably so
In any given period piece the costumes bric-a-brac vehicles and decor bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity
The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter
During the making recently of an important Biblical film some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors but of architectural developments sports arenas vehicles and other paraphernalia were compiled consulted and complied with
But alas the authenticity seems to stop at the set 's edge
The drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all
The storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic
Thus in `` The Story Of Ruth `` we have Ruth Naomi and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic
But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i.e that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz -- the film version has little to do with the Bible
And in the new `` King Of Kings `` the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that can not be traced to the Gospels
Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow director of the United States Information Agency came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry
He talked about unauthentic storylines too
He intimated that they were n't doing the country much good in the Cold War
And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism
`` In many corners of the globe `` he said `` the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet
Would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge
Yet for much of the globe Hollywood is just that -- prime if not sole source of knowledge
If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone what conclusions do you think he might come to
Francois D'Albert Hungarian-born violinist who made his New York debut three years ago played a return engagement last night in Judson Hall
He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory College
His pianist was Donald Jenni a faculty member at DePaul University
The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists so that for the first half of the program when the piano was partially open Mr. Jenni 's playing was too loud
In vying with him Mr. D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone
This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances however except in the case of the opening work Mozart 's Sonata in A K. 526 which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion
Brahm 's Sonata in A although also vigorous stood up well under the two artists strong large-scale treatment
Mr. D'Albert has a firm attractive tone which eschews an overly sweet vibrato
He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance
A Sonata For Violin And Piano called `` Bella Bella `` by Robert Fleming was given its first United States performance
The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada
The work 's two movements one melodically sentimental the other brightly capricious are clever enough in a Ravel-like style but they rehash a wornout idiom
They might well indicate conjugal felicity but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood
Works by Dohnanyi Hubay Mr. D'Albert himself and Paganini indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase
Standard items by Sarasate and Saint-Saens completed the program
In recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium but her program last night at Town Hall was the Greek-born pianist 's first New York recital since 1948
Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control
And the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound
Since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure
She played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures
The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century
It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best
The Rachmaninoff Prelude No 12 Op 32 for instance gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble
The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured rich in color and songful
And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs
Miss Xydis earlier selections were Mendelssohn 's Variations Serieuses in which each variation was nicely set off from the others
Haydn 's Sonata in E minor which was unfailingly pleasant in sound and Chopin 's Sonata in B flat minor
A memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist 's performance
So what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing
Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing
All the generals who held important commands in World War 2 did not write books
It only seems as if they did
And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written
One of the very best is only now published in this country five years after its first publication in England
It is `` Defeat Into Victory `` by Field Marshal Viscount Slim
A long book heavily weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally
Field Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of `` those who finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves are more interested in men and their reactions to stress hardship and danger ``
The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of course the Field Marshal himself
William Joseph Slim First Viscount Slim former Governor General of Australia was the principal British commander in the field during the Burma War
He had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared ill-equipped British forces `` were outmaneuvered outfought and outgeneraled ``
He returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas Indians Africans Chinese and British
And in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war
`` The Forgotten War `` his soldiers called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines
Parts of `` Defeat Into Victory `` are a tangle of Burmese place names and military units but a little application makes everything clear enough
On the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book
Field Marshal Slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes
He has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even `` a cardinal error ``
He praises many individuals generously
He himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers
Remaking an army to win
`` Defeat Into Victory `` is a dramatic and lively military narrative
But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action
Before he could return to Burma Field Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits
His remarks about training discipline morale leadership and command are enlightening
He believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many
He believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there
For general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly
Other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass -- British American and Chinese
health hygiene medical aid and preventive medicine
hospitals inadequate and nurses scanty
food and military supplies
logistics and transport
airdrops and airstrips
roads and river barges to be built
Expected of a commander
Commenting on these and other matters Field Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks
`` When in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the bolder ``
`` The commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty ``
`` It only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you can not give them
It depresses them
So I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it ``
Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders
Of the Japanese private he says `` He fought and marched till he died
If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves ``
Brooding about future wars the Field Marshal has this to say `` The Asian fighting man is at least equally brave as the white usually more careless of death less encumbered by mental doubts less troubled by humanitarian sentiment and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him
He is by background and living standards better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources ``
A bunch of young buckaroos from out West who go by the name of Texas Boys Choir loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience
Actually the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded and they sang it beautifully
Under the capable direction of the choir 's founder Geroge Bragg the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and Baroque madrigals and motets excerpts from Pergolesi 's `` Stabat Mater `` and all of the Britten `` Ceremonial Of Carols ``
Their singing was well-balanced clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing
The limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional waver and now and then a bleat
But Mr. Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior
Most surprising of all he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words
The Latin for example was not only clear
it was even beautiful
Furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music
Lines came out neatly and in good balance
Tempos were lively
The piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish
A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly
Other capable soloists included David Clifton Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson
The final group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume
Boys will be boys and Texans will be Texans
The combination proved quite irresistible last night
The Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze after the region of Poland where it has its headquarters opened a three-week engagement at the City Center last night
A thoroughly ingratiating company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening
Not that it is all funny by any means though some of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome high-spirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied
There is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification
The material is all basically of folk origin gleaned from every section of Poland
But under the direction of Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 it has all been put into theatrical form treated selectively choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators and performed altogether professionally
Under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training and an equally professional sense of performing
Since the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that this is not the original company
it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company
The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters
The stage is constantly full of them
indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers
They can be exuberant or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull
To pick out particular numbers is something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed
There is for example a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act
the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to music from Moniuszko 's opera `` Strasny Dwor may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see
there is an enchanting polonaise
and the dances and songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men
Everywhere there are little touches of humor and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth
The Theatre-by-the-Sea Matunuck presents `` King Of Hearts `` by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke
Directed by Michael Murray
settings by William David Roberts
The cast
Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season 's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr 's `` King Of Hearts ``
The dialogue is sharp witty and candid -- typical `` do n't eat the daisies `` material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it
The story is of a famous strip cartoonist an arty individual whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material
This is when his troubles begin not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect to the hero 's sweetheart-secretary
John Heffernan playing Larry Larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion
His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless
This may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint of David Hedison Providence 's contribution to Hollywood who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox
Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role
He does and more
But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it has to be that way
A word should be said for Gary Morgan a Broadway youngster who as the adopted son makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular
And for his playmate Francis Coletta of West Warwick who has a bit part Billy
On the whole audiences will like this performance
It is a tremendous book lively constantly moving and the Matunuck cast does well by it
The Newport Playhouse presents `` Epitaph For George Dillon `` by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton directed by Wallace Gray
The cast
The angriest young man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse where `` Epitaph For George Dillon `` opened as the jazz festival closed
For the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session
He 's mad at a world he did not make
Furthermore he 's something of a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips
This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards
They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well
It is into this household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play
An unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists
By the end of the third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other shells
Not altogether a successful play `` Epitaph For George Dillon `` overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling
It is awfully talky for instance and not all of the talk is terribly impressive
But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten
There is a fine second act as an example one in which Samuel Groom as Dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another
This is an exciting young actor to watch
Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch
Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment
Also fine are Sue Lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive Harold Cherry as her scratchy spouse and Hildy Weissman as a vegetable in human form
Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste
Still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance despair
The Warwick Musical Theater presents `` Where 's Charley
'' With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser directed by Christopher Hewett choreography by Peter Conlow musical direction by Samuel Matlowsky
The cast
Everybody fell in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater and Shelley Berman was to blame
One of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented `` Once In Love With Amy `` is also of course one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of American musical comedy in our era
So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 got a rousing opening chorus `` Where 's Charley
'' and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being
It is greatly to Berman 's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger
He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called `` Charley 's Aunt `` and let himself go with as appealing an `` Amy `` as anybody could ask
In brief Berman played himself and not Bolger
The big audience started applauding even before he had finished
The whole production this week is fresh and lively
The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days
The ballet work is on the nose especially in the opening number by `` The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students Conservatory Band `` along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later
Berman whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist proved himself very much at home in musical comedy
Sparrow-size Virginia Gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile made a suitably perky Amy while Melisande Congdon as the real aunt was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner
All told `` Where 's Charley
'' Ought not to be missed
It has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right Mr. Berman
The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C. Edwin Knill 's and Martin Tahse 's production of `` Fiorello
'' At Veterans Memorial Auditorium
The book is by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott music by Jerry Bock lyrics by Sheldon Harnick choreography by Peter Gennaro scenery costumes and lighting by William and Jean Eckart musical direction by Jack Elliott and the production was directed by Mr. Abbott
The cast
This is one of the happier events of the season
The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the Little Flower rides to break a lance again
I saw `` Fiorello
'' Performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company is every bit as good and perhaps better
Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking
Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley does but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello as the evening progressed until one had to catch one 's self up and remember that this was n't really LaGuardia come back among us again
Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben the distraught Republican Party district chieftain
And Paul Lipson as Morris the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley 's dinner was fine too
As for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest little man
Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie who became the second Mrs. LaGuardia singing and acting with remarkable conviction
Jen Nelson as Thea his first wife managed to make that short role impressive
And little Zeme North a Dora with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings
Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On The Side Of The Angels `` and `` Politics And Poker `` were handled splendidly and I thought Rudy Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little Tin Box `` even better than it was done by the New York cast
all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity
The party at Floyd 's penthouse gave the `` chorines `` a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense
LaGuardia 's multi-lingual rallies when he is running for Congress are well staged and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater
Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions
Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one
The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that does n't pause long in any one place and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness
Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes
I 'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction in this `` Fiorello
It has all been done in superb style and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater
Loew 's theater presents `` Where The Boys Are `` an MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells
The cast
Since the hero a sterling and upright fellow is a rich Brown senior while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` Where The Boys Are `` but I shall do nothing of the sort
Instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- I hasten to report that it 's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say sex
The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual
If most of them were n't exactly specific -- well that 's the way it is in life I guess
But at least it 's reassuring to see some teenagers who do n't profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead
`` Where The Boys Are `` also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy
There are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid `` is performing
Most of the female faces are new or at least not too familiar
Dolores Hart is charming in a leading role and quite believable
I was delighted with Paula Prentiss comedy performance which was as fresh and unstilted as one 's highest hopes might ask
A couple of the males made good comedy too -- Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin
The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases I suppose this was the attitude the part called for
I must say however that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it
To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining
The second feature `` The Price Of Silence `` is a British detective story that will talk your head off
The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters
Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking
To both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment
For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James 's genius not to mention the felicities of his style
And how he could write
His famous criticism of brother Henry 's `` third style `` is surely as subtly even elegantly worded an analysis of the latter 's intricate air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced
His letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor
Most of all his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead 's reference to James as `` that adorable genius ``
Miss Hardwick speaks of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship `` and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism
This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought
It holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual `` has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues
To his Harvard colleague Josiah Royce whose philosophic position differed radically from his own James could write `` Different as our minds are yours has nourished mine as no other social influence ever has and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly ``
Of another colleague George Santayana he could write `` The great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana 's book
Although I absolutely reject the Platonism of it I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page ``
Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer -- `` Glorious old Palmer `` as he addresses him -- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce Santayana Palmer and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions ways of fronting life and worth fighting for `` then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe
`` The best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems
The world might ring with the struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other ``
The `` belaboring `` is of course jocular yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God
To James this vision never quite came despite his appreciation of it in others
But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent `` You ask what I am going to reply to Bradley
But why need one reply to everything and everybody
I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations
All polemic of ours should I believe be either very broad statements of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible impersonally
As far as the rising generation goes why not simply express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other
Here again God will know his own ``
The collected works of James Thurber now numbering 25 volumes including the present exhibit represent a high standard of literary excellence as every schoolboy knows
The primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall is equally well known
About all that remains to be said is that the present selection most of which appeared first in The New Yorker comprises as usual a slightly unstrung necklace held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book
The one unifying note if any is sounded in the initial article entitled `` How To Get Through The Day ``
It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs the hospitalized and others forced to rely on inner resources including in the P 's alone `` palindromes `` `` paraphrases `` and `` parodies ``
`` The Tyranny Of Trivia `` suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber
And new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled `` Friends Romans Countrymen Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs `` `` Such a Phrase as Drifts Through Dream `` and `` The New Vocabularianism ``
Some of Thurber 's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor malapropism and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases
A burlesque paean entitled `` Hark The Herald Tribune Times And All The Other Angels Sing `` brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey
`` How The Kooks Crumble `` features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-TV commercials and `` The Watchers Of The Night `` is a veritable waking nightmare
A semi-serious literary document entitled `` The Wings Of Henry James `` is noteworthy if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master 's difficult later period by modest Owen Wister author of `` The Virginian ``
James he remarks in a letter to a friend `` is attempting the impossible namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces upon the gazer a number of superimposed simultaneous impressions
He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once and get all at once the various shadings and complexities ``
Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation `` So much has already been written about everything that you ca n't find out anything about it ``
Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance also a quotation `` Woman 's place is in the wrong ``
Who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences
A tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes `` seems terribly funny though it would be hard to explain why
`` One of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out of bed
It 's just a bat said my wife reassuringly and I sighed with relief
Thank God for that I said
I thought it was a human being ``
In a sense perhaps Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter was it Salvador Dali
who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen
That is it is literally a picture window you do n't see into the viscera
you see a picture -- trees or flowers
This is something like what Thurber 's best effects are like if I am not mistaken
Though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches several old favorites are scattered through the present volume Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple unaffected humanness
In his concluding paragraph he writes `` The devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can ``
For many readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight
The latest Low is a puzzler
The master 's hand has lost none of its craft
He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties
The reader meets a few old friends like Blimp and the TUC horse and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out
But there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low
There is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show
But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning
Anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference
It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key
But this argument can not be pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion
The Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler
And the leading issue that of piecemeal aggression remains the same
This is drama enough
Do we ourselves offer Mr. Low less of a crusade
In the thirties we would not face our enemy
that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element
Now we have stood up to the Communists
we are stronger and more self-confident -- and Low can not so easily put us to rights
Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere
It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now
He writes `` Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime ``
Whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic
Dulles
He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man
McCarthy
The skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath
Suez
Low seems to have supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently so there is no fire in his eye
Stalin 's death Churchill 's farewell to public life Hillary and Tensing on Everest Quemoy and Matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade
Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles
Their Eisenhower is insubstantial
Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections
He often drew the bomb
He showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines
And Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all
But but and but
Look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale
Read the moderately brief text not for captions sometimes for tart epigrams once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas
A gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man city slicker lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from Mr. Burman 's refreshing Louisiana animal community
The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New Orleans accompanied by one wharf rat
But like all despots as he builds his following from among the gullible he grows more threatening toward those who wo n't follow -- such solid citizens as Doc Raccoon
Judge Black the vegetarian black snake
and the eagle who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces
As soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats who of course say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city
The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others
They train the mink and other animals to fight
And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he wo n't have anyone around that 's against him and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds
Robert Hillyer the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr. Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series
He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes
But it 's hard to imagine Mr. Burman as a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables
In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus and the polished witty fables of James Thurber
George Kennan 's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2 is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years
It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work Scrupulous scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era 's great historical issues
In short the book based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard University is both reliable and readable
the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time
If Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well the record itself is not too encouraging
Mr. Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken
But he rejects perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February 1945
After all Alger Hiss subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents was at Yalta
And Harry Dexter White implicated in F.B.I reports in Communist associations was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have simply handed Germany to Stalin
One item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength
It is quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender `` had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism
Mr. Kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way
`` You see first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender The tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy 's power no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future ``
Recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-Nazi underground which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944
A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language history and literature Kennan recalls how at the time of Hitler 's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 he penned a private note to a State Department official expressing the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries ``
The hope was vain
With justified bitterness the author speaks of `` what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian Communist movement about the history of its diplomacy about what had happened in the purges and about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic States ``
He also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's `` puerile `` assumption that `` if only he Stalin could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F.D.R himself ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia 's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged ``
No wonder Khrushchev 's first message to President Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days `` of Roosevelt
This fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in personal detail of the glancing mutual impact of World War 1 and the two instalments of the Russian Revolution
The first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in March 1917
the second the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks who later called themselves Communists in November of the same year
As Kennan shows the judgment of the Allied governments about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession of defeating Germany
They were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting
They attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue
This more than any other factor led to the fiasco of Allied intervention
As the author very justly says
`` Had a world war not been in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the imagination have been an Allied intervention in North Russia ``
The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda
here Kennan operating with precise facts and figures performs an excellent job of debunking
Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author 's vivid style the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected
On Stalin
`` This was a man of incredible criminality of a criminality effectively without limits
a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe
a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment
a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime
And here is Kennan 's image of Hitler Stalin 's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples and his later enemy
`` Behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead behind the tirades and the sulky silences the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare behind the prejudices the cynicism the total amorality of behavior behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes there lay a statesman of no mean qualities Shrewd calculating in many ways realistic endowed -- like Stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired yet bold and resolute in his decisions and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word ``
Two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan
And in a concluding chapter about America 's stance in the contemporary world one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time How to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war
But one should not ask for everything
Mr. Kennan who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future
The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations is vitally important and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator
The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm
In `` Donnybrook `` there is quite a different Eire a rural land where singing dancing fist-fighting and romancing are the thing
There is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed
By and large Robert McEnroe 's adaptation of Maurice Walsh 's film `` The Quiet Man `` provides the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one
This is the tale of one John Enright an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man
But Innesfree where Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother Will live is no place for a man who will not use his fists
So Enright 's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably thereby providing the tale which is told
You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means
Then there is a matchmaker one Mikeen Flynn a role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected
Now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs torso and neck except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play
Mr. Foy is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect
His matchmaking is naturally incidental and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony
Art Lund a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonates Enright
Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique that 's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have anyway
Joan Fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not plays Ellen and sings the role very well too
If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind
she fits into the general scheme well enough
Susan Johnson as the widow spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one
She has a good firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening
Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they 're quite entertaining
And in the role of Will Danaher Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British army if he chose
`` Donnybrook `` is no `` Brigadoon `` but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing
The ballads are sweet and sad and the music generally competent
It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain and some of it such as the catchy `` Sez I `` does
`` A Toast To The Bride `` sung by Clarence Nordstrom playing a character called Old Man Toomey is quite simple direct and touching
The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters and their dancing and singing is fine
So is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole 's expert choreographic direction
The male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating
Rouben Ter-Arutunian in his stage settings often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr. Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow
There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at `` Donnybrook `` unless they are permanently in the mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable Irish
We can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously too -- because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show `` Fanny `` into a delightful and heart-warming film
The task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol 's original trio of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom was a delicate and perilous one indeed
More than the fans of Pagnol 's old films and of their heroic star the great Raimu were looking askance at the project
The fans of the musical were too
But now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music Hall yesterday
Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show whether partial to music or not you ca n't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart
Some of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow
A tiny handful never did make the concert
But after a fifteen-minute delay the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon 's proceedings
They faced a rather small audience as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon
It was an excellent concert
Paul Paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid musician and the Philharmonic plays for him
Their collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding
It was not a heavy ponderous Beethoven
The music sang nicely sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced
The Franck symphonic poem `` Psyche `` is a lush sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again
Fortunate for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor
if it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying
Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score
He did not let the strings for instance weep whine or get hysterical
His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy
And in the Prokofieff C major Piano Concerto with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner
Mr. Skolovsky 's approach to the concerto was bold sweeping and tonally percussive
He swept through the music with ease in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner
An impressive technician Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot
His tone is the weakest part of his equipment
it tends to be hard and colorless
A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs
It is after all a non-romantic work even with the big juicy melody of the second movement
and the composer himself was called the `` age of steel pianist ``
But granted all this one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than Mr. Skolovsky supplied
Taken as a whole though it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra
Mr. Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received
A new work on the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff 's `` Festival Overture `` receiving its first New York hearing
This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry
It is not program music though
It runs a little more than ten minutes is workmanlike busy methodical and featureless
`` La Gioconda `` like it or not is a singer 's opera
And so of course it is a fan 's opera as well
Snow or no the fans were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli work
So the plot creaks the sets are decaying the costumes are pre-historic the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing
After all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed with no less than six leading parts
One of those parts is that of evil evil Barnaba the spy
His wicked deeds were carried on by Anselmo Colzani who was taking the part for the first time with the company
He has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone
What was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after all a very oily character
Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect to this season
they have both sung these parts here before
Laura is a good role for Miss Resnik and she gave it force dramatic color and passion
Mr. Siepi was as always a consummate actor
with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently
Part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the vocal chords
His singing was strong and musical
unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality
Eileen Farrell in the title role Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and all contributed to a vigorous performance
If only they and Fausto Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more
`` Melodious birds sing madrigals `` saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could be imagined
Their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces BG 609
stereo BGS 5031 is a good sample of the special elegant art of English madrigal singing
It also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French `` chansons ``
The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else
The original impulses came to England late in the sixteenth century and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo sonatas operas and the like
Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum the practice of singing together -- choruses catches and glees -- always flourished
The English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way say the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal
Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England much ahead of similar revivals in other countries
As a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the English madrigal
Naturally Mr. Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen William Byrd Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins
There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture
Both techniques give the music purity and clarity
Claude Jannequin 's vocal description of a battle the French equivalents of tarantara rum-tum-tum and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque is lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus
Only with the more sensual intense and baroque expressions of Marenzio Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial
Nevertheless the musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently reproduced make it an attractive look-see at the period
The works are presented chronologically
Texts and translations are provided
Elegance and color
The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics
Baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled and quite abstract
In France it remained always more picturesque more dancelike more full of flavor
Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense of `` program music `` but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance
Both composers turn up on new imports from France
BAM is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is Editions De La boite A Musique
They specialize in out-of-the-way items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention
Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin Le Grand occupy two disks LD056 and LD060 and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate flexible and gemlike
The Concerts -- nos 2 6 9 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense
The sonatas `` La Francaise `` `` La Sultane `` `` L'Astree `` and `` L'Imperiale `` are often more elaborately worked out and in fact show a strong Italian influence
Couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called Musique Francaise Du 18e Siecle BAM LD 060
Jean-Marie LeClair still is remembered a bit but Bodin De Beismortier Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words
What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo
The Couperin `` La Steinkerque `` with its battle music brevity wit and refined simplicity already shakes off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era
If Couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more
All these records have close attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic
Rameau 's Six Concerts En Sextuor recorded by L'orchestre De Chambre Pierre Menet BAM LD 046 turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself
The strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious
Maitres Allemands Des 17e et 18e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel Buxtehude Rosenmueller and Telemann well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket BAM LD 035
Rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in Carnegie Recital Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts
Works by J. C. Bach Anton Craft Joseph Haydn Giuseppe Sammartini Comenico Dragonetti and J. G. Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff flutist Josef Marx oboist and Robert Conant pianist and harpsichordist
Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez
Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday night
Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program but taken together they grew quite tiresome
The performances were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying some by soloists proving rather trying
Ellie Mao soprano and Frederick Fuller baritone presented a program of folksongs entitled `` East Meets West `` in Carnegie Recital Hall last night
They were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee pianist
Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages
Songs from China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao who is a native of China and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr. Fuller who is English by birth
This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles
On the contrary Miss Mao and Mr. Fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as Mendelssohn Dvorak Canteloube Copland and Britten
There was therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise
The performances were assured communicative and pleasingly informal
What was omitted from `` A Neglected Education `` were those essentials known as `` the facts of life ``
Chabrier 's little one-act operetta presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall is a fragile precious little piece very French not without wit and charm
The poor uneducated newlywed a certain Gontran De Boismassif has his problems in getting the necessary information
The humor of the situation can be imagined
It all takes place in the eighteenth century
What a silly artificial way of life Chabrier and his librettists chuckle
But they wish they could bring it back
Chabrier 's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical rationalist tradition handed down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music becomes virtually neo-classicism
The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish
The simple clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes
Arlene Saunders was charming as poor Gontran
Yes Arlene is her name
the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano
Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring
The work was presented as the final event in the Town Hall Festival of Music
It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera `` The Poor Sailor `` set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea a sailor returns unrecognized and gets done in by his wife
With the exception of a few spots Milhaud 's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties odd harmonies and lumbering satiric orchestration
Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon
Sat there and as a woman sang she kept getting thinner and thinner right before my eyes and the eyes of some 5,500 other people
I make this observation about the lady Miss Judy Garland because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote in the paper the next day
`` Judy Garland has arrived in London
She 's not chubby
She 's not plump
She 's fat ``
But who cares when the lady sings
Certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet
They applauded every number not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord
And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed at times a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings
Things like `` When You 're Smiling `` `` Almost Like Being In Love `` `` Do It Again `` `` Born To Wander `` `` Alone Together `` `` Who Cares
'' `` Puttin On The Ritz `` `` How Long Has This Been Going On
'' And her own personal songs like `` The Man That Got Away `` and the inevitable `` Over The Rainbow ``
Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen
At the start of her program there were evidences of pique
She had held to the letter of her contract and did n't come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m. the appointed hour although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3
Then there was a bad delay in getting Mort Lindsey 's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs
Along about 4:30 just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side Judy came on singing in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind
Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing
In her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm lenses and shoot at extreme range
There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` Do It Again `` and she made the tart observation that `` I never saw so much moving about in an audience ``
But it did n't take Judy Garland showman long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it
Before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music trundling microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere
And time after time she really belted out her songs
Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way I felt about her `` Come Rain or Come Shine `` -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her shatteringly beautiful `` Beautiful Weather ``
To her partisan audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise
they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough
They were rewarded with splendid exciting singing
Her `` Rockabye Your Baby `` was as good as it can be done and her really personal songs like `` The Man That Got Away `` were deeply moving
The audience would n't let her leave until it had heard `` Over The Rainbow `` -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` Get Happy `` had to go home unhappy about that item anyway
She was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers
All went home happy except the Newport police who feared that the throng departing at 6:35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar
In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies
This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance but no storm
Several times it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry Mulligan 's big band which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap
Mulligan 's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations
But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan 's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer 's arrangement of `` Django 's Castle ``
For subtle swinging rhythms I could admire intensely Mulligan 's version of `` Weep `` and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 Carrots For Robert `` a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges
There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group
Unfortunately Blakey does n't choose to work much of the time in this vein
He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like
What we did get however was impressive
A few drops of rain just before midnight when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of her first number scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand most of the listeners did n't care whether they got wet
Miss Vaughan was back in top form somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine
After the spate of female vocalists we have been having all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever
Jazz Three open program
The evening program was opened by the Jazz Three a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein on bass Jack Warner drums and Don Cook piano
This was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night when the Eddie Stack group also local talent went on first
Putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience
The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship not only in their own chosen set but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns Leon James the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program
Julie Wilson sings
Julie Wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as `` Hard-Hearted Hannah The Vamp Of Savannah `` and the delightful `` Sunday ``
She frosted the cake with the always reliable `` Bill Bailey ``
From this taste of the 1920s we leaped way out to Stan Getz 's private brand of progressive jazz which did lovely subtle things for `` Baubles Bangles And Beads `` and a couple of ballards
Getz is a difficult musician to categorize
He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over
In this he is sticking with tradition however far removed from it he may seem to be
Shearing takes over
George Shearing took over with his well disciplined group a sextet consisting of vibes guitar bass drums Shearing 's piano and a bongo drummer
He met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo
Shearing himself seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances
A very casual pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make Newport 's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach
Divided almost equally into two parts it consisted of `` The Evolution Of The Blues `` narrated by Jon Hendricks who had presented it last year at the Monterey Calif. Jazz Festival and an hour-long session of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra a blasting big band
Hendricks story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him
Tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches
To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had `` Big `` Miller as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean Gospel-singer while Oscar Brown Jr. an extremely talented young man did a slave auctioneer 's call a field-hands work song and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby `` Brown Baby `` which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival
One of those delightful surprise additions which so frequently occur in jazz programs was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones drumming to `` Old Man River `` which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year 's concerts
Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues was Michael Babatunde Olatunji who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest
He has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year 's afternoon concerts
Hendricks had Billy Mitchell tenor sax
Pony Poindexter alto sax
Jimmy Witherspoon Blues singer and a good one and the Ike Isaacs Trio which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical examples
It all went very well
Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert 's Sonatas
Music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example played for RCA by Emil Gilels
He has chosen Sonata Op 53 in Aj
The playing takes both sides of the disc
Perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length
Rhythmic interest melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one 's attention with the Gilels playing
His technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully
The male chorus of the Robert Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style
The group is superbly trained
What a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question
Do you say chantey as if the word were derived from the French word chanter to sing or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin which derives its name from the French-Canadian use of the word chantier with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard
I say chantey
Either way the Robert Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening
If your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one
The London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini a baritone whose fame is international
Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work `` Signal `` and the repetition of an earlier one `` Journal ``
`` Signal `` is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg
Program note reads as follows
`` Take hands
this urgent visage beckons us ``
Here as in `` Journal `` Mr. Louis has given himself the lion 's share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements
Indeed both `` Journal `` and `` Signal `` qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics
But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing
One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development
It may be of course that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation
But it may be also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time
One thing is certain however and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be
an American journey
A brisk satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled `` An American Journey `` was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company
Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris `` Once Upon A Time `` as well as her `` Women 's Song `` and Mr. Nagrin 's `` Indeterminate Figure ``
Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` An American Journey `` and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes
Mr. Nagrin has described four `` places `` each with its scenery and people added two `` diversions `` and concluded with `` A Toccata for the Young `` a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing
The `` places `` could be anywhere the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody 's and the laugh is on us all
But we need not mind too much because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way
Miss Tamiris `` Once Upon A Time `` is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures `` that bother them somehow
Unfortunately the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so
Nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time
The music here Russell Smith 's `` Tetrameron `` sounded good
All the performances of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company with Mr. Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers seemed to be fine shape
The Symphony Of The Air greatly assisted by Van Cliburn last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start
At the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs repeating each of them in five different communities
This news announced by Jerome Toobin the orchestra 's administrative director brought applause from the 2,800 persons who filled the hall
They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony
This season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County Center in White Plains
The details of the suburban concerts next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced later Mr. Toobin said
The concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky the Rachmaninoff Third and the Prokofieff Third
It was pleasant last night therefore to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded `` The Emperor ``
The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him
But they were not what distinguished his performance
The elements that did were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo
Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne
Alfred Wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding poetic mystery
The collaboration was remarkable as it was in both the other movements too
Mr. Wallenstein who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the `` Leonore `` Overture No 3 and the Fourth Symphony
The orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively
And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven
Igor Oistrakh will be the next soloist on Feb. 4
There are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in
Today in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it
In the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit
Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins `` The Man I Love ``
Deemed too static when it was first heard in `` Lady Be Good `` in Philadelphia in 1924 it was dropped from the score
It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of `` Strike Up The Band `` and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up
It finally reached Broadway in the second and successful version of `` Strike Up The Band `` in 1929
Still another song in `` Strike Up The Band `` -- `` I 've Got A Crush On You `` -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure `` Treasure Girl ``
Like the Gershwins Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them
If one of Mr. Rodgers melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show
Several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory in a delightfully refreshing album Rodgers And Hart Revisited Spruce Records 505 Fifth Avenue New York
Among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of `` The Garrick Gaieties `` an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed
Dorothy Loudon 's raucous listing of the attractions `` At The Roxy Music Hall `` from `` I Married An Angel ``
and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of `` I Blush `` a song that was cut from `` A Connecticut Yankee ``
Altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists
Norman Paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment
Turning to the current musical season on Broadway the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying has been transferred to an original cast album R. C. A. Victor LOC 1066
stereo LSO 1066 that has some entertaining moments although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect
Robert Morse singing with comically plaintive earnestness carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in Frank Loesser 's score
Rudy Vallee who shares star billing with Mr. Morse makes only two appearances
He shares with Mr. Morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia Martin a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice
In general Mr. Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer
Like Mr. Loesser Jerry Herman is both composer and lyriist for Milk And Honey R. C. A. Victor LOC 1065
stereo LSO 1065 but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics
For this story of an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel Mr. Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles
There are the full-bodied resourceful voices of Robert Weede Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most of Mr. Herman 's lilting melodies and for an occasional change of pace the bright humor of Molly Picon
Mr. Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms
Not content to create only the music and lyrics Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away Capitol WAO 1643
stereo SWAO 1643 a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr. Coward 's more memorable works
The melodies flow along pleasantly as Mr. Coward 's songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality
Elaine Stritch who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness belts some life into most of her songs but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr. Coward 's songs
With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2 -- `` The House I Live In `` `` The Cranes Are Flying `` and `` Ballad Of A Soldier `` -- we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in `` The Day The War Ended ``
It simply is n't not by a long shot
The Artkino presentation with English titles opened on Saturday at the Cameo Theatre
Make no mistake this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave carefully written performed and directed
In describing the initial Allied occupation of a middle-sized German city the picture has color pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments
Told strictly from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple at both sides of the conflict 's aftermath
Unfortunately the whole picture hinges on this romance at the expense of everything else
Tenderly and rather tediously the camera rivets on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they do n't want to hurt
It 's the old story war or no war and more than one viewer may recall Hollywood 's `` Titanic `` several seasons back when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante
Not that the picture is superficial
Under Yakov Segal 's direction it begins stirringly as crouching Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other waiting for the first surrender gesture
One high-up camera shot is magnificent as the Germans straggle from a cathedral dotting a huge cobblestone square and drop their weapons
Ring Of Bright Water by Gavin Maxwell
211 pages
Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience
`` Ring Of Bright Water `` by Gavin Maxwell is just that -- a haunting warmly personal chronicle of a man an otter and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands
`` He has married me with a ring of bright water `` begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys
The place is Camusfearna the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of Skye
It is a land of long fjords few people a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags Greylag geese wild swans dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters
How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift the subtle changes in season over ten years is a moving experience
Just the evocations of time and place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost would be enough
But it is n't
There is Mijbil an otter who travelled with Maxwell -- and gave Maxwell 's name to a new species -- from the Tigris marshes to his London flat
It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature
This is not only a compliment to Mijbil of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub 's journey by plane from Iraq to London then by train where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap to Camusfearna with affectionate detail
Mij as his owner was soon to learn had strange inexplicable habits
He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth
He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow
Systematically he would open and ransack drawers
Given a small ball or marbles he would invent games and play by himself for hours
With curiosity and elan he explored every inch of glen beach and burn once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell who nearly lost his life in doing so
A year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted but self-discovery as well
In the solitude of Camusfearna there had been no loneliness
`` To be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating
it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses ``
Now with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need that of being trusted implicitly by some creature
Two other people in time shared Mijbil 's love `` it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water
we were his Trinity and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and irritation
In turn each of us in our own way depended as gods do upon his worship ``
Yet the idyll ended
The brief details of Mijbil 's death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy
Man to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man
But then through a strange coincidence Maxwell manages to acquire Idal a female otter and the fascinating story starts once more
One is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- Mijbil with his rollicking ways or Maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid and unabashed
This reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement
Now Gavin Maxwell 's Ring Of Bright Water has widened to enchant the world
-- The performances of the Comedie Francaise are the most important recent events in the New York theater
They serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century
On the contrary the old plays are continually being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie
Of course the well-received revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism
The directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who in two instances this season closed their plays after one performance
But they are aware of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic
In France novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted
The government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere 's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results
So far as I know the Comedie has never put Moliere 's people in the costumes of the 20th century but they do reinterpret plays and characters
Last season the Comedie 's two principal experiments came to grief and in consequence we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine 's `` Phedre `` and Moliere 's `` School For Wives ``
The new `` Phedre `` was done in 17th century setting instead of ancient Greek
perhaps that is the Comedie 's equivalent for thrusting this play 's characters into our own time
The speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance
A few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent
The new `` School For Wives `` was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character
Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while Fernand Ledoux often performing at the Comedie made them more gross than Moliere may have intended
Apparently Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in `` The School For Wives ``
I say `` apparently `` although I saw Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death
by that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy
Arnolphe it will be recalled is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be
The part can lend itself to serious treatment
one influential French critic remarked `` Pity for Arnolphe comes with age ``
Accordingly at the Comedie last year Jean Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy
But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly
Wisely the Comedie has brought Moliere 's `` Tartuffe `` on its tour and has left `` The School For Wives `` at home
Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor 's wife
Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot and Ledoux at the Comedie made him a gross buffoon or so the historians tell us
Louis Seigner who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux is the Tartuffe of the present production which he himself directed
His Tartuffe observes the golden mean
His red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality
But his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory
of course they do not reflect sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation
Occasionally Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another
The whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his other parts
His normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly
Here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of meanness and slyness
Seigner is the dean of the company the oldest actor in point of continuous service
In that function he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie
We are often told that the Comedie has unfortunately life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage
Seigner however is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company
among his other parts are the leads in `` The Bourgeois Gentleman `` and `` The Imaginary Invalid ``
In Moliere 's farce `` The Tricks Of Scapin `` Robert Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles
Here some innovation is attempted
To begin with Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master
Hirsch 's Scapin is healthy cheerful energetic revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves
Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world
And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody 's servant
Django Reinhardt the ill-fated gypsy was a true artist one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels
There is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who does n't owe something to Django
And Django owed much to Louis Armstrong
He told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea Market in Paris
It was the first jazz he had heard
Django who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in Belgium and who died in 1953 in France was an extraordinary man
Most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette
And this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz
You can catch up with him -- if you have n't already -- on RCA-Victor 's album
`` Djangology `` made up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France
This is a choice item and Grappely deserves mention too of course
He is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin
They play `` Minor Swing `` `` Honeysuckle Rose `` `` Beyond The Sea `` `` Bricktop `` `` Heavy Artillery `` `` Djangology `` `` After You 've Gone `` `` Where Are You My Love ``
`` I Saw Stars `` `` Lover Man `` `` Menilmontant `` and `` Swing 42 ``
All this is great proceedings -- get the minutes
Kid Ory the trombonist chicken farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz
He dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans
His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember
Good Time Jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made
He is starred against Alvin Alcorn trumpet
Phil Gomez clarinet
Cedric Haywood piano
Julian Davidson guitar
Wellman Braud bass and Minor Hall drums
The set contains `` High Society `` `` Do What Ory Say `` `` Down Home Rag `` `` Careless Love `` Jazz Me Blues `` `` Weary Blues `` `` Original Dixieland One-Step `` `` Bourbon Street Parade `` `` Panama `` `` Toot Toot Tootsie `` `` Oh Did n't He Ramble `` `` Beale Street Blues `` `` Maryland My Maryland `` `` 1919 Rag `` `` Eh La Bas `` `` Mood Indigo `` and `` Bugle Call Rag ``
All this will serve to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems
Mischa Elman shared last night 's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers
His portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin to wit the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky
That is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man
Mr. Elman is 70 years old
There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman
But with all due respects and allowances it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet more mannered than musical
The occasion was sentimental
so was the playing
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston 's Dance Overture William Schuman 's `` Chester `` From `` New England Triptych `` and two works of Wallingford Riegger Dance Rhythms Op 58 and a Romanza For Strings Op 56A
The Creston is purely a potboiler with Spanish English French and American dances mixed into the stew
The Riegger with its Latin hesitation bounce is just this side of the pale
like his sweet attractive Romanza it belongs to what the composer called his `` Non-Dissonant Mostly `` category of works
The Schuman `` Chester `` takes off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect
All these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively colorful unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors
It was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change
We have Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony
A woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of `` A Question Of Adultery `` yesterday 's new British import at the Apollo
Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise the film 's extensive discussion of the problem seems at best superfluous
In its present artless low-budget form the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath
With Julie London enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive
The explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident
Anthony Steel as the husband is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce labeling her action adulterous
The actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of Don Chaffey as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father and Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander
After a protracted hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility the jury to no one 's surprise leaves the legal question unresolved
When the husband drops the case and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place
So was the audience
London July 4
-- For its final change of bill in its London season the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a `` gala program `` at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden
No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far it too could give a circus if it pleased
And please it did in every sense of the word for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of London audiences
At the end of the program indeed there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes and nothing could stop it
Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number `` Taras Bulba `` but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all
Only a plea from the house manager John Collins finally broke up the party
But for all the manifest intention to `` show off `` this was a circus with a difference for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company
The `` Taras Bulba `` excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol 's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music of Soloviev-Sedoi
It is danced by some thirty-five men and no women and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy gregarious cavorting and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human body perform
Yuri Soloviev Oleg Sokolov Alexei Zhitkov Lev Sokolov Yuri Korneyev and Mr. Livshitz were the chief soloists but everybody on stage was magnificent
At the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the Petipa-Minkus ballet `` Bayaderka `` which opened the evening
What a man this Petipa was
And why do we in the West know so few of his ballets
This scene is a `` white ballet `` in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love 's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful `` shadows `` who can all dance like nothing human -- which of course is altogether fitting
The ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as loveliness and adagio is the general medium of the piece
Its ballerina Olga Moiseyeva performs simple miracles of beauty and Ludmilla Alexeyeva Inna Korneyeva and Gabrielle Komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments
Sergei Vikulov as the lone male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the work is designed to belong to the ladies
The middle section of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of unequal merit but all of them pretty good at that
They consisted of a new arrangement of `` Nutcracker `` excerpts danced stunningly by Irina Kolpakova and Mr. Sokolev with a large ensemble
a winning little `` Snow Maiden `` variation by the adorable Galina Kekisheva
two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils and superb esthetic acrobacy by Alla Osipenko and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna Zubkovskaya and Yuri Kornevey in the other
an amusing character pas de cinq called `` Gossiping Women ``
a stirring `` Flames Of Paris `` pas de deux by Xenia Ter-Stepanova and Alexandre Pavlovsky and a lovely version of Fokine 's `` Le Cygne `` by Olga Moiseyeva which had to be repeated
Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor
It was quite an evening
A year ago today when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking in Los Angeles and John F. Kennedy was still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the Presidency Theodore H. White had already compiled masses of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960
As the pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated Mr. White took more notes
He traveled alternately with Mr. Kennedy and with Richard M. Nixon
He asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates `` in-groups ``
He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in general as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election in American history
Those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election
how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr. White in `` The Making Of The President 1960 ``
This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one
What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history
Mr. White who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter
His zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book
A lesson in politics
As a dramatic narrative `` The Making Of The President 1960 `` is continuously engrossing
And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational
The author begins this volume with a close-up of Mr. Kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns
He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls five Democrats -- Senator Hubert H. Humphrey Senator Stuart Symington Senator Lyndon B. Johnson Adlai E. Stevenson and Mr. Kennedy -- and two Republicans -- Governor Rockefeller and Mr. Nixon
Then in chronological order Mr. White covers the primary campaigns the conventions and the Presidential campaign itself
In the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race religion local tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television
Mr. White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions
He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse 's mouth from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy himself
but never from Mr. Nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust
`` Rarely in American history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less `` says Mr. White
Mr. Nixon he believes has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign
Although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man Mr. Nixon Mr. White believes ignored his own top-level planners wasted time and effort in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television
Mr. Nixon is `` a broody moody man given to long stretches of introspection
he trusts only himself and his wife
He is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary uncertain impulses
He was above all a friend seeker almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked
He wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them
the least inspiring candidate since Alfred M. Landon ``
Mr. Kennedy Mr. White believes `` had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him ``
Calm dignified composed `` superbly eloquent `` Mr. Kennedy always knew everything about everybody
He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers
Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds
Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance
Mr. Kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters
Mr. White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr. Kennedy to be a fine President
Throughout `` The Making Of A President `` Mr. White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how subordinates play key roles
And he makes many interesting comments
Here are several
`` The root question in American politics is always Who 's the Man to See
To understand American politics is simply to know people to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes who are straw men who controls who does not
But to operate in American politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection ``
`` In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion ``
`` All platforms are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it ``
Nostalgia week at Lewisohn Stadium which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts
Miss Pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments
The better part of gallantry might be perhaps to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing
No orchestra however could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as Miss Pons encountered last night
In all fairness there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate vocalism
One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer 's `` Shadow Song ``
The years suddenly fell away at this point
On the whole however one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on
Sharing the program was the young French-Canadian tenor Richard Verreau making his stadium debut on this occasion
Mr. Verreau began shakily with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume
Later on this problem vanished and the `` Flower Song `` from Bizet 's `` Carmen `` was beautifully and intelligently projected
Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener
Lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible
The mushrooming of FM outlets offering concerts both jazz and classical lectures and other special events is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity
Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners -- an audience which in the United States comprises some 19,000,000 people with 20,000,000,000 to spend each year
Of course the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching
He even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials
But the growing number of Negro-appeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects
It is estimated that more than 600 stations of a total of 3,400 do a significant amount of programing for the Negro
At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states
These and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine a trade publication for radio and TV advertisers
For 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio
In the past 10 years Sponsor observes these trends have become apparent
Negro population in the U.S. has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent
`` The forgotten 15 million `` -- as Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million
Advertisers are changing their attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it
Stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational economic and cultural levels
Futhermore the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects not simply serve on the air
In the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent according to a research man quoted by Sponsor
A year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business
The 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth
It also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the U.S. Negroes live outside the southeastern states
Also the state with the largest number of Negroes is New York -- not in the South at all
In New York City WLIB boasts `` more community service programs than any other Negro station `` and `` one of the largest Negro news staffs in America ``
And WWRL 's colorful mobile unit cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods is a frequent reminder of that station 's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests
Recently WWRL won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit
A half-dozen other stations in the New York area also bid for attention of the city 's Negro population up about 50 per cent in the past decade
In all big cities outside the South and even in small towns within the South radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners
The Keystone Broadcasting System 's Negro network includes 360 affiliated stations whose signals reach more than half the total U.S. Negro population
One question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro is moving into a fully integrated status
Whatever the long-range impact of integration the owners of Negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal
Advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests
And many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only from a fact sheet
What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows
Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular Negro bands and singers
rhythm-and-blues mood music
`` race `` music folk songs and melodies and gospel programs
Furthermore news and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station
Advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special Negro concern
Sponsor quotes John McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious of quality and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race
he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous ``
The sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of J. Walter Carroll of KSAN San Francisco
`` Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions achievements and desires
It will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life
Negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation ``
Presentation of `` The Life And Times Of John Sloan `` in the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art
Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist 's widow Helen Farr Sloan to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan 's work
From early family portraits painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year 1951 and still part of his estate
Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived
Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness
The paintings drawings prints and illustrations all reflect the manners costumes and mores of America in the first half of the present century
Obviously Sloan 's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri
As early as 1928 however the Sloan style began to change
The dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette
The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes
The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan 's many-sided art
In addition to the paintings are drawings prints and illustrations
Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of McSorley 's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs
One of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is `` Sun And Wind On The Roof `` with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds
Although there are landscapes in the show one of the strongest is a vista of `` Gloucester Harbor `` in 1915 the human element was the compelling factor in Sloan 's art
Significant are such canvases as `` Bleeker Street Saturday Night `` with its typically American crowd Sloan never went abroad
the multifigure `` Traveling Carnival `` in which action is vivified by lighting
or `` Carmine Theater 1912 `` the only canvas with an ash can and foraging dog although Sloan was a member of the famous `` Eight `` and of the so-called `` Ash-Can School `` a term he resented
Not all the paintings however are of cities
The exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest `` Koshare in the Dust `` a vigorous Indian dance and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette
The fact that Sloan was an extrovert concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle
There are 151 items in the Wilmington show including one painting by each member of the `` Eight `` as well as work by Sloan 's friends and students
Supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence diaries books from the artist 's library etc
All belong to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs. Sloan who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art Students League New York in the 1920 's
To enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries the Delaware Art Center according to its director Bruce St. John will maintain a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works as well as a card index file
The entire Sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians
The current exhibition which remains on view through Oct. 29 has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources
Any musician playing Beethoven here where Beethoven was born is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care
In a sense he is offering Bonn what its famous son who left as a youth never did -- the sound of the composer 's mature style
Robert Riefling who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd Beethoven Festival penetrated deep into the spirit of the style
His readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative without being presumptuous
The 32 C Minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline
The D Minor Sonata Op 31 No 2 introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come
These inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of `` opera style `` of which Beethoven was genuinely capable but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging
Two late Sonatas Op 110 and 111 were played with similar insight the disarming simplicities of the Op 111 Adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious
The two were separated from each other by the Six Bagatelles of Op 126
Herr Riefling in everything he gave his large Beethoven Hall audience proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority
Volker Wangenheim who conducted Bonn 's Stadtisches Orchester on the following evening made one more conscious of the process of interpretation
Herr Wangenheim has only recently become the city 's music director and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium
But he weighted the Eighth Symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music
He might have been hoping to all appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program could amount to something like the Ninth
but no amount of head-tossing could make it so
The conductor 's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed it did so with plenty of spring
The concerto 's soloist Hans Richter-Haaser played with compensatory ease and economy though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling
His was a burgomaster 's Beethoven solid and sensible
Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy For Piano Chorus And Orchestra In C Minor made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs
The entrance of the Stadtisches Gesangverein Bonn 's civic chorus was worth all the waiting however as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life
The last program of this festival which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories brought the Cologne Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester and Rundfunkchor to Bonn 's gold-filled hall for a performance of the Missa Solemnis
A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise
This theory eventually proved inexact
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science
It is the business of cosmologists the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors
These keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge
In the autumn of 1959 the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology
Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator
The participants were Professor H. Bondi professor of mathematics at King 's College London
Dr. W. B. Bonnor reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College London
Dr. R. A. Lyttleton a lecturer at St. John 's College Cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge
and Dr. G. J. Whitrow reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology London
Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator
The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called `` Rival Theories Of Cosmology ``
Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on the general theory of relativity
First of all and this has been calculated by observation the universe is expanding -- that is the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds
Because of this Dr. Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there
This expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years
Expands and contracts
Dr. Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in
Then after many more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again
Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory
He supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space
For this reason he says the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions
New galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies
If this is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe is expanding
For new galaxies to be created Professor Bondi declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years
He contends this idea does n't conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments
Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons
Protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter
The charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but Dr. Lyttleton is not so sure
Suppose says Dr. Lyttleton the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron so slight it is presently immeasurable
This would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess
Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere
Because electrical forces the charge-excess are far more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere
Dr. Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it
This he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe
This slim book while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has
Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field
It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science
Presently the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth 's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation
These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth 's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories
There would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions
In doing away with the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos
And although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man
`` Roots `` the new play at the brand-new Mayfair Theater on 46th St. which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an English farm girl
Highly successful in England before its transfer to New York most of `` Roots `` is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy
Only in its final scene where Beatie Bryant Mary Doyle shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts
The burden of Mr. Wesker 's message is that people living close to the soil at least in England are not the happy fine strong natural earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine
Rather they are genuine clods proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought
They care no more for politics says Mr. Wesker than they do for a symphony
Seeming to have roots in the soil they actually have none in life
They dwell in short in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived
But this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as Mr. Wesker dedicates to it
So much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer unless he has been living in a gilded palace perhaps and wants a real big heap of contrast
The messy meals the washing of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such a thing as redundancy
Now for the good points
Miss Doyle as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a warm smile
She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie we never do see him and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating including a dose of good British socialism
But while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal
Beatie getting no sympathy for her misfortune soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom
Despite a too long sustained declamatory flight this final speech is convincing and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by `` Roots ``
There were several fairly good minor portraits in the play including William Hansen 's impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic father and Katherine Squire 's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin nonsense from her daughter or anyone else
But I am afraid Mr. Wesker 's meat and potatoes dish is n't well seasoned enough for local audiences
Shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night 's `` Much Ado About Nothing `` opening the season of free theatre in Central Park
The New York Shakespeare Festival which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed began bravely
Joseph Papp impassioned founder of the festival and director of `` Much Ado `` had a vibrant colorful production under way
Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare 's words in a spirited mixture
The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence
The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised chuckles
The simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers heads evoked laughter
The vivacity of the masquers party at Leonato 's palace with the Spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon cast a spell of delight
As `` Much Ado `` turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar a sprinkle began to fall
At first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas were opened
But the rain came more heavily and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart
The grieving Hero and her father Leonato followed by the Friar left the stage
A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes
More than half the audience departed
Some remained in the Wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads
Others huddled under the trees outside the fence
Twenty minutes after the interruption although it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped
Beatrice Nan Martin and Benedick J. D. Cannon took their places on the stage
In their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare like a Nostradamus had foreseen this moment
Said Benedick `` Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while ``
Replied Beatrice `` Yea and I will weep a while longer ``
The heavens refused to give up their weeping
The gallant company completed Act 4 and got through part of Act 5
But the final scenes could not be played
If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort
`` Much Ado `` ends happily
The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare
One could hardly blame Newbold Morris the Parks Commissioner for devoting so much grateful mention to the department 's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms its balcony its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains
Eldon Elder who designed the stage also created a gay spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare 's lighthearted mood
Mr. Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints
Still a demurrer or two must be entered
Schwarzkopf is of course Schwarzkopf
For style and assurance for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her
If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful instrument controlled and flexible
Put to the service of lieder of Schubert Brahms Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way it made its effect with ease and precision
But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism
Instead of her old confidence in the simplest purest most moving musical expression Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside
The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable
Clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little too melodramatic
There was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in the interest of effect
The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness
There were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication
Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist John Wustman often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills
Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them
The dance dancers and dance enthusiasts 8,500 of them had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs
On Saturday the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved
There was additionally a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons
Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first New York performance of Mr. Ailey 's `` Roots Of The Blues `` a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival
Otherwise the program included as on Thursday the Taras-Tchaikovsky `` Design For Strings `` the Dollar-Britten `` Divertimento `` the Dollar-De Banfield `` The Duel `` and the pas de deux from `` The Nutcracker ``
Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn who danced the `` Nutcracker `` pas de deux were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from `` Don Quixote `` another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely
Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` The Duel `` a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants
Mr. Ailey 's `` Roots Of The Blues `` an earthy and very human modern dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening
As Brother John Sellers sang five `` blues `` to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating threatening contemptuous and ecstatic
Their props were two stepladders a chair and a palm fan
He wore the clothes of a laborer and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress
The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps lifts crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong sometimes almost frightening tensions
`` Roots Of The Blues `` may not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its super-charged impact
`` Perhaps it is better to stay at home
The armchair traveler preserves his illusions ``
This somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` Blue Skies Brown Studies `` a collection of travel essays by William Sansom who would never consider staying home for long
Mr. Sansom is English bearded formidably cultivated the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between
The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty her third and an American multimillionaire his fourth
The result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices
There are sixteen essays in `` Blue Skies Brown Studies ``
Most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines
All are well written and are overwritten
But even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can charm and astound
Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another
Mr. Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of English with a thick shower of sophisticated cultural references
A contemplative connoisseur
`` I like to sniff a place and reproduce what it really smells and looks like its color its particular kind of life ``
This is an exact description of what Mr. Sansom does
He ignores guidebook facts
He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions
It is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past
William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London Vienna the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords
But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions
`` A writer lives at best in a state of astonishment `` he says
`` Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all
To transmit that feeling he writes ``
This may not be true of many writers but it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom
So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez
at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City
at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world 's finest restaurants La Bonne Auberge which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport
and at the infinite variety of London
Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls to those who recall easily the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto
He can coin a neat phrase `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people ``
tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel 's ears ``
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity ``
And for all his lacquered almost Byzantine self-consciousness he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison
Beauty borrowed from afar
In one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza
How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus
`` The white colonnaded cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips ``
Nice even if a trifle gaudy
`` Blue Skies Brown Studies `` is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs
In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio
WBAI the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void
Yesterday it offered `` Poised For Violence `` by Jean Reavey
WBAI is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate
Unfortunately `` Poised For Violence `` was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point
Mrs. Reavey 's work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall -- and in addition employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged
The play 's device is to explore society 's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist 's models who remain part of someone else 's painting rather than just be themselves
In a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty
Somewhere in Mrs. Reavey 's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit
But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener 's stamina begins to wilt
Moreover her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind 's ills
But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author 's words
Which in itself is an immediate reward of the WBAI experiment
good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration
A weekly showcase for contemporary music from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month
Titled `` What 's New In Music ``
The enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station Aj
The brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze
The show is programed and written by the station 's assistant continuity editor Chuck Briefer
The first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings
Last Saturday 's interesting melange included Ernst Toch Karlheinz Stockhausen Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space `` opera by the Swedish composer Karl-Birger Blomdahl
Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer a particular type of music or the music of a given country
It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene
But one wishes when the appetite is whetted as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions
The Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close
It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody 's heart
It is good to see those numbers again
The `` Suite Of Old Russian Dances `` that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth
the amusing `` Yurochka `` in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance
the lovely and of course vigorous `` Polyanka `` or `` The Meadow ``
the three Moldavian dances entitled `` Zhok ``
the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` Bul'ba ``
and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` City Quadrille `` are all just as good as one remembers them to have been and they are welcome back
So for that matter are the newer dances -- the `` Kalmuk Dance `` with its animal movements that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called `` The Platter `` the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` Summer `` `` The Three Shepherds `` of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs and of course the trenchant `` Rock 'n Roll ``
As autumn starts its annual sweep few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world 's finest fall coloring
Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth
The only other regions so blessed are the British Isles western Europe eastern China southern Chile and parts of Japan New Zealand and Tasmania
Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson gold purple bronze blue and vermilion that flame up in North America
Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle
in fact a freezing autumn dulls the blaze
The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain followed by sunny days and cool nights
Foliage pilgrimages either organized or individual are becoming an autumn item for more and more Americans each year
Below is a specific guide keyed to the calendar
Late September finds Quebec 's color at its peak especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area south of the St. Lawrence River
In the Maritime provinces farther east the tones are a little quieter
Ontario 's foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10 with both Muskoka 100 miles north of Toronto and Haliburton 125 miles northwest of Toronto holding color cavalcades starting Sept. 23
In the Canadian Rockies great groves of aspen are already glinting gold
New England
Vermont 's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept. 25 to Oct. 15 and often hit a height in early October
New Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches
The shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of Maine
In western Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut the Berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of October
Middle Atlantic states
The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October choice routes being 9N from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area

A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque 's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957
If this was in fact Mr. Remarque 's intention he has achieved a notable failure
Clerfayt of `` Heaven Has No Favorites `` resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver whereas Portago was a good one
He is a dull unformed and aimless person
the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent purposeful and passionate
One looked forward to Mr. Remarque 's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised
Unhappily `` Heaven Has No Favorites `` does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list
Mr. Remarque 's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble
He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery
His treatment of it is something else
His heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium being higher than she wishes to pay
Her lover precedes her in death at the wheel and presumably he too has chosen
Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse some demure and rather fetching love-making pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe and a modicum of automobile racing
The ramblings on life death and the wonder of it all are distressing
the love-making perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness is often charming
the automobile racing bears little relation to reality
This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as say a tournament golfer
Hazards to life and limb on the golf course while existent are actuarially insignificant
Race-drivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit and since it was obviously Mr. Remarque 's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes
He does not
The jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature
Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal
The book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing
The necessity is not clear to me and in any case to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car which or whom he calls `` Giuseppe `` parked `` on the Place Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around him `` is not a liberty
it is an absurdity
But it is in the matter of preoccupation with death which is the primary concern of the book that Remarque 's failure is plainest
Clerfayt is neurotic preoccupied and passive
To be human he believes is to seek one 's own destruction the Freudian `` death-wish `` cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers
In point of fact the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live
A Clerfayt may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit
a Portago could say as he did say to me `` If I die tomorrow still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years
but I sha n't die tomorrow
I 'll live to be 105 ``
Clerfayt transported may think of the engine driving his car as `` a mystical beast under the hood ``
The Italian master Piero Taruffi no less sensitive knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car 's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae
Clerfayt driving sees himself `` a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell ``
the Briton Stirling Moss one of the greatest virtuosi of all time believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet
Errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr. Remarque hoped to tell us
However my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists
The west is leaderless according to this book
In contrast the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev Tito and Mao
Against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all
It is Field Marshal Montgomery 's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity
about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy
But these Western countries do care about themselves
Each feels intensely national
If say the Russians intended to stop Tom Jones going to the pub then Tom Jones would fight the Commies
But he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as `` cause ``
For all practical purposes the West stands disunited undedicated and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership
With this barrage Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West
Never given to mincing words he places heavy blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America
At war 's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state
With Britain looking inward overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States
Montgomery believes that she started well
`` America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike ``
She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace
America has divided more than she has united the West
The reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars and that she compulsively strives to be liked
However she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed
But the greater reason for fumbling stumbling American leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor
`` They are determined `` Montgomery writes `` not to be surprised again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible ``
The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad
To `` Monty `` the American people who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight `` now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War ``
As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead
The path to leadership is made clear
Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West 's own house in order
Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence
This leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United States namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany that the East German government does not exist that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired that the true government of China is in Formosa that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960 and that either China or Russia wants or expects war
Such a leader must strengthen NATO politically and establish that true unity about which it has always talked
After drastically overhauling NATO Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the East and West
Major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories say by 1970
`` The West should make the central proposal
but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out ``
`` But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us ``
Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy
The man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is De Gaulle
He alone has the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach a decision
But De Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France 's lost soul
Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership
The leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself lead a carefully regulated and orderly life allow time for quiet thought and reflection adapt decisions and plans to changing situations be ruthless particularly with inefficiency and be honest and morally proper
All in all Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him
In looking as far back as Moses thence to Cromwell Napoleon Lincoln Churchill and Nehru Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men
He believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler 's war
However Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice
Most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene
Like Eisenhower he holds the militarist 's suspicion of politicians
However at the same time Montgomery selects as his hero De Gaulle who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions
`` Monty `` shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support
For the most part his writing rambles and jogs preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts
Nevertheless Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world
It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership
And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events
It is no common thing for a listener critical or otherwise to hear a singer `` live `` for the first time only after he has died
But then Mario Lanza was no common singer and his whole career public and non-public was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital `` only when he has ceased to be a living voice
It is a kind of justice too that it should originate in London 's Royal Albert Hall where traditionally the loudest if not the greatest performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate RCA Victor LM 2454 4.98
To be sure Lanza made numerous concert tours here and abroad but these did not take him to New York where the carping critic might lurk
The reading public the theatergoing public the skindiving public the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in U.S. life but none is so varied vast and vigilant as the eating public
The Department of Agriculture averaged out U.S. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs per person which allowing for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs or more a day
That mother hen of the weight-height tables the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. clucks that 48 million Americans are overweight
Through previous centuries eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees and mostly toward just getting enough
Now big forces buffet food
For the first time in history the U.S. has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the Government 's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce
In this same society the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume
Refrigeration automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage
And in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health
To eat is human the nation is learning to think to survive divine
Fads facts
Not all the concern for health is well directed
From the fusty panaceas of spinach eggs and prunes the U.S. has progressed to curds concentrates and capsules
Each year reports the American Medical Association ten million Americans spend 900 million on vitamins tonics and other food supplements
At juice bars in Los Angeles 35 `` health `` stores a new sensation is a pink high-protein cocktail concocted of dried eggs powdered milk and cherry-flavored No-Cal which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz glass
Grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all
But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health and a big group of U.S. scientists wants to supply them
The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota 's Physiologist Ancel Keys 57 inventor of the wartime K for Keys ration and author of last year 's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well
From his birch-paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene under the university 's football stadium in Minneapolis `` We get a rumble on every touchdown `` blocky grey-haired Dr. Keys directs an ambitious 200,000-a-year experiment on diet which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing
Pursuing it he has logged 500,000 miles suffered indescribable digestive indignities and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini
He has measured the skinfolds the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades of Neapolitan firemen studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters analyzed the `` mealie-meal `` eaten by Capetown coloreds and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen
And fats
Keys 's findings though far from complete are likely to smash many an eating cliche
Vitamins eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on though mothers milk is still the ticket
Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack
Already many an American knows his count and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 safe or 250 dangerous
Out of cholesterol come Keys 's main messages so far
Americans eat too much
The typical U.S. daily menu says Dr. Keys contains 3,000 calories should contain 2,300
And extra weight increases the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack
Americans eat too much fat
With meat milk butter and ice cream the calorie-heavy U.S. diet is 40 fat and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind says Dr. Keys that increases blood cholesterol damages arteries and leads to coronary disease
Obesity a malnutrition
Throughout much of the world food is still so scarce that half of the earth 's population has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life
The deficiency diseases -- scurvy tropical sprue pellagra -- run rampant
In West Africa for example where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals a childhood menace is kwashiorkor or `` Red Johnny `` a growth-stunting protein deficiency signs reddish hair bloated belly that kills more than half its victims leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease
In the well-fed U.S. deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years
Today as Harrison 's Principles Of Internal Medicine a standard internist 's text puts it `` The most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity ``
Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin
Says Keys `` Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral the fat man would start to think ``
Morals aside the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him
The simple mechanical strain of overweight says New York 's Dr. Norman Jolliffe can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built ``
The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums
He has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25 higher death rate from cancer
He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes
He may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement
Physiologically people overeat because what Dr. Jolliffe calls the `` appestat `` is set too high
The appestat which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant is located says Jolliffe in the hypothalamus -- near the body 's temperature sleep and water-balance controls
Physical exercise raises the appestat
So does cold weather
In moderate doses alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite the original reason for the cocktail
but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz -- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry
In rare cases diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently destroying nearly all sense of satiety
Food for frustration
Far more frequently overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion
It may be fostered by frustration depression insecurity -- or in children simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother 's nagging
Some families place undue emphasis on food conversations center on it and rich delicacies are offered as rewards withheld as punishment
The result says Jolliffe `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life ``
Food may act as a sedative giving temporary emotional solace just as for some people alcohol does
Reports Dr. Keys `` A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more
He may be interested in another woman or just like being with the boys
So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake
It 's a matter of boredom and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something because she 's being deprived of something else ``
For the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won
Physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines Benzedrine Dexedrine as dangerous `` crutches for a weak will ``
Keys has no such objections to Metrecal Quaker Oats 's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters
`` Metrecal is a pretty complete food `` he says
`` It contains large amounts of protein vitamins and minerals
In the quantity of 900 calories a day anyone will lose weight on it -- 20 30 or 40 lbs. ``
But Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food
That remarkable cholesterol
Despite his personal distaste for obesity `` disgusting `` Dr. Keys has only an incidental interest in how much Americans eat
What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation 's No 1 killer coronary artery disease which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer five times the deaths from automobile accidents
Cholesterol the cornerstone of Dr. Keys 's theory is a mysterious yellowish waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol
Scientists assume that cholesterol from the Greek chole meaning bile and sterios meaning solid is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells since it accounts for about 2 of the brain 's total solid weight
They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones
They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system
But they can not fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver
Although the fatty protein molecules carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water soluble cholesterol itself is insoluble and can not be destroyed by the body
`` A remarkable substance `` says Dr. Keys `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries ``
When thus deposited Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks
Explains Keys As the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream they are deposited in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery
The proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left behind
As cholesterol piles up it narrows irritates and damages the artery encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation
Eventually says Keys one of two things happens
A clot forms at the site seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack
Or more commonly thinks Keys the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery 's flow to the point that an infarct occurs the heart muscle is suffocated cells supplied by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps fatally injured
Fats coronaries
Ordinarily the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body 's needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile
Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods eaten in normal amounts says Dr. Keys do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood
But fatty foods do
During World War 2 doctors in The Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact despite the stresses of Nazi occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping
Not until long after the war -- 1950 in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason
That year Sweden 's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods
That same year the University of California 's Dr. Laurance Kinsell timing oxidation rates of blood fats stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to rise
Here Keys and others such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each
All natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated
The degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule
Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens
Mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens
The three fats have similar caloric values about 265 calories per oz but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol
